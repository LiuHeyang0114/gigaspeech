AUD0000000116_S0000807 SIGNALING SILENTLY TO EACH OTHER
AUD0000000116_S0000814 FRANKS STOPPED MOVING BACK
AUD0000000116_S0000821 AN ENDLESS MOMENT WITHOUT MEASURE
AUD0000000116_S0000827 MOSS BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF

AUD0000000116_S0000837 AROUND THEM THE LEADYS WATCHED SILENT AND IMPASSIVE
AUD0000000116_S0000842 HE WAS NUMB WITHOUT FEELING OF ANY KIND
AUD0000000116_S0000847 FRANKS TURNED HIS FACE PALE AND VACANT
AUD0000000116_S0000852 IF YOU HAD GONE BACK WHEN WE ASKED YOU YOU WOULD NOW BE SAFELY DOWN BELOW
AUD0000000116_S0000859 BY THAT TIME THE CYCLE WILL HAVE ENTERED ITS LAST STAGES
AUD0000000116_S0000866 THE LEADY REGARDED THE THREE MEN CALMLY
AUD0000000116_S0000871 BOMBS ARE PLACED JUST ABOVE THE FIRST STAGE OF EACH TUBE FOR SUCH EMERGENCIES
AUD0000000116_S0000876 WHAT DO YOU SAY WE CAN'T GO BACK
AUD0000000116_S0000881 THEY WERE STANDING OUTSIDE LOOKING AT THE VALLEY AND THE SKY
AUD0000000116_S0000886 THE RUSSIANS HAVE GIVEN UP THEIRS AS YOU CAN SEE
AUD0000000116_S0000891 WE HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO SPEAK FOR OUR COUNTRY MOSS SAID STIFFLY
AUD0000000116_S0000896 THE RUSSIANS HALTED AND THEY FACED EACH OTHER WITH RAW HOSTILITY
AUD0000000116_S0000902 IT WOULD BE USELESS HEROISM
AUD0000000116_S0000908 AND GENERALLY MAKE OURSELVES COMFORTABLE
AUD0000000116_S0000913 BUT WE'LL HAVE TO MANAGE
AUD0000000116_S0000918 WE FINALLY SETTLED IN THE MOST MODERN VILLAGE WE COULD FIND
AUD0000000116_S0000923 YOU PROBABLY HAVE A THING OR TWO TO TEACH US YOURSELVES SAID TAYLOR GENEROUSLY THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT
AUD0000000116_S0000928 THE LEADY STEPPED BETWEEN THEM
AUD0000000116_S0000935 PEOPLE WHO WORK TOGETHER DON'T NEED DIPLOMATS
AUD0000000116_S0000941 MARY WAS UNDERSURFACE THERE
AUD0000000116_S0000946 IT HAS TAKEN THOUSANDS OF GENERATIONS TO ACHIEVE THE A-CLASS LEADY CONCLUDED
AUD0000000116_S0000953 THE MEANING OF LIFE MOSS ADDED
AUD0000000116_S0000958 BUT IT WILL BE UNIMAGINABLY GREAT
AUD0000000145_S0000010 THEY ARE THE SCOURGES THAT LASH OUR MINDS IN MODERN DAYS
AUD0000000145_S0000015 A CHILD WOULD LAUGH AT IT
AUD0000000145_S0000021 THE MENU THAT I ATE THROUGH AS A BOY
AUD0000000145_S0000026 YET NOW I HAVE A HIDDEN BOOK LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD
AUD0000000145_S0000031 THAT MY MIND WORKS MORE EASILY WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE PEN
AUD0000000145_S0000037 YET HE IS ABNORMALLY CLEVER HIS RECORD PROVES THAT
AUD0000000145_S0000042 AS ONE OF THE OUTSIDE PUBLIC MIGHT READ
AUD0000000145_S0000047 I SHALL BE CURED
AUD0000000145_S0000052 MOST BOYS ARE CRUEL I THINK
AUD0000000145_S0000057 THE DESIRE TO TORTURE WAS IN NEARLY ALL OF THEM
AUD0000000145_S0000062 IF A MASTER WERE KIND OR GENTLE OR SHY
AUD0000000145_S0000067 CRUELTY IS HORRIBLE
AUD0000000145_S0000072 IF WE CAN NOT BE THE TORTURED AS WELL AS THE TORTURER
AUD0000000145_S0000077 WHY NOT
AUD0000000145_S0000082 MY PEOPLE WERE PRETTY WELL OFF AND I WAS THEIR ONLY CHILD BUT MY CHIEF CHANCES OF FUTURE PLEASURE IN LIFE WERE CENTRED IN MY GRANDMOTHER MY MOTHER'S MOTHER
AUD0000000145_S0000087 WHY DID I EVER PLAY MY CHILDISH CARDS TO WIN THIS HOUSE THIS PLACE
AUD0000000145_S0000092 BUT SHE WAS SAID TO BE NEAR DEATH
AUD0000000145_S0000097 THOUGH ALMOST A CHILD I WAS NOT SHORT-SIGHTED
AUD0000000145_S0000102 AND THOUGHT OF THE FELLOW WHO WAS MY BOSOM FRIEND
AUD0000000145_S0000107 BUT WHEN I APPROACHED IT I HEARD IT PURR COMPLACENTLY
AUD0000000145_S0000112 SHE SAT IN HER CHAIR ALL DAY AND LOOKED AT THE FIRE
AUD0000000145_S0000117 IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF IT UNDERSTOOD WHAT MY GRANDMOTHER DID NOT
AUD0000000145_S0000122 I HATED THE CAT UTTERLY
AUD0000000145_S0000128 AND WHEN A YOUNG MAN
AUD0000000145_S0000133 HE WANDERED THROUGH SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND
AUD0000000145_S0000138 HE FOUND AT LAST WHAT HE DESIRED
AUD0000000145_S0000144 THE HOUSE IS WONDERFULLY SITUATED
AUD0000000145_S0000149 IS LIKE NO OTHER GARDEN I EVER SAW
AUD0000000145_S0000154 QUAINT RECESSES
AUD0000000145_S0000159 I WISH I HAD NEVER GONE TO THAT DINNERPARTY AND MET THE PROFESSOR
AUD0000000145_S0000164 WHY CANNOT MEN LEAVE LIFE ALONE
AUD0000000145_S0000169 I WONDER I WONDER IF SHE IS ASLEEP
AUD0000000145_S0000174 LIKE MOST OLD DYING PEOPLE
AUD0000000145_S0000179 SHE SEEMED TRYING TO LIVE IN MY LIFE
AUD0000000145_S0000184 AND SHE PUT OUT HER WHITE CORRUGATED HAND AND FONDLED MY WARM BOY'S HAND
AUD0000000145_S0000189 THAT SEEMED SITTING ON THE DOORSTEP OF THAT HOUSE HUDDLED UP LIKE A BEGGAR WAITING FOR THE DOOR TO BE OPENED
AUD0000000145_S0000194 I LOOKED AT THE CAT WHICH AS USUAL WAS SITTING BEFORE THE FIRE
AUD0000000145_S0000199 BY THE TONE OF A VOICE
AUD0000000145_S0000204 NOW WHEN I APPROACHED HER
AUD0000000145_S0000209 SHE ALWAYS SAT VERY CLOSE TO MY GRANDMOTHER NOW
AUD0000000145_S0000214 I BEGAN TO GROW DESPERATE
AUD0000000145_S0000219 HE WILL BE PAID IN FULL FOR EVERY MOMENT HE LOSES
AUD0000000145_S0000225 A LITHE YOUNG FIGURE
AUD0000000145_S0000230 AS IS THE CASE SO OFTEN WITH LADS AT SCHOOL
AUD0000000145_S0000235 AND OBEYED ALL HER INSUFFERABLY TIRESOME BEHESTS
AUD0000000145_S0000240 HE WROTE TO ME FURIOUS LETTERS
AUD0000000145_S0000245 IT NEVER PURRED NOW
AUD0000000145_S0000250 I THINK THE CAT UNDERSTOOD QUITE WELL
AUD0000000145_S0000255 THE DOWN-DROOP OF THE FEATURES
AUD0000000145_S0000260 I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF MORBID IMAGINATION AT THAT AGE
AUD0000000145_S0000266 TRACKED MY THOUGHTS
AUD0000000145_S0000271 THAT THE CAT UNDERSTOOD ALL
AUD0000000145_S0000276 I HAD THOUGHT THERE WAS A SIMILARITY BETWEEN THEM
AUD0000000145_S0000281 AND WOULD ALWAYS BE SO
AUD0000000145_S0000287 AS IT MUST BE AT LAST
AUD0000000145_S0000292 AND HAD EVEN I SHOULD SAY
AUD0000000145_S0000297 AGREEING WITH ALL THE OLD BANALITIES SHE UTTERED
AUD0000000145_S0000302 IT KNEW AS I KNEW
AUD0000000145_S0000308 SMOOTHING ITS THICK WHITE COAT
AUD0000000145_S0000313 TURNED ITS FACE TO MINE
AUD0000000145_S0000318 THE GLOW OF THE ROSES FLUSHED THE GARDEN WAYS
AUD0000000145_S0000323 HER CHEEKS WERE NO LONGER FINE IVORY WHITE A DULL SICKENING YELLOW PALLOR OVERSPREAD THEM
AUD0000000145_S0000328 AND MOVED PERPETUALLY IN A SILENT CHATTERING
AUD0000000145_S0000333 DEATH IS UNCANNY LIKE ALL SILENT THINGS
AUD0000000145_S0000338 SO SHE WAS PLACED IN HER CHAIR EACH DAY BY THE FIRE
AUD0000000145_S0000343 AND I WAITED TOO
AUD0000000145_S0000348 HE SAID THE TERM WAS OVER
AUD0000000145_S0000354 BUT HE ADDED
AUD0000000145_S0000359 ALL THAT WAS GOOD IN MY NATURE CENTRED ROUND WILLOUGHBY
AUD0000000145_S0000364 PERHAPS I SHOULD NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN EVEN IF I DID TIME WOULD HAVE CHANGED HIM
AUD0000000145_S0000369 FOR THE MOMENT I WAS CARRIED OUT OF MYSELF
AUD0000000145_S0000374 AND DROVE SELF-INTEREST AWAY
AUD0000000145_S0000379 THE EYES GAZED AT ME BUT SO HORRIBLY
AUD0000000145_S0000384 I FELT HER WITHERED HANDS THEY WERE ICE
AUD0000000145_S0000389 CROUCHED THE CAT
AUD0000000145_S0000394 AND YET TO-NIGHT THE MEMORY OF THAT MOMENT AND WHAT FOLLOWED IT
AUD0000000145_S0000399 LED TO THE GATES OF TERROR BY MY OWN FANCIES
AUD0000000145_S0000405 HARK THE BIRDS ARE TWITTERING IN THE DEW OUTSIDE
AUD0000000145_S0000410 MY BRAIN IS NOT CALM
AUD0000000145_S0000422 HE WROTE TO ME ONCE OR TWICE FROM NEW YORK AND THEN I CEASED TO HEAR FROM HIM
AUD0000000145_S0000427 WHAT DID IT MATTER
AUD0000000145_S0000432 I STUDIED PLAYED GOT INTO MISCHIEF AND OUT OF IT AGAIN LIKE OTHER BOYS BUT IN MY LIFE THERE SEEMED TO BE AN ETERNAL COLDNESS THAT I ALONE PERHAPS WAS CONSCIOUS OF
AUD0000000145_S0000438 MUST ITS SOUL DIE WHEN IT DIES
AUD0000000145_S0000443 THAT IS WHAT I MUST ARRIVE AT IF I AM TO BE HAPPY
AUD0000000145_S0000448 I DID WELL THERE AND I PASSED ON INTO THE WORLD
AUD0000000145_S0000453 AND TRIED TO SQUEEZE IT DRY
AUD0000000145_S0000458 I NEED NOT EXPLAIN THAT
AUD0000000145_S0000463 AND SHE WAS VALSING AT A BIG BALL IN LONDON HER FIRST BALL
AUD0000000145_S0000468 NATURALLY FLUFFY IT NEARLY CONCEALED THE WHITE RIBAND THAT RAN THROUGH IT
AUD0000000145_S0000473 FOR SHE SEEMED SO HAPPY AND AT THAT TIME HAPPINESS WON MY LANGUID WONDER
AUD0000000145_S0000478 ANOTHER DANCE BEGAN
AUD0000000145_S0000483 I GREW INTERESTED IN HER EVEN ACUTELY SO
AUD0000000145_S0000488 AND I APPROACHED MY HOSTESS
AUD0000000145_S0000493 IT WAS HER HUMANITY THAT DREW ME NOTHING ELSE
AUD0000000145_S0000498 BUT MY BLOOD RAN COLD AND MY PULSES ALMOST CEASED TO BEAT
AUD0000000145_S0000503 THE BAND PLAYED A VALSE AND THE INEXPLICABLE HORROR THAT HAD SEIZED ME LOST ITSELF IN THE GAY MUSIC
AUD0000000145_S0000508 THE SPIRIT OF YOUTH IN HER KNOCKED ON MY RATHER JADED HEART
AUD0000000145_S0000513 INCLINED EVEN TO A RADIANT THOUGH FOOLISH
AUD0000000145_S0000518 QUITE INCONSIDERATE IN SUMMONING MY ADHERENCE TO THEM
AUD0000000145_S0000523 SOME VERY FAINT RECOLLECTION AWOKE AND STIRRED IN MY MIND
AUD0000000145_S0000528 CHASING THE VAGRANT RECOLLECTION THAT ELUDED ME
AUD0000000145_S0000533 IF WE HAD SEEN EACH OTHER SURELY WE SHOULD RECOLLECT IT
AUD0000000145_S0000538 I ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO CALL
AUD0000000145_S0000543 AND WAS IT LOVE THAT LAID TO SLEEP RECOLLECTION THAT SANG A LULLABY TO AWAKENING HORROR AND STREWED POPPIES OVER IT TILL IT SIGHED ITSELF INTO SLUMBER
AUD0000000145_S0000548 I HARDLY KNOW
AUD0000000145_S0000553 SHE GAVE HER CHILD'S HEART TO MY KEEPING WITH A PERFECT CONFIDENCE THAT ONLY A PERFECT AFFECTION COULD ENGENDER
AUD0000000145_S0000558 FOR GREAT CHANGES IN THE HUMAN MIND ARE TERRIBLE
AUD0000000145_S0000563 EVERY WORD OF THE LETTER WITHIN MAY BECOME ALTERED
AUD0000000145_S0000568 AFTER A YEAR OF LOVE-MAKING
AUD0000000145_S0000573 WE TRAVELLED FOR NEARLY SIX MONTHS
AUD0000000145_S0000578 THE CURRENT OF MY LIFE BEGAN TO SET IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION
AUD0000000145_S0000583 LISTENING TO IT
AUD0000000145_S0000588 AT LAST IN THE LATE SPRING WE STARTED FOR HOME
AUD0000000145_S0000593 SHE WAS FULL OF EXCITEMENT AND HAPPINESS
AUD0000000145_S0000598 IN THE DISTANCE THE SEA WAS TOSSING AND TUMBLING
AUD0000000145_S0000603 JUST BEGINNING TO BE TINGED WITH THE FAINTEST ROSE
AUD0000000145_S0000608 I FEEL NEAR THE HEART OF NATURE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS SHE SAID
AUD0000000145_S0000614 GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE THAT WAS WAITING FOR US
AUD0000000145_S0000619 A VILLAGE AN ABRUPTLY WINDING RIVER SPRANG INTO SIGHT
AUD0000000145_S0000624 MARGOT WAS FULL OF EXCITEMENT AND PLEASURE AND TALKED INCESSANTLY
AUD0000000145_S0000629 I SAID POINTING
AUD0000000145_S0000635 I LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND SAID WELCOME
AUD0000000145_S0000640 THE SKY WAS VERY CLEAR AND PALE
AUD0000000145_S0000646 ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATION
AUD0000000145_S0000652 THE STONE POTS FULL OF FLOWERS
AUD0000000145_S0000657 DON'T SPEAK TO ME FOR A MOMENT
AUD0000000145_S0000662 AT THE SLOPING ROOF AND THE IRREGULAR CHIMNEY-STACKS
AUD0000000145_S0000668 THOSE VERY FLOWER-POTS
AUD0000000145_S0000673 IS IT NOT IS IT NOT VERY STRANGE
AUD0000000145_S0000678 IT DOES NOT SEEM SO SHE REPLIED
AUD0000000145_S0000683 COME LET US GO IN
AUD0000000145_S0000688 SHE WAS INTENT ON SOMETHING I COULD NOT TELL WHAT
AUD0000000145_S0000693 THIS IS THE DRAWING-ROOM
AUD0000000145_S0000698 SHE SCARCELY LOOKED AT THEM
AUD0000000145_S0000703 I ANSWERED
AUD0000000145_S0000708 AND ALMOST COMPLETELY ALTERED
AUD0000000145_S0000713 THEN SHE WALKED UP TO THE FIREPLACE AND DREW A LONG BREATH
AUD0000000145_S0000719 YES I SEEM TO REMEMBER
AUD0000000145_S0000725 AS I DID ABOUT THE TERRACE
AUD0000000145_S0000730 COME TO YOUR OWN ROOM AND TAKE OFF YOUR THINGS
AUD0000000145_S0000735 IF I COULD BELIEVE SO NOW
AUD0000000145_S0000741 AND MAR-GOT DID NOT AGAIN REFER TO HER CURIOUS SENSATION OF PRE-KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOUSE AND GARDEN
AUD0000000145_S0000746 BUT WE WERE OLD MARRIED FOLK NOW
AUD0000000145_S0000752 STILL I SHOULD HAVE WISHED MARGOT TO DESIRE IT
AUD0000000145_S0000757 AND MADE ME WONDER IF MY WIFE WERE NOT INCLINED TO THAT CURSE OF HIGHLY-STRUNG WOMEN HYSTERIA
AUD0000000145_S0000762 TRAVERSED THE HALL
AUD0000000145_S0000767 WHEN I NOTICED THAT IT STOOD OPEN
AUD0000000145_S0000772 AND WONDERED WHAT SHE WAS DOING
AUD0000000145_S0000777 BUT MERELY AS IF SHE WERE RESTLESS OR ILL AT EASE
AUD0000000145_S0000782 THAT RENDERED ME EXTREMELY DISCOMFORTED YET I WAS QUITE FASCINATED AND ROOTED TO THE GROUND
AUD0000000145_S0000788 I MIGHT HAVE BEEN WATCHING AN ANIMAL
AUD0000000145_S0000793 AND FELT THAT THEY WERE VERY COLD
AUD0000000145_S0000798 I WENT TO MY DRESSING-ROOM
AUD0000000145_S0000803 I COULD UNDERSTAND HOW DEADLY A THING FEAR IS
AUD0000000145_S0000808 I FELT UNABLE TO REPLY SO I GOT UP AND ADMITTED HER
AUD0000000145_S0000813 JUST BECAUSE THE TWILIGHT CAST A PHANTOM ATMOSPHERE AROUND HER
AUD0000000145_S0000818 I ASKED GAILY
AUD0000000145_S0000823 YES
AUD0000000145_S0000828 SHE ANSWERED
AUD0000000145_S0000833 AND SHE TURNED AND LEFT ME
AUD0000000145_S0000838 I AM TIRED OF WRITING
AUD0000000145_S0000848 THAT LIE AWOKE IN ME SUSPICION OF THE CHILD I HAD MARRIED
AUD0000000145_S0000853 IT WAS AS IF SHE TOOK A THIN VEIL IN HER HANDS
AUD0000000145_S0000858 SEEMED TO WITHDRAW ITSELF
AUD0000000145_S0000863 THE CHANGE I MEAN TO IMPLY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE
AUD0000000145_S0000868 AND FILLING THE TINY RUTS TILL DIMINUTIVE HILLS AND VALLEYS ARE ALL ONE SMOOTH SURFACE
AUD0000000145_S0000873 BEHIND THE OLD SWEET SMILE THE OLD FRANK EXPRESSION
AUD0000000145_S0000878 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SET THEM UP AGAIN WITHOUT NOISE AND DUST
AUD0000000145_S0000883 SOUNDLESS BOLTS THAT KEEP OUT THE SOUL BE PUSHED HOME
AUD0000000145_S0000888 YET I COULD NOT SPEAK OF IT
AUD0000000145_S0000893 THAT WAS THE STRANGE PART OF THE MATTER
AUD0000000145_S0000898 IMPULSE FAILED WITHIN HER AND SHE HAD BEEN ALL IMPULSE
AUD0000000145_S0000903 LEST I SHOULD IMPLANT THE SUSPICION THAT MIGHT HASTEN WHAT I FEARED
AUD0000000145_S0000908 EVEN HOW I SHOULD LOOK
AUD0000000145_S0000913 DID SHE
AUD0000000145_S0000918 THIS WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER SIGNAL
AUD0000000145_S0000923 I FELT TOO AT LENGTH
AUD0000000145_S0000928 I BEGAN TO BELIEVE HER EVERY LOOK PREMEDITATED
AUD0000000145_S0000933 FORCED INTO A FEARFUL KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER'S PERSONAL HABITS
AUD0000000145_S0000938 MARGOT AND I WERE NOW OFTEN SILENT WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER
AUD0000000145_S0000943 SAYING TO HER THAT IF IT CONTINUED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS SHE MIGHT CHANCE TO SEE THE FLOODS OUT
AUD0000000145_S0000948 AND APPEARED TO READ BUT ONCE IN GLANCING UP SUDDENLY FROM MY NEWSPAPER
AUD0000000145_S0000954 AND WALKED UNEASILY UP AND DOWN LISTENING TO THE RAIN ON THE WINDOW
AUD0000000145_S0000959 AND STRANGELY ENOUGH
AUD0000000145_S0000964 I LIT A SECOND CIGAR
AUD0000000145_S0000969 SHE WAS SLEEPING IN THE WIDE WHITE BED RATHER UNEASILY
AUD0000000145_S0000974 BUT SLEEP DID NOT COME TO ME
AUD0000000145_S0000980 AND THE RAIN LASHING THE HOUSE IN FURY
AUD0000000145_S0000985 TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF THE MIND WHICH I HAD ONCE UNDERSTOOD SO PERFECTLY
AUD0000000145_S0000991 NO LONGER WATCHFUL ON THE ALERT
AUD0000000145_S0000996 SHE WAS AWAKE THEN
AUD0000000145_S0001001 I LIT THE CANDLE AND LOOKED AT HER
AUD0000000145_S0001006 I BENT LOWER OVER HER
AUD0000000145_S0001011 AN IMPOTENT ANGER SEIZED ME
AUD0000000145_S0001016 I RETURNED TO MY OWN
AUD0000000145_S0001021 WAS IT COMING TO THIS THEN
AUD0000000145_S0001027 HAD KEPT ME THERE
AUD0000000145_S0001032 ALTHOUGH MARGOT HAD SOFTENED ME WONDERFULLY BY HER SOFTNESS
AUD0000000145_S0001037 IF MY LOVE COULD NOT HOLD MARGOT MY STRENGTH SHOULD
AUD0000000145_S0001042 DIED WITHIN ME
AUD0000000145_S0001047 I WALKED INTO THE DARK HALL
AUD0000000145_S0001052 I SEARCHED ABOUT IN THE DARKNESS ON THE HALL TABLE BUT COULD FIND NO LIGHT
AUD0000000145_S0001057 TO REACH MY DRESSING-ROOM I HAD TO PASS THE APARTMENT WHICH HAD BEEN MY GRANDMOTHER'S SITTING-ROOM
AUD0000000145_S0001063 AS IT ALWAYS WAS AT NIGHT-TIME
AUD0000000145_S0001068 A HORRIBLE LOW CRY BROKE UPON MY EARS OUT OF THE DARKNESS
AUD0000000145_S0001073 I ASKED
AUD0000000145_S0001079 I KNEW THAT ON THE WRITING-TABLE THERE WAS A SILVER BOX CONTAINING WAX MATCHES
AUD0000000145_S0001084 THE ROOM WAS VAGUELY ILLUMINATED
AUD0000000145_S0001090 AND FIXED UPON ME WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SUCH INTENSE AND HIDEOUS FEAR IN THEM THAT I ALMOST CRIED OUT
AUD0000000145_S0001095 WHAT IS IT MARGOT
AUD0000000145_S0001100 AS I DID SO A SORT OF SOB BURST FROM HER
AUD0000000145_S0001105 AT LAST SHE SPOKE IN A LOW VOICE
AUD0000000145_S0001110 IT WAS DARK
AUD0000000145_S0001115 AND YOU CRIED OUT WHEN I WAS ONLY IN THE DOORWAY
AUD0000000145_S0001121 OF COURSE SHE SAID
AUD0000000145_S0001126 AND THEIR EXTREME COLDNESS ROUSED ME TO THE REMEMBRANCE THAT SHE WAS UNCLOTHED
AUD0000000145_S0001131 PLACING THE CANDLE ON THE DRESSING-TABLE
AUD0000000145_S0001137 I WAS SELF-ABSORBED
AUD0000000145_S0001142 SO MUCH MIGHT DEPEND UPON OUR MERE WORDS NOW
AUD0000000145_S0001147 THEN SHE ANSWERED NOT LOOKING AT ME
AUD0000000145_S0001152 I KNEW BY HER MANNER THAT SHE WAS NOT TELLING ME THE TRUTH
AUD0000000145_S0001157 WHY DID YOU CRY OUT
AUD0000000145_S0001163 I WAS STRANGELY MOVED
AUD0000000145_S0001168 YOU MUST KNOW THAT
AUD0000000145_S0001173 YOU CANNOT SAY THAT IT IS I
AUD0000000145_S0001178 FOR GOD'S SAKE LET US HAVE NO BARRIERS BETWEEN US
AUD0000000145_S0001183 YOU DID LOVE ME ONCE
AUD0000000145_S0001188 EVER SHOWN A LACK OF SYMPATHY
AUD0000000145_S0001193 SHE INTERRUPTED ME
AUD0000000145_S0001198 BUT THIS NIGHTMARE THIS THING THAT SEEMS SUCH A MADNESS OF THE INTELLECT
AUD0000000145_S0001204 I SAID
AUD0000000145_S0001209 I WILL NOT I WILL NOT
AUD0000000145_S0001214 THE PAROXYSM SEEMED PASSING AWAY
AUD0000000145_S0001219 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND
AUD0000000145_S0001225 OF YOUR CLASP
AUD0000000145_S0001231 OH I AM HURTING YOU
AUD0000000145_S0001236 IT IS MADNESS INDEED BUT WE MAY KILL IT WHEN WE BOTH KNOW IT
AUD0000000145_S0001241 I SAID TRYING TO BE PATIENT AND CALM
AUD0000000145_S0001246 I MAY HAVE BEEN I HAVE BEEN CRUEL IN THE PAST
AUD0000000145_S0001251 BUT
AUD0000000145_S0001256 THEY ARE FOUNDED UPON NOTHING THEY ARE BRED WITHOUT FATHER OR MOTHER THEY ARE HYSTERICAL THEY ARE WICKED
AUD0000000145_S0001261 YOU DARE NOT
AUD0000000145_S0001266 AND I HAVE MARRIED THIS WOMAN
AUD0000000145_S0001271 WE ARE CONTROLLED BY SOMETHING INSIDE OF US THERE ARE POWERS IN US THAT WE CANNOT FIGHT AGAINST
AUD0000000145_S0001276 UNDERSTAND ME MARGOT I LOVE YOU BUT I AM NOT A WEAK FOOL
AUD0000000145_S0001281 HER TONE TURNED ME COLD
AUD0000000145_S0001286 I AM NOT A COWARD BUT I FIND THAT I AM INCLINED TO FEAR THAT WHICH FEARS ME
AUD0000000145_S0001291 THE WHITE FAIR CHILD I HAD MARRIED WAS AT MOMENTS ONLY AT MOMENTS HORRIBLE TO ME
AUD0000000145_S0001296 THAT DREAD RETURNED FROM THE NIGHT OF OUR EXPLANATION
AUD0000000145_S0001301 BUT I THOUGHT A FURTIVE EXPRESSION OF RELIEF STOLE FOR A MOMENT INTO HER FACE
AUD0000000145_S0001307 THE IDEA MADE MY VERY FLESH CREEP
AUD0000000145_S0001312 FOR I AM ONE OF THE OLD-FASHIONED MEN WHO THINK THAT A HUSBAND OUGHT TO BE MASTER OF HIS WIFE AS WELL AS OF HIS HOUSE
AUD0000000145_S0001317 READY TO FALL AT HER FEET AND WORSHIP HER OR TO SEIZE HER AND TREAT HER WITH PHYSICAL VIOLENCE
AUD0000000145_S0001322 THAT HER HORROR OF ME WAS DEEPENING DAY BY DAY
AUD0000000145_S0001327 MOVED TO LEAVE US
AUD0000000145_S0001333 YES MA'AM
AUD0000000145_S0001338 THEN SHE LEANED BACK IN HER CHAIR WITH AN EFFORT AND PRESSED HER LIPS TOGETHER
AUD0000000145_S0001343 USED FOR CUTTING ORANGES
AUD0000000145_S0001348 AND KEPT HER HAND OVER IT ON THE TABLE
AUD0000000145_S0001353 GIVE ME THAT KNIFE
AUD0000000145_S0001359 I SAT SMOKING MY CIGAR IN A TUMULT OF FURIOUS DESPAIR AND LOVE
AUD0000000145_S0001364 THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I WOULD ALMOST HAVE KILLED THE CHILD WHO MYSTERIOUSLY ELUDED AND DEFIED ME
AUD0000000145_S0001369 AND WHEN THE CLOCK CHIMED THE HALF-HOUR AFTER TEN I WENT UPSTAIRS SOFTLY TO HER BEDROOM AND TURNED THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR MEANING TO ENTER
AUD0000000145_S0001374 THE DOOR RESISTED ME IT WAS LOCKED
AUD0000000145_S0001379 WHO IS THERE
AUD0000000145_S0001384 BUT LET ME IN FOR A MOMENT
AUD0000000145_S0001389 GOOD-NIGHT
AUD0000000145_S0001394 MY IMPULSE WAS TO SEIZE MARGOT IN MY ARMS AND CRUSH HER TO DEATH IT MIGHT BE
AUD0000000145_S0001399 NO CANDLES WERE ALIGHT IN IT
AUD0000000145_S0001404 A SUDDEN COLD TOOK HOLD UPON ME
AUD0000000145_S0001410 I COULD HAVE BELIEVED FOR THE MOMENT THAT A WHITE CAT CROUCHED FROM ME THERE BY THE CURTAIN WAITING TO SPRING
AUD0000000145_S0001415 HEAT WAS DEAD I FELT COLD AS STONE
AUD0000000145_S0001420 I COULD HAVE FLED DRIVEN BY THE NAMELESS FEAR THAT WAS UPON ME
AUD0000000145_S0001426 THE FRIENDS TO WHOM WE WENT LORD AND LADY MELCHESTER HAD A LARGE PARTY STAYING WITH THEM
AUD0000000145_S0001431 INNOCENT OF THE COMB
AUD0000000145_S0001436 AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION
AUD0000000145_S0001441 I HARDLY REMEMBER
AUD0000000145_S0001446 A CURIOUSLY EFFEMINATE MAN
AUD0000000145_S0001451 I WOULD AS SOON CONDEMN A TADPOLE FOR NOT BEING A FULL-GROWN FROG
AUD0000000145_S0001456 THERE WOULD BE LESS CENSURE OF INDIVIDUALS IN THIS WORLD HE SAID
AUD0000000145_S0001462 BY PROVIDENCE
AUD0000000145_S0001469 EVEN A MIGHTY POWER MAY CONDESCEND SOMETIMES TO A VERY PRACTICAL JOKE
AUD0000000145_S0001474 DO YOU MEAN THAT SOULS PASS ON INTO THE WORLD AGAIN ON THE DEATH OF THE PARTICULAR BODY IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN FOR THE MOMENT CONFINED
AUD0000000145_S0001479 THE BODY DOES NOT COLOUR THE SOUL OR NOT IN THE SAME DEGREE
AUD0000000145_S0001484 I SOMETIMES DOUBT IT
AUD0000000145_S0001489 DEPEND UPON IT HE HAS TRIED TO BE ORDINARY
AUD0000000145_S0001494 OTHERWISE WHAT WOULD BE THE SENSE OF TALKING ABOUT WEDDED SOULS
AUD0000000145_S0001499 THAT EVEN IN THE ANIMAL WORLD THE SOUL OF ONE ANIMAL PASSES INTO THE BODY OF ANOTHER
AUD0000000145_S0001504 SOULS AS IMMORTAL OR AS MORTAL AS OURS
AUD0000000145_S0001509 INTO HUMAN BEINGS
AUD0000000145_S0001514 HE SAID RATHER FRIGIDLY
AUD0000000145_S0001519 I AM NOT MUCH CONCERNED
AUD0000000145_S0001525 NOW I HAVE MADE A MINUTE STUDY OF CATS
AUD0000000145_S0001530 WILL YOU UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I SAY THAT ALL DOGS ARE MEN
AUD0000000145_S0001535 I SAID LEANING FORWARD WITH MY EYES FIXED UPON HIS KEEN PUCKERED FACE
AUD0000000145_S0001541 EVEN TOWARDS A TOTAL STRANGER BUT IF THAT STRANGER IS ILL DISPOSED TOWARD THEM
AUD0000000145_S0001546 THEY WITHDRAW THE SOUL THAT HAS PEEPED OUT
AUD0000000145_S0001551 THEY ARE SIMPLY ON GUARD WATCHFUL
AUD0000000145_S0001556 A WOMAN INTUITIVELY KNOWS WHO IS HER FRIEND AND WHO IS HER ENEMY SO LONG AT LEAST AS HER HEART IS NOT ENGAGED THEN SHE RUNS WILD I ALLOW
AUD0000000145_S0001561 COLOURED THEIR BODIES IN ACTIONS
AUD0000000145_S0001566 BUT THAT ARE NOW GAINING HUMANITY GRADUALLY
AUD0000000145_S0001571 HE PAUSED AGAIN AND LOOKED AT ME
AUD0000000145_S0001576 BUT THERE IS MUCH TO EXPLAIN
AUD0000000145_S0001582 THAT IS A VERY INTERESTING AND CURIOUS PROBLEM
AUD0000000145_S0001587 OUR INTUITIONS ARE PERHAPS
AUD0000000145_S0001592 INTUITIONS SO CALLED
AUD0000000145_S0001598 CATS BECOME INTENSELY ATTACHED TO LOCALITIES TO CERTAIN SPOTS
AUD0000000145_S0001604 IT WOULD HOWEVER BE ALWAYS UNREASONING HATRED I THINK
AUD0000000145_S0001609 I FELT THAT I WAS PALE TO THE LIPS
AUD0000000145_S0001614 AND ROUND THE BOTTOM OF HER GOWN THERE WAS AN EDGING OF SNOW-WHITE FUR
AUD0000000145_S0001620 BUT SHE IS INTENSELY CAT-LIKE
AUD0000000145_S0001625 HE LOOKED DECIDEDLY TAKEN ABACK
AUD0000000145_S0001631 THE MAN IS MAD I KNOW MAD AS A HATTER ON ONE POINT LIKE SO MANY CLEVER MEN
AUD0000000145_S0001636 THE THEORY IS HIS NOT MINE
AUD0000000145_S0001641 AND I FOUND MYSELF AGREEING WITH THE PROFESSOR TO AN EXTENT THAT MADE ME MARVEL AT MY OWN PREVIOUS BLINDNESS
AUD0000000145_S0001646 WHICH HAD OFTEN STRUCK ME BEFORE
AUD0000000145_S0001651 THE ANIMAL I HAD KILLED
AUD0000000145_S0001657 I HAD EVEN ONCE HAD AN AFFAIR WITH A GIRL WHO WAS ALWAYS CALLED THE SHOT PARTRIDGE
AUD0000000145_S0001664 BUT WITH THE WISH NOT TO SUCCEED
AUD0000000145_S0001669 AND I COULD SCARCELY WITHDRAW MY EYES FROM THE SOFA WHERE MY WIFE WAS SITTING
AUD0000000145_S0001674 AND PRESENTLY IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT HE MIGHT BE IMBUING MARGOT WITH HIS PERNICIOUS DOCTRINES
AUD0000000145_S0001679 I SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR
AUD0000000145_S0001684 THE PROFESSOR LOOKED AT ME IN SURPRISE
AUD0000000145_S0001689 SO YOU ARE A FISHERMAN AS WELL AS A ROMANTIC THEORIST
AUD0000000145_S0001694 SHE ROSE QUIETLY AND BADE THE PROFESSOR GOOD-NIGHT BUT AS SHE GLANCED UP AT ME IN RISING
AUD0000000145_S0001699 I SAID
AUD0000000145_S0001704 YET WITH ALL HIS SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND HIS POWER OF ELICITING FACTS AND ELUCIDATING THEM
AUD0000000145_S0001709 SHE REPLIED
AUD0000000145_S0001714 HE IS EXCEEDINGLY CLEVER
AUD0000000145_S0001719 SHE WAS LOOKING AT ME WITH A CURIOUS STEADY SMILE AN UNWAVERING SMILE THAT CHILLED INSTEAD OF WARMING ME
AUD0000000145_S0001724 DO YOU STILL LOVE ME AS YOU DID
AUD0000000145_S0001729 IT ROUSED A COLD SUSPICION WITHIN ME THAT I WAS CLOSE TO A MASKED BATTERY
AUD0000000145_S0001734 CAN YOU DOUBT IT
AUD0000000145_S0001739 OUR OLD RELATIONS
AUD0000000145_S0001745 WHY
AUD0000000145_S0001750 I FORCED MYSELF TO TOUCH HER LIPS WITH MINE
AUD0000000145_S0001755 I LISTENED
AUD0000000145_S0001764 I FASTENED MY DOOR AND WHEN I WENT TO BED LAY AWAKE FOR HOURS LISTENING
AUD0000000145_S0001769 I KNEW THAT I WAS SHUT UP IN THE HOUSE WITH A SOUL BENT ON UNREASONING VENGEANCE
AUD0000000145_S0001774 MY EYES ARE HEAVY AND MY HEAD ACHES
AUD0000000145_S0001779 THIS PASSIONLESS CHANGE FOR I FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT WARM HUMANITY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TRANSFORMATION TOOK PLACE THREE NIGHTS AGO
AUD0000000145_S0001785 I HAVE TRIED TO ACCOMPLISH THE IMPOSSIBLE
AUD0000000145_S0001790 HAS PASSED INTO THE BODY OF THE WOMAN WHOM I LOVE AND THAT SOUL WHICH ONCE SLEPT IN ITS NEW CAGE
AUD0000000145_S0001795 INTUITION HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF MEMORY
AUD0000000145_S0001800 INSTINCT ONLY WOKE IN MARGOT WHEN I BROUGHT HER TO THE PLACE THE SOUL HAD KNOWN IN THE YEARS WHEN IT LOOKED OUT UPON THE WORLD FROM THE BODY OF AN ANIMAL
AUD0000000145_S0001805 OF THE GRASS BORDERS WHERE THE CAT HAD OFTEN STRETCHED ITSELF IN THE SUN
AUD0000000145_S0001810 THE ANIMAL'S SOUL WITHIN HER NO LONGER MERELY SHRINKS AWAY IN FEAR OF ME
AUD0000000145_S0001815 FORMERLY SHE FEARED ME
AUD0000000145_S0001820 I FEEL THAT IT IS ONLY WAITING THE MOMENT TO SPRING AND THE INHERENT LOVE OF LIFE BREEDS IN ME A PHYSICAL FEAR OF IT AS OF A SUBTLE ENEMY
AUD0000000145_S0001825 AGAINST DEATH
AUD0000000145_S0001830 I AM SICK WITH FEAR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL
AUD0000000145_S0001835 YOUR MIND HAS BEEN FILLED WITH HORRIBLE DREAMS
AUD0000000145_S0001840 THE CLOUD STACKS LAY PILED ABOVE THE SCAWFELL RANGE
AUD0000000145_S0001845 I WENT DOWN TO THE BREAKFAST-ROOM
AUD0000000145_S0001850 HOW CLOSE I CAME TO MY ENEMY AS OUR MOUTHS TOUCHED
AUD0000000145_S0001855 I COULD NOT EAT I COULD ONLY MAKE A PRETENCE OF DOING SO AND MY HAND TREMBLED SO EXCESSIVELY THAT I COULD SCARCELY RAISE MY CUP FROM THE TABLE
AUD0000000145_S0001860 LAST NIGHT
AUD0000000145_S0001866 I HAVE HURT YOU LATELY I KNOW
AUD0000000145_S0001871 AND THE LAST SENTENCE MADE MY BLOOD LITERALLY GO COLD IN MY VEINS
AUD0000000145_S0001876 AND WATCHED THE HORROR AND THE FEAR DAWN IN THEM WITH A MALIGNANT TRIUMPH
AUD0000000145_S0001881 BUT DO NOT PRAY DO NOT BEAR MALICE
AUD0000000145_S0001886 AND TO-NIGHT YOU WILL COME BACK TO ME
AUD0000000145_S0001891 A TERRIBLE SLIGHT SMILE TRAVELLED OVER HER FACE
AUD0000000145_S0001896 IN VAIN I TRIED TO PULL MYSELF TOGETHER
AUD0000000145_S0001901 HE GLANCED TOWARDS ME IN SOME OBVIOUS SURPRISE
AUD0000000145_S0001906 I AM GOING FOR A RIDE IMMEDIATELY
AUD0000000145_S0001911 I MUST WRESTLE WITH MYSELF REGAIN MY COURAGE
AUD0000000145_S0001916 OF THAT WHITE CREATURE AWAITING MY RETURN
AUD0000000145_S0001921 AS MY WEARIED HORSE STUMBLED ALONG THE SHADOWY ROADS
AUD0000000145_S0001926 TO LIE IN THE DARK BY IT
AUD0000000145_S0001931 I HEARD THE SOUND OF THE RIVER
AUD0000000145_S0001936 AT DINNER HER BLUE EYES WATCHED ME
AUD0000000145_S0001941 WHEN I ENTERED HER ROOM
AUD0000000145_S0001946 I THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING DEAR SHE SAID
AUD0000000145_S0001951 HER FACE SEEMED TO ME CARVED IN STONE IT WAS SO RIGID SO EXPRESSIONLESS
AUD0000000145_S0001956 I DON'T FEEL SLEEPY
AUD0000000145_S0001961 HOW ODD YOU ARE TO-NIGHT RONALD
AUD0000000145_S0001966 I BELIEVED SHE MEANT TO SMOTHER ME IN MY SLEEP
AUD0000000145_S0001971 SHE WAS QUITE SILENT AND MOTIONLESS
AUD0000000145_S0001976 SOON AFTER I HAD DONE THIS THERE WAS A STEALTHY MOVEMENT IN THE BED
AUD0000000145_S0001981 WHEN THE LIGHT OF DAWN STOLE IN AT THE WINDOW SHE SEEMED TO BE SLEEPING
AUD0000000145_S0001986 SOON I MUST SLEEP AND THEN
AUD0000000145_S0001991 AND YET
AUD0000000145_S0001996 I WILL TAKE MARGOT AWAY FROM THIS HOUSE THAT HER SOUL REMEMBERS
AUD0000000145_S0002001 I WILL HAVE IT SO
AUD0000000145_S0002006 TO-MORROW
AUD0000000145_S0002011 THE HORROR OF IT
AUD0000000145_S0002016 THE SOUL STARED OUT FROM HER EYES
AUD0000000145_S0002021 AND AS THE BREATH DIED FROM ME AND MY FAILING EYES GAZED AT HER
AUD0000000145_S0002026 THAT BREATH ON MY FACE WAS THE BREATH OF AN ANIMAL
AUD0000000145_S0002031 RONALD ARE YOU NEVER COMING
AUD0000000145_S0002036 JUST AT THE GLIMMER OF DAWN THE FIRST PALE SHAFT OF THE SUN STRUCK ACROSS A BED UPON WHICH LAY THE HUDDLED AND DISTORTED CORPSE OF A MAN
AUD0000000145_S0002041 WATCHING EAGERLY WITH WIDE BLUE EYES THE BIRDS AS THEY DARTED TO AND FRO
AUD0000000145_S0002046 PRESENTLY AN UNWARY SPARROW PERCHED ON THE TRELLIS BENEATH THE WINDOW JUST WITHIN HER REACH
AUD0000000271_S0000006 WAITING ONE ALMOST MIGHT THINK FOR SOME SPLENDID PROCESSION TO PASS HER BOATS AND HER BARGES WITH SCULPTURED STERNS HER FLOWER-LIKE DOORS AND WINDOWS
AUD0000000271_S0000011 OR SPREAD THE LINEN ON FLOWERY LAWNS THAT ARE CUT INTO PATTERNS OF OVAL AND LOZENGE AND ARE MOST AMAZINGLY GREEN
AUD0000000271_S0000016 THERE WERE TWELVE OF THEM
AUD0000000271_S0000021 IN THE ANGLE FORMED BY ONE OF THOSE PLEASANT AND GRACEFUL DUTCH KITCHENS WHOSE EARTHENWARE DRESSER ALL BRIGHT WITH COPPER AND BRASS
AUD0000000271_S0000026 THE HIVES LENT A NEW MEANING TO THE FLOWERS AND THE SILENCE THE BALM OF THE AIR AND THE RAYS OF THE SUN
AUD0000000271_S0000031 WHOSE LOVELIEST HOURS SEEMED TO REJOICE AND TO SING OF THEIR GLADNESS
AUD0000000271_S0000036 WE WILL TAKE A HIVE THAT AWAKES IN THE SPRING AND DULY STARTS ON ITS LABORS AND THEN WE SHALL MEET IN THEIR ORDER ALL THE GREAT EVENTS OF THE BEES
AUD0000000271_S0000041 AND TO SHOW THE LAWS AND HABITS THAT BRING IT ABOUT AND SO WHEN WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE END OF THE BEES' SHORT YEAR WHICH EXTENDS ONLY FROM APRIL TO THE LAST DAYS OF SEPTEMBER
AUD0000000271_S0000047 WHEN FOR THE FIRST TIME WE TAKE THE COVER OFF A HIVE WE CANNOT HELP SOME FEELING OF FEAR
AUD0000000271_S0000052 WHICH PRODUCES SO PECULIAR A PAIN THAT ONE KNOWS NOT WITH WHAT TO COMPARE IT A SORT OF DREADFUL DRYNESS
AUD0000000271_S0000057 THIS WOULD TURN ITSELF IMMEDIATELY INTO A BURNING-BUSH OF HEROISM AND FURY BUT THE SLIGHT AMOUNT OF SKILL NEEDED TO DEAL WITH THE MATTER CAN BE READILY ACQUIRED
AUD0000000271_S0000062 THAT THE BEES RECOGNIZE THEIR OWNER
AUD0000000271_S0000067 TO WHICH THEY WILL DO WELL TO SUBMIT
AUD0000000271_S0000072 A PERSON WHO KNOWS NOTHING OF BEES WILL BE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THE FIRST TIME HE LOOKS INTO A HIVE
AUD0000000271_S0000077 THE BEES THAT LIVE IN THE ONE I HAVE IN MY STUDY IN PARIS ARE ABLE EVEN IN THAT GREAT CITY TO DO THEIR OWN MARKETING AS IT WERE IN OTHER WORDS TO FIND THE FOOD THEY REQUIRE AND TO PROSPER
AUD0000000271_S0000082 ALL HUDDLED UP AGAINST THE GLASS
AUD0000000271_S0000088 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH THEY WERE PRISONERS OR SHALL WE SAY QUEENS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR THRONE
AUD0000000271_S0000093 MUCH IS HAPPENING INSIDE THIS MASS THAT SEEMS SO INACTIVE
AUD0000000271_S0000101 EVEN MORE THAN THE ANT IS ONLY HAPPY WHEN SHE IS IN THE MIDST OF A CROWD SHE CAN ONLY LIVE IN THE CROWD
AUD0000000271_S0000107 SO MUST SHE AT REGULAR INTERVALS
AUD0000000271_S0000112 JUST AS SHE NEEDS THE HONEY ON WHICH SHE LIVES
AUD0000000271_S0000118 THIS HOWEVER HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE
AUD0000000271_S0000123 FROM THESE WE ARRIVE THROUGH ONE STAGE AFTER ANOTHER
AUD0000000271_S0000131 AND OFFERS ENTIRE FREEDOM TO THE BEES
AUD0000000271_S0000137 THEN SPRING COMES UPON THE EARTH
AUD0000000271_S0000142 COMING BACK FROM THE FLOWERS IN THE EVENING
AUD0000000271_S0000148 SHE FEELS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE DONE SOMETHING STRANGE THAT SHE HAS TO DO
AUD0000000271_S0000154 SHE GIVES NO ORDERS SHE OBEYS AS MEEKLY AS THE HUMBLEST OF HER SUBJECTS
AUD0000000271_S0000160 IT IS NOT LIKE THE SPECIAL INSTINCT THAT TEACHES THE BIRD TO BUILD ITS WELL-PLANNED NEST
AUD0000000271_S0000165 OF ALL THIS WINGED PEOPLE AND YET IT ALWAYS ACTS WITH JUDGMENT AND WISDOM
AUD0000000271_S0000170 THAT COMPELS HER TO ALLOW THE YOUNG PRINCESSES TO COME INTO THE WORLD
AUD0000000271_S0000176 THE SPIRIT OF THE HIVE IS PRUDENT AND WISE BUT NEVER NIGGARDLY
AUD0000000271_S0000181 AND THE LADIES OF HONOR WHO WAIT ON THE QUEEN AND NEVER BY ANY CHANCE LET HER OUT OF THEIR SIGHT
AUD0000000271_S0000187 WHO QUESTION ALL COMERS AND GOERS
AUD0000000271_S0000193 WHO HAVE REACHED THE VERY HEIGHT OF PROSPERITY AND POWER SUDDENLY ABANDONING IN FAVOR OF THE GENERATION THAT IS TO FOLLOW
AUD0000000271_S0000199 WE NOTE SOME OF THE BEES' HABITS WE SAY THEY DO THIS AND DO THAT
AUD0000000271_S0000204 WE SEE THE CONSTANT MOVEMENT WITHIN THE HIVE AND WE TELL OURSELVES THAT WE UNDERSTAND ALL ABOUT THEIR LIFE
AUD0000000271_S0000209 HOW MUCH IS DUE TO INTELLIGENCE AND HOW MUCH TO NATURE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS THESE
AUD0000000271_S0000214 SIXTY OR SEVENTY THOUSAND BEES OUT OF THE EIGHTY OR NINETY THOUSAND THAT FORM THE WHOLE POPULATION
AUD0000000271_S0000220 IF THE HIVE WERE POOR OR HAD SUFFERED FROM STORM OR ROBBERY OR IF SOME MISFORTUNE HAD BEFALLEN THE ROYAL FAMILY
AUD0000000271_S0000225 NEVER IS THE HIVE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ON THE EVE OF ITS GREAT SACRIFICE
AUD0000000271_S0000230 EACH ONE SMELLING SO FRESH AND SO SWEET
AUD0000000271_S0000235 IS THE HONEY OF APRIL CLEAREST AND MOST PERFUMED OF ALL
AUD0000000271_S0000240 THAT ARE FANNED ALL THE TIME BY WATCHFUL UNTIRING GUARDIANS
AUD0000000271_S0000247 AND LAST OF ALL IN THE MOST SECRET AND PRIVATE QUARTERS
AUD0000000271_S0000253 THE APPOINTED DAY ARRIVES
AUD0000000271_S0000258 A CARELESS BEE-KEEPER WILL OFTEN SPOIL HIS PEOPLE
AUD0000000271_S0000264 ALL THINGS GO TO PROVE THAT IT IS NOT THE QUEEN BUT THE SPIRIT OF THE HIVE THAT FIXES ON THE HOUR FOR THE SWARM
AUD0000000271_S0000269 SOMETIMES TOO FOR DAY AFTER DAY BEFORE THE ACTUAL SWARMING TAKES PLACE
AUD0000000271_S0000274 OF ALL THIS WE KNOW NOTHING WE DO KNOW THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE HIVE HAS NO DIFFICULTY IN LETTING ITS MESSAGE BE KNOWN TO THE MULTITUDE
AUD0000000271_S0000279 THE JOYOUS WHISPER OF FAIREST SUMMER DAYS THAT THE BEE-KEEPER LOVES SO WELL
AUD0000000271_S0000286 THEY HAVE THEIR SONGS OF ABUNDANCE WHEN THE HARVEST IS PLENTIFUL
AUD0000000271_S0000293 AND HOW EACH ONE IS TOLD PRECISELY THE RIGHT THING TO DO
AUD0000000271_S0000298 THE NEWS TRAVELS QUICKLY FROM GROUP TO GROUP AND FROM THE GUARDS ON THE THRESHOLD TO THE WORKERS ON THE MOST DISTANT COMBS
AUD0000000271_S0000303 IT IS OUR HABIT WHEN WE CONSIDER THE BEES TO SAY THAT ALL THAT WE DO NOT AS YET UNDERSTAND IS JUST DUE TO FATE
AUD0000000271_S0000310 ALL THE RESTLESSNESS CONFUSION THE STIR AND THE WORRY
AUD0000000271_S0000316 SHE WOULD PEACEFULLY CONTINUE HER LABORS WHICH CONSIST IN THE LAYING OF TWO OR THREE THOUSAND EGGS A DAY
AUD0000000271_S0000321 ON THE APPOINTED DAY THEN THE BEAUTIFUL DAY WHOSE DAWN STILL MOIST WITH THE DEW
AUD0000000271_S0000326 OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE GOLDEN CORRIDORS THAT DIVIDE THE WALLS OF THE HIVE
AUD0000000271_S0000333 WHICH VERY POSSIBLY POSSESS SOME SENSE UNKNOWN TO US
AUD0000000271_S0000338 OR THERE MAY BE WIND THEIR WINGS MAY BE FROZEN AND THE FLOWERS REFUSE TO OPEN
AUD0000000271_S0000343 THE QUEEN AND HER CLUSTER OF BEES WOULD NOT DREAM OF RETURNING TO THE SAFETY AND WEALTH OF THE HOME THEY HAD LEFT
AUD0000000271_S0000348 OTHER CREATURES MAY HAVE AN INTELLIGENCE THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM OURS
AUD0000000271_S0000354 WOULD THE MERE SIGHT OF OUR MOVEMENTS OUR BUILDINGS MACHINES AND CANALS
AUD0000000271_S0000359 WHAT ARE THEY AIMING AT WHAT ARE THEY TRYING FOR HE WOULD WONDER AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF PATIENT WATCHING
AUD0000000271_S0000365 AND ALSO BY THEIR BEING GENERALLY FATTER
AUD0000000271_S0000370 THEY APPEAR TO BE HELD IN HIGH HONOR BY ALL WHO COME NEAR THEM AND HAVE NUMBERS OF MEN AND WOMEN TO WAIT ON THEM TO FEED THEM AND LOOK AFTER THEM
AUD0000000271_S0000377 IT IS CERTAIN THAT THIS LABOR MUST BE AN OFFENSE AND ONE WHICH IS PUNISHED
AUD0000000271_S0000383 IN NUMBERS THEY ARE TO THE OTHERS AS A THOUSAND TO ONE
AUD0000000271_S0000389 THAT IS ITS IDEAL THE ONE THING IT LIVES FOR AND WHERE SHALL WE FIND ONE THAT IS MORE SUBLIME WHERE SHALL WE LOOK FOR A SELF-DENIAL THAT IS BRAVER OR MORE COMPLETE
AUD0000000271_S0000395 OH LITTLE CITY SO FULL OF FAITH AND MYSTERY AND HOPE
AUD0000000271_S0000400 THEIR WINGS ARE BROKEN THEIR BODIES SHRIVELED AND COVERED WITH WOUNDS
AUD0000000271_S0000405 TWO OR THREE FLOWERS WILL PROVIDE EACH BEE WITH THE NOURISHMENT THAT SHE REQUIRES
AUD0000000271_S0000411 BUT WE ARE FORGETTING THE HIVE
AUD0000000271_S0000416 BUT MORE PRECIOUS GIFT STILL IS THEIR SUMMONING HIM TO THE GLADNESS OF JUNE
AUD0000000271_S0000423 TO HIM WHO HAS KNOWN THEM AND LOVED THEM
AUD0000000271_S0000429 WITH NO THOUGHT BEYOND HOUSEHOLD CARES
AUD0000000271_S0000434 EXCHANGING WITH THESE THE THREE OR FOUR NECESSARY WORDS OR PERHAPS THEY WILL HAVE HASTENED TO THE GREAT VATS NEAR THE BROOD-CELLS
AUD0000000271_S0000440 ARE ACCUSTOMED TO GATHER AND GOSSIP
AUD0000000271_S0000445 THEY WILL REMAIN TO GUARD THE OLD HOME
AUD0000000271_S0000452 THE ONLY SUNDAY THE BEES EVER KNOW
AUD0000000271_S0000457 THEY CANNOT CONTAIN THE JOY THAT IS IN THEM
AUD0000000271_S0000462 THEY NO LONGER ARE FIERCE SUSPICIOUS ANGRY
AUD0000000271_S0000468 ON WHOM THAT FUTURE DEPENDS
AUD0000000271_S0000475 ON THAT PARTICULAR SPOT IN THE HIVE WHERE HER SPECIAL DUTIES LIE
AUD0000000271_S0000480 IS RUSHING WILDLY TO AND FRO IN BREATHLESS EXCITEMENT
AUD0000000271_S0000485 THERE WOULD SEEM REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE SWARMING ALWAYS TAKES PLACE AGAINST THE WISH OF THE QUEEN
AUD0000000271_S0000490 THE PUREST HONEY IS KEPT FOR HER USE
AUD0000000271_S0000495 THE NEWS WILL SPREAD QUICKLY FROM GROUP TO GROUP
AUD0000000271_S0000501 THE WORKERS WHO WERE BUILDING THE COMB WOULD SCATTER
AUD0000000271_S0000506 WOULD CREEP INTO THE CITY AND THE MISERABLE INHABITANTS WOULD BEFORE LONG ALL DIE OF SORROW AND HUNGER
AUD0000000271_S0000511 THEY RUSH TO OFFER HER HONEY
AUD0000000271_S0000517 WITH THEIR HARVEST OF NECTAR AND POLLEN
AUD0000000271_S0000522 SHOULD A DISASTER FALL ON THE CITY SHOULD THE HIVE OR THE COMB COLLAPSE SHOULD THE BEES SUFFER FROM HUNGER FROM COLD OR DISEASE
AUD0000000271_S0000528 YOU MAY BREAK THEIR COMB TWENTY TIMES IN SUCCESSION
AUD0000000271_S0000536 THAT WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY LARGE TO COVER A COMB OF THREE INCHES SQUARE
AUD0000000271_S0000541 BUT HER WINGS WERE IMPERFECT AND SHE WAS UNABLE TO FLY
AUD0000000271_S0000547 IN THESE BOXES SOME FOOD IS PLACED
AUD0000000271_S0000556 THE QUEEN WAS ALIVE UNHARMED AND FULL OF STRENGTH
AUD0000000271_S0000562 BUT FOR THEIR MOTHER THEY ALWAYS SHOW THE SAME STRONG ATTACHMENT
AUD0000000271_S0000567 AS TO THIS WE HAVE NO CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE BUT BEE-KEEPERS WILL OCCASIONALLY FIND A MAGNIFICENT YOUNG QUEEN PERCHED ON THE CENTRAL COMB OF THE HIVE
AUD0000000271_S0000572 ONE WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THE BEES CONTRIVE TO PROVIDE A SHELTER FOR THEIR POOR OLD QUEEN
AUD0000000271_S0000577 WHAT WOULD THE BEES DO IF WE BY FORCE OR BY SOME TRICK WERE TO BRING A SECOND QUEEN INTO THE CITY
AUD0000000271_S0000582 IF A NEW QUEEN WERE BROUGHT INTO THE HIVE THE BEES WOULD AT ONCE SURROUND HER MAKING A RING WITH THEIR BODIES
AUD0000000271_S0000588 WILL EAGERLY WATCH THE STRANGE DUEL
AUD0000000271_S0000593 THE REIGNING QUEEN WILL ALMOST ALWAYS CONQUER BEING EMBOLDENED AND ENCOURAGED PERHAPS BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE IS FIGHTING IN HER OWN HOME WITH HER SUBJECTS AROUND HER
AUD0000000271_S0000598 IF SHE BE PUT BACK A FEW HOURS LATER
AUD0000000271_S0000603 BUT IF A NEW QUEEN WERE PLACED IN THE HIVE INSTEAD OF THE OLD ONE
AUD0000000271_S0000608 WHICH IS HUNG BETWEEN TWO COMBS
AUD0000000271_S0000613 THERE IS ANOTHER WAY TOO THAT IS USED BY A BEE-MASTER AT ROTTINGDEAN
AUD0000000271_S0000618 HE THEN CAREFULLY RAISES A CORNER OF THE COVER
AUD0000000271_S0000624 IN THIS CASE THEREFORE IT WOULD SEEM THAT HUBER AND THE OTHER EXPERTS WHO DECLARE THAT THE BEES CAN ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN QUEEN
AUD0000000271_S0000629 HER DAUGHTERS WOULD RECEIVE HER SO BADLY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SNATCH HER UP VERY QUICKLY AND TAKE HER AWAY
AUD0000000271_S0000635 AS A CURIOUS INSTANCE
AUD0000000271_S0000640 THEY WILL BUILD A PERFECT WAXEN TOMB ROUND IT
AUD0000000271_S0000645 GENERALLY IN THE CASE OF SNAILS
AUD0000000271_S0000650 IN DISTRICTS WHERE THE HIDEOUS DEATH'S-HEAD MOTH ABOUNDS
AUD0000000271_S0000655 AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH WITH ONE SUDDEN IMPULSE
AUD0000000271_S0000660 WHERE THE THOUSANDS OF BEATING WINGS WEAVE A TISSUE HUMMING WITH SOUND
AUD0000000271_S0000666 AND THEN THERE IS SILENCE ONCE MORE AND IN AN INSTANT THIS MIGHTY TUMULT THIS BEWILDERING GOLDEN HAIL THAT STREAMED UPON EVERY OBJECT NEAR
AUD0000000271_S0000671 AT WHOSE HEAD THE OLD QUEEN IS ALWAYS TO BE FOUND
AUD0000000271_S0000677 OR IF THE BRANCH BE TOO THICK HE CAN PLUNGE A SPOON INTO THE MASS AND LADLE IT OUT PLACING THE LIVING SPOONFULS WHEREVER IT PLEASES HIM
AUD0000000271_S0000682 AND TO BE FULL OF A FAITH AND A CONFIDENCE THAT NOTHING CAN SHAKE
AUD0000000271_S0000689 WHICH IS THEIR METHOD OF CELEBRATING HAPPY EVENTS
AUD0000000271_S0000695 WHICH HAVE ALSO DULY RECORDED THE NEIGHBORING LANDMARKS THE NEW CITY IS FOUNDED AND THE THOUGHT OF IT FILLS THE MIND AND THE HEART OF ALL ITS INHABITANTS THE WALLS RESOUND WITH THE SONG THAT PROCLAIMS THE ROYAL PRESENCE AND WORK BEGINS
AUD0000000271_S0000700 AND GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR MISSION
AUD0000000271_S0000705 AT A GIVEN MOMENT THE ENTIRE MASS STIRS DIVIDES AND SETS FORTH AND THEN IN ONE SUSTAINED AND IMPETUOUS FLIGHT THAT THIS TIME KNOWS NO OBSTACLE
AUD0000000271_S0000712 AND FIRST OF ALL LET US NOT BE UNMINDFUL OF THE SACRIFICE THAT THESE FIFTY THOUSAND WORKERS HAVE MADE
AUD0000000271_S0000720 WHICH IS MORE THAN TWELVE TIMES THE WEIGHT OF ALL THE BEES IN THE HIVE PUT TOGETHER
AUD0000000271_S0000727 THERE IS ONLY THE DREARY EMPTINESS OF AN ENORMOUS BUILDING WITH ITS BARE SIDES AND ROOF
AUD0000000271_S0000732 THE TANGLED MASS DIVIDES
AUD0000000271_S0000738 AND BY SLOW DEGREES THESE CHAINS AS THE NUMBER OF BEES WHICH FORM THEM BECOMES GREATER AND GREATER
AUD0000000271_S0000744 IN THE MEANTIME THE REST OF THE BEES THOSE WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO REMAIN BELOW IN THE HIVE HAVE PAID NOT THE SMALLEST ATTENTION TO THE OTHERS WHO WERE FORMING THE CURTAIN
AUD0000000271_S0000749 EVERY TWIG GRAIN OF SAND AND DEAD LEAF
AUD0000000271_S0000754 WHENCE THEY WILL COME BACK WITH THEIR STORE OF POLLEN
AUD0000000271_S0000759 THEY MUST CONSIDER THE VENTILATION OF THESE DWELLINGS AND THESE TOO MUST BE STRONG AND SUBSTANTIAL
AUD0000000271_S0000765 HIDDEN AWAY BETWEEN MASSES OF SUNFLOWERS PHLOX AND HOLLYHOCK
AUD0000000271_S0000772 TO ACCEPT ALL THESE STRANGE THINGS AS NATURAL
AUD0000000271_S0000778 THE LIKE OF WHICH THE BEE NEVER HAS SEEN AND ALL AROUND IT ARE PUZZLING SIGNS OF THE IMPERTINENT INTERFERENCE OF MAN
AUD0000000271_S0000783 BUT IF NO OBJECTION OF THIS KIND OFFERS ITSELF IN A HUGE FACTORY OF THIS KIND
AUD0000000271_S0000788 BUT WILL BE CAREFUL TO ALTER THE POSITION OF THE CELLS SHOULD THESE NOT FORM AN ABSOLUTELY STRAIGHT LINE
AUD0000000271_S0000797 AND WILL GO ON FLINGING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE GLASS
AUD0000000271_S0000804 IF YOU TAKE UP THE BOTTLE AND TURN IT ROUND AND ROUND
AUD0000000271_S0000810 TO THEM GLASS IS A MYSTERY WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER MET WITH IN NATURE THEY CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE UNABLE TO PASS THROUGH IT
AUD0000000271_S0000815 AS ANOTHER INSTANCE OF THE BEES' LACK OF INTELLIGENCE SIR JOHN LUBBOCK QUOTES A PASSAGE FROM A BOOK WRITTEN BY A GREAT AMERICAN BEE-KEEPER
AUD0000000271_S0000820 PLUNGES IN HEADLONG
AUD0000000271_S0000826 SOME CRAWLING OTHERS FLYING AND SOME SO BEDAUBED THAT THEY COULD NEITHER FLY NOR CRAWL NOT ONE BEE IN TEN ABLE TO CARRY HOME ITS ILL-GOTTEN SPOIL
AUD0000000271_S0000834 IT WAS NOT FOR THEMSELVES THAT THEY PLUNGED INTO THE DEADLY SUGAR THEY CAN ALWAYS FEAST ON HONEY AT HOME IF THEY WANT TO
AUD0000000271_S0000842 A THOUSAND BEES WILL SACRIFICE THEMSELVES TO AVENGE AN INJURY DONE BY A STRANGER TO ONE OF THEIR SISTERS
AUD0000000271_S0000848 WOULD QUIETLY GO ON LICKING UP THE FLUID THAT THEY REGARD AS MORE PRECIOUS THAN LIFE
AUD0000000271_S0000854 BUT THE FACT IS THAT THE BEES DO NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF FEAR
AUD0000000271_S0000859 THIS INDULGENCE HOWEVER THIS MEEKNESS
AUD0000000271_S0000865 BUT WE MUST FRANKLY ADMIT THAT THEY SHOW NO FELLOWSHIP OUTSIDE THE HIVE
AUD0000000271_S0000870 ALL THEIR LOVE GOES TO WHAT LIES AHEAD OF THEM WE GIVE OURS TO WHAT IS AROUND US
AUD0000000271_S0000876 THEY MUST HAVE SOME METHOD OF COMMUNICATION EITHER BY SOUNDS OR BY SOME LANGUAGE OF TOUCH
AUD0000000271_S0000884 AND EACH SEPARATE INCIDENT PRODUCES SUCH A DIFFERENT EMOTION AMONG THEM THE SOUNDS THEY MAKE ARE SO ESSENTIALLY VARIED THAT THE EXPERIENCED BEE-KEEPER LISTENING TO THE MURMUR THAT ARISES FROM THE HIVE
AUD0000000271_S0000889 AS SOON AS SHE HAS FILLED HER SAC SHE WILL GO BUT WATCH HER MANNER OF GOING SHE WILL NOT LIKE THE FLY FOR INSTANCE MERELY BUZZ AROUND OR MAKE A DART FOR THE WINDOW FOR A MOMENT OR TWO SHE WILL HOVER ABOUT THE ROOM
AUD0000000271_S0000894 GOING UNHESITATINGLY TO THE SPOT AND MAKING STRAIGHT FOR THE HONEY
AUD0000000271_S0000899 SOME OF THEM BEING GOSSIPS AND OTHERS NOT GIVEN TO TALK
AUD0000000271_S0000905 AND CAME BACK WITH TWO OF HER SISTERS THESE I IMPRISONED BUT DID NOT INTERFERE WITH HER
AUD0000000271_S0000910 ONE MAY SAFELY SAY THAT THE BEES WILL VERY FREQUENTLY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH THIS IS NOT AN INVARIABLE RULE
AUD0000000271_S0000915 AND THEN PICK UP TWO OR THREE WILD ONES
AUD0000000271_S0000922 AND ALLOWED TO FLY HOME THE DIRECTION OF THEIR FLIGHT WILL BE CAREFULLY NOTED
AUD0000000271_S0000927 HAVING BEEN TOLD BY HER WHERE IT IS
AUD0000000271_S0000933 THEN I WENT TO A GLASS HIVE THAT WAS CLOSE BY THE HOUSE
AUD0000000271_S0000940 AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE HIVE I HAD PLACED A GLASS BOX DIVIDED BY A TRAP-DOOR INTO TWO COMPARTMENTS
AUD0000000271_S0000946 AND TO KEEP HER A PRISONER IN ONE OF THE LITTLE ROOMS
AUD0000000271_S0000951 A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEM WOULD HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY TO MY ROOM
AUD0000000271_S0000957 IN THE HIVE FOR INSTANCE
AUD0000000271_S0000963 IN THE SAME WAY I HAVE FOUND THAT BEES WHICH FOR ONE WHOLE DAY WOULD BE GATHERING NOTHING BUT POLLEN WOULD ON THE NEXT
AUD0000000271_S0000969 THE SAGE AND THE LOTUS ARE ABOUT TO OPEN
AUD0000000271_S0000974 WHILE THREE THOUSAND JUNIORS SALLY FORTH TO THE CLOVER
AUD0000000271_S0000979 AND WHICH FLOWERS THEY ARE TO VISIT THAT THEY ARE AWARE HOW MUCH NECTAR EACH FLOWER WILL GIVE
AUD0000000271_S0000985 THE BEES WILL FLOCK TO THE FLOWERS IN THE WOODS
AUD0000000271_S0000990 FOR ALL THE ABUNDANCE THAT STILL MAY BE FOUND THERE
AUD0000000271_S0000995 IF WE COULD BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT OTHER CREATURES BESIDE OURSELVES ARE ABLE TO THINK OR TO REASON IT WOULD GIVE US SOMETHING OF THE EMOTION THAT CAME OVER ROBINSON CRUSOE WHEN HE SAW THE PRINT OF A HUMAN FOOT ON THE SANDY SHORE OF HIS ISLAND
AUD0000000271_S0001001 A CURIOUS KIND OF SWEAT AS WHITE AS SNOW AND AIRIER THAN THE DOWN ON THE WING OF A BIRD
AUD0000000271_S0001006 WHICH IS ITSELF THE ESSENCE OF THE FLOWERS
AUD0000000271_S0001011 WE KNOW THAT THE HONEY IN THE SAC OF THE BEES THAT ARE CLINGING TO EACH OTHER TURNS ITSELF INTO WAX
AUD0000000271_S0001016 WHEN THE BODIES OF MOST OF THE BEES FORMING THE CURTAIN HAVE THUS BEEN ADORNED WITH IVORY TABLETS
AUD0000000271_S0001021 BANGING AWAY WITH HER HEAD AT THOSE OF HER NEIGHBORS WHO SEEM TO INTERFERE WITH HER MOVEMENTS
AUD0000000271_S0001027 TO THIS BEGINNING SHE WILL ADD OTHER MORSELS OF WAX
AUD0000000271_S0001032 ANOTHER BEE WILL AT ONCE TAKE HER PLACE
AUD0000000271_S0001038 NONE OF THEM FINISHING THE WORK BUT EACH ADDING HER SHARE TO THE TASK IN WHICH ALL COMBINE
AUD0000000271_S0001043 PUTS ON A LITTLE SIDE AS IT WERE AND SHE IS WATCHED VERY CLOSELY BY THE EAGER CROWD BELOW
AUD0000000271_S0001049 IN SHAPE IT WILL BE SOMETHING LIKE OUR OWN TONGUE IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS TO BE MADE UP OF LITTLE SIX-SIDED CELLS
AUD0000000271_S0001055 IT HAPPENS HOWEVER SOMETIMES THAT A MISTAKE HAS BEEN MADE THAT TOO MUCH SPACE OR TOO LITTLE
AUD0000000271_S0001061 THEN THERE ARE ALSO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WHAT ARE KNOWN AS TRANSITION-CELLS
AUD0000000271_S0001066 AND TWO LAYERS OF THESE TUBES FORM THE COMB
AUD0000000271_S0001071 INDEED SUCH WONDERFUL SKILL AND INGENUITY IS SHOWN IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CELLS THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT INSTINCT ALONE IS SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR IT
AUD0000000271_S0001076 THEIR PROVISION-CELLS ARE NOTHING BUT GREAT POTS GROUPED TOGETHER WITHOUT ANY SYSTEM OR ORDER
AUD0000000271_S0001081 WHICH PROVIDE SHORT CUTS IN EVERY DIRECTION
AUD0000000271_S0001086 THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT REASONS FOR DESIRING THIS ALTERATION AN OVERFLOWING HARVEST MAY RENDER MORE STORE-ROOMS NECESSARY
AUD0000000271_S0001092 THE SWARM WHOSE MOVEMENTS WE ARE FOLLOWING HAVE STARTED BUILDING THEIR COMBS
AUD0000000271_S0001097 WHICH WILL PROCEED WITH AMAZING QUICKNESS
AUD0000000271_S0001103 THEIR ENORMOUS BLACK EYES WATCHING HER EVERY MOVEMENT THEY CARESS HER WINGS
AUD0000000271_S0001108 AND THERE IS ONE CURIOUS THING THAT WE MAY NOTE HERE THE WORKER-BEES NEVER BY ANY CHANCE TURN THEIR BACK TO THE QUEEN
AUD0000000271_S0001113 SHE WILL FIRST PEEP INTO THE CELL TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL IS IN ORDER
AUD0000000271_S0001119 WHICH MAY PERHAPS SEEM RATHER DOUBTFUL
AUD0000000271_S0001124 THE BEES WILL CONTRIVE AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN
AUD0000000271_S0001129 THESE WILL BE EMPTY NOW FOR THE LARVAE WILL HAVE COME TO LIFE
AUD0000000271_S0001137 HERE WE FIND AS EVERYWHERE IN LIFE CAUSE AND EFFECT WORKING TOGETHER IN A CIRCLE OF WHICH ONE PART IS ALWAYS IN DARKNESS THE BEES LIKE OURSELVES
AUD0000000271_S0001142 HURRY BUSTLE ACTIVITY THE NURSES INCESSANTLY STIRRING AND DOING
AUD0000000271_S0001148 AND MY FRIEND HIS CURIOSITY SOON SATISFIED
AUD0000000271_S0001155 AMONG OUR OWN PEOPLE THERE ALSO IS SADNESS
AUD0000000271_S0001161 BUT LET OUR REASON BE CONTENT TO ADD SO IT MUST BE
AUD0000000271_S0001169 HAVE DEPARTED FOREVER
AUD0000000271_S0001175 ATTEND TO WHAT IS NECESSARY IN THE HIVE
AUD0000000271_S0001183 AROUND THEM HUNDREDS OF BEES ARE DANCING AND FLAPPING THEIR WINGS
AUD0000000271_S0001192 AND HAS MADE HIS ESCAPE FROM HIS TOMB
AUD0000000271_S0001198 SHE WILL THEN UNDERTAKE HER FIRST FLIGHT KNOWN AS THE CLEANSING-FLIGHT
AUD0000000271_S0001204 THEY HOVER ALOFT IN THE AIR THEIR HEADS TURNED TOWARDS THEIR HOME THEY DESCRIBE GREAT SOARING CIRCLES
AUD0000000271_S0001209 THAT IS HIDDEN PERHAPS BY THE TREES
AUD0000000271_S0001216 DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE APPEAR TO SHOW THAT THIS LATTER IS NOT THE CASE
AUD0000000271_S0001224 OR WILL BE ALTOGETHER LOST
AUD0000000271_S0001229 AND ARE ALWAYS WATCHFUL AND ALERT
AUD0000000271_S0001235 HER LIFE WILL LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS
AUD0000000271_S0001240 NO POCKETS IN WHICH TO SECRETE THE WAX
AUD0000000271_S0001245 WILL BE THE CONSTANT SEARCH FOR CRADLES IN WHICH SHE CAN LAY HER EGGS
AUD0000000271_S0001251 SO AS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR HER TO GET OUT
AUD0000000271_S0001256 WHICH IS KNOWN AS ROYAL JELLY
AUD0000000271_S0001262 AND LEAVE THE MOTHER-CITY TOO EMPTY AT TIMES ALSO THE SWARMS THEMSELVES ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY STRONG
AUD0000000271_S0001267 BUT LET US ASSUME THAT HERE THE SPIRIT OF THE HIVE HAS DECIDED AGAINST A SECOND SWARM
AUD0000000271_S0001272 STRIP OFF THE WAX WITH TEETH AND CLAWS TEAR AWAY THE COCOON AND DART HER STING INTO THE VICTIM WHOM SHE HAS LAID BARE
AUD0000000271_S0001277 AND HAVE NOT INTERFERED THEY HAVE MERELY MOVED OUT OF HER WAY AND HAVE LET HER INDULGE HER FURY AND NO SOONER HAS A CELL BEEN LAID WASTE THAN THEY RUSH TO IT DRAG OUT THE BODY AND GREEDILY LAP UP THE PRECIOUS ROYAL JELLY THAT CLINGS TO THE SIDES OF THE CELL
AUD0000000271_S0001284 AS THE BEES TAKE SPECIAL PAINS TO PREVENT IT
AUD0000000271_S0001290 AND IN KILLING HER WITHOUT RISK TO HERSELF
AUD0000000271_S0001296 THE QUEEN WILL NOT BE DENIED SHE RETURNS AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE CHARGE
AUD0000000271_S0001302 THIS CRY THIS WAR-SONG HAS THE STRANGEST EFFECT ON THE WORKERS
AUD0000000271_S0001307 FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS SOMETIMES EVEN FOR FIVE
AUD0000000271_S0001312 WITH HER ONE DESIRE TO DESTROY THEM
AUD0000000271_S0001317 THEY ARE WELL AWARE THAT IF THE PRINCESSES WERE TO COME OUT OF THEIR LODGING TOO SOON
AUD0000000271_S0001323 SHE ANSWERS THE CHALLENGE FROM WITHIN THE DEPTHS OF HER PRISON
AUD0000000271_S0001328 BUT THIS PERIOD OF WAITING HAS ALSO GIVEN STRENGTH TO THE FIRST-BORN QUEEN
AUD0000000271_S0001335 AT THE HEAD OF THE THIRD SWARM TO BUILD A NEW HOME FAR AWAY
AUD0000000271_S0001340 ALWAYS IN TOUCH WITH THE SECRETS OF NATURE
AUD0000000271_S0001345 AS THE BEES WILL BE AFRAID OF UNDULY IMPOVERISHING THEIR CITY
AUD0000000271_S0001350 WITH THE DIFFERENCE ONLY THAT THE BEES WILL BE FEWER IN NUMBER
AUD0000000271_S0001355 AS A CONSEQUENCE THESE SECOND AND THIRD SWARMS WILL HAVE GREATER DIFFICULTIES TO MEET
AUD0000000271_S0001360 AND THERE IS NOT ONE OF THEM THAT SHRINKS FROM ACCOMPANYING HER ON THE VOYAGE WHERE THERE IS SO MUCH TO LOSE AND SO LITTLE TO GAIN
AUD0000000271_S0001365 WE WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO RELATE THE MANY ADVENTURES THAT THESE DIFFERENT SWARMS WILL ENCOUNTER
AUD0000000271_S0001373 THE WORKERS WILL ENDURE THE PRESENCE OF THE MALES FOR A BRIEF SPACE LONGER
AUD0000000271_S0001378 APPARENTLY NEVER SUSPECTING HOW SCORNFULLY THEY THEMSELVES ARE REGARDED
AUD0000000271_S0001383 AND PROCEED TO SATISFY THEIR APPETITE
AUD0000000271_S0001388 THEY STROLL ALONG VERY PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES
AUD0000000271_S0001393 THEREUPON THEY RETURN TO THE HIVE
AUD0000000271_S0001398 TURN INTO JUDGES AND EXECUTIONERS
AUD0000000271_S0001404 AND RUTHLESSLY TEAR THEM FROM THEIR SLUMBERS
AUD0000000271_S0001409 THEIR FIRST IMPULSE IS TO THE NEAREST FOOD-CELL TO FIND COMFORT AND INSPIRATION THERE
AUD0000000271_S0001415 EACH DRONE IS SEIZED BY THREE OR FOUR MINISTERS OF JUSTICE
AUD0000000271_S0001420 WHO NEVER FOR A MOMENT RELAX THEIR HOLD
AUD0000000271_S0001425 SOME DIE AT ONCE OF THEIR WOUNDS AND ARE DRAGGED AWAY TO DISTANT BURIALGROUNDS OTHERS WHOSE INJURIES ARE LESS SUCCEED IN SHELTERING THEMSELVES IN SOME CORNER WHERE THEY LIE ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER SURROUNDED BY GUARDS TILL THEY PERISH OF HUNGER
AUD0000000271_S0001430 IT WILL OFTEN HAPPEN THAT WHEN SEVERAL HIVES ARE PLACED CLOSE TOGETHER THE MASSACRE OF THE DRONES WILL TAKE PLACE ON THE SAME DAY
AUD0000000271_S0001435 THE AUTUMN HONEY THAT WILL BE NEEDED FOR THE WINTER
AUD0000000271_S0001441 EVERY WELL-CONDUCTED HIVE HAS PRESENTED HIM WITH EIGHTY OR A HUNDRED POUNDS OF HONEY THERE ARE SOME EVEN WHICH WILL HAVE GIVEN TWICE THAT QUANTITY
AUD0000000271_S0001448 THEY HUDDLE TOGETHER ON THE CENTRAL COMB WITH THE QUEEN IN THE MIDST OF THEM ATTENDED BY HER GUARD
AUD0000000271_S0001453 CLINGING ON TO EACH OTHER RISING AND FALLING AS THE CELLS ARE GRADUALLY EMPTIED OF THEIR STORE OF HONEY FOR CONTRARY TO WHAT IS GENERALLY BELIEVED
AUD0000000271_S0001458 AND THEY OWE THIS TO THE HONEY
AUD0000000271_S0001463 AND THIS HONEY THIS ESSENCE OF SUNSHINE AND FLOWERS
AUD0000000271_S0001472 PEOPLE ARE APT TO SAY WHILE ADMITTING THAT IT IS VERY WONDERFUL
AUD0000000271_S0001477 WHERE SHALL WE FIND ANY INSTANCE OF PROGRESS
AUD0000000271_S0001482 THE EARTH CANNOT POSSIBLY TURN THEY WOULD SAY FOR WE CAN SEE THE SUN MOVE IN THE SKY SEE IT RISE IN THE MORNING AND SET IN THE EVENING
AUD0000000271_S0001487 A WELLKNOWN STUDENT OF INSECT LIFE ONCE COVERED THE BARK OF SOME DISEASED TREES WITH A KIND OF CEMENT WHICH HE HAD MADE OUT OF TURPENTINE AND WAX
AUD0000000271_S0001493 CAN NEVER HAVE MET WITH OR KNOWN
AUD0000000271_S0001499 NEED WE WONDER THEN IF OUR KNOWLEDGE IS STILL SOMEWHAT LIMITED
AUD0000000271_S0001505 IT IS OF INTEREST TO COMPARE THE HONEY-BEE OF THE HIVE WITH THE GREAT TRIBE OF APIENS WHICH INCLUDES ALL THE WILD BEES
AUD0000000271_S0001513 BEES DO NOT LIKE OURSELVES DWELL IN TOWNS THAT ARE OPEN TO THE SKY AND EXPOSED TO THE CAPRICE OF RAIN AND STORM
AUD0000000271_S0001519 WITH NO SHELTER OTHER THAN THAT WHICH THE WORKERS' OWN BODIES PROVIDE
AUD0000000271_S0001525 THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO ERECT MORE THAN A SINGLE COMB WHEREAS IF THEY HAVE THE LEAST SHELTER
AUD0000000271_S0001530 AND SEEKING SHELTER IN THE HOLLOW OF A TREE OR A CAVE
AUD0000000271_S0001535 WE HAVE SEEN WITH WHAT SKILL THEY ARE ABLE TO ADAPT A NEW BUILDING TO THEIR REQUIREMENTS
AUD0000000271_S0001540 AND ACTUALLY CONTRIVE TO MEET INTERFERING MAN HALF-WAY
AUD0000000271_S0001546 EACH OF THE HOUSES IN IT IS SO SMALL THAT OUR TWO HANDS CAN COVER IT
AUD0000000271_S0001551 BUT AROUND US THERE IS NOTHING BUT HARDSHIP AND DANGER
AUD0000000271_S0001556 IT BECOMES OUR BUSINESS THEREFORE TO DISENTANGLE THIS CONFUSION
AUD0000000271_S0001562 WHEREAS OUR OWN WILL NEVER REAR MORE THAN TEN OR TWELVE
AUD0000000271_S0001570 SIMILARLY IT IS SAID THAT IN THE BARBADOES
AUD0000000271_S0001576 THIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE INSECT IS TO OUR DOMESTIC BEE MORE OR LESS WHAT A CAVE-DWELLER WOULD BE TO A HIGHLY-CIVILIZED MAN OF TO-DAY
AUD0000000271_S0001581 SHE LEADS A MISERABLE LIFE OF STARVATION AND SOLITUDE
AUD0000000271_S0001586 SHE HAS NO TOOLS TO WORK WITH
AUD0000000271_S0001591 AND THEN HAVING DONE ALL THIS AS BEST SHE CAN SHE GOES OFF AND DIES IN SOME HIDDEN CORNER
AUD0000000271_S0001599 IT WILL BE AN ENEMY OR MORE OFTEN WHAT IS KNOWN AS A PARASITE
AUD0000000271_S0001605 BUT LIVES ON THAT WHICH IS PAINFULLY GOT TOGETHER BY THE UNFORTUNATE BEE ON WHOM IT HAS FASTENED
AUD0000000271_S0001611 THEY HAVE LEARNED THAT THEY MUST DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO THE RACE
AUD0000000271_S0001616 THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION AND NO UNDERSTANDING THEY JOIN TOGETHER IN A COMMON TASK
AUD0000000271_S0001621 THEY BUILD IN THE SAME HAPHAZARD FASHION AS THE OTHERS
AUD0000000271_S0001626 AS THIS INCREASES THEIR MANNERS AND METHODS SOFTEN WHAT WAS FORMERLY A MERE INSTINCT DUE TO THE FEAR OF COLD AND HUNGER
AUD0000000271_S0001631 BEGIN THEIR LIFE IN SOLITUDE
AUD0000000271_S0001638 SHE WILL STORE THE HONEY AND POLLEN THAT SHE COLLECTS
AUD0000000271_S0001645 IF THEY HAVE LAWS THEY DO NOT OBEY THEM THE ELDER BEES WILL AT TIMES DEVOUR THE LARVAE
AUD0000000271_S0001651 ARE NOT WHOLLY IDLE
AUD0000000271_S0001658 IT IS ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND NINETY YEARS AGO THAT PEOPLE FIRST BEGAN TO STUDY THE HABITS OF WILD BEES AT THAT TIME FEW WERE KNOWN
AUD0000000271_S0001665 IT MUST NOT BE IMAGINED THAT THESE REVEAL NO FAULTS
AUD0000000271_S0001671 WE SHOULD HAVE TO OFFER THE HUMBLE COMB OF HONEY
AUD0000000271_S0001679 BUT HERE WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS THE BEE HAS BEEN INTERFERED WITH BY MAN
AUD0000000271_S0001685 IT IS CLEAR THAT THESE FIRST SWARMS AND THEIR COLONIES WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONLY ONES TO SURVIVE THE HARDSHIPS OF WINTER WHICH WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE OTHERS
AUD0000000271_S0001690 THE RESULT WILL PROBABLY HAVE BEEN THAT THE HABIT OF EXCESSIVE SWARMING FASTENED ITSELF ON THE BEES
AUD0000000271_S0001696 AS FOR THE BEES' INTELLIGENCE THEIR POWER OF REASONING
AUD0000000271_S0001702 AND THIS INDUCES US TO LOOK WITH MORE EAGERNESS ON THE THINGS AROUND US
AUD0000000271_S0001708 I HAVE REFERRED TO THE WAY IN WHICH MAN INTERFERES WITH THE BEES AND TRULY THEY DO HERE PROVIDE A MOST ADMIRABLE LESSON
AUD0000000271_S0001714 THAT THEY ARE IN THIS WORLD TO MAKE HONEY AS IT IS WRITTEN IN OUR EYES OUR EARS OUR NERVES IN EVERY LOBE OF OUR BRAIN
AUD0000000271_S0001720 THE ARDOR AND PURITY WITH WHICH OUR SOUL TURNS TO THE LIGHT
AUD0000000309_S0000010 HAD INITIATED IN THE SOUTH
AUD0000000309_S0000015 AS REPRESENTING THE PERSONAL ASPECT OF THE DIVINE NATURE THAT MYSTICAL RELIGION OF LOVE WHICH EVERYWHERE MAKES ITS APPEARANCE AT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SPIRITUAL CULTURE
AUD0000000309_S0000020 RAMANANDA
AUD0000000309_S0000027 AND HAFIZ
AUD0000000309_S0000032 WE MAY SAFELY ASSERT HOWEVER
AUD0000000309_S0000037 IT IS YET SUPREMELY AS A MYSTICAL POET THAT KABIR LIVES FOR US
AUD0000000309_S0000042 BUT HIS WONDERFUL SONGS SURVIVE
AUD0000000309_S0000047 THE MOST OTHERWORLDLY PASSION FOR THE INFINITE
AUD0000000309_S0000052 HE IS AS HE SAYS HIMSELF
AUD0000000309_S0000057 ALL CREDAL DEFINITIONS YET EACH CONTRIBUTED SOMETHING TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THAT INFINITE AND SIMPLE TOTALITY WHO REVEALED HIMSELF
AUD0000000309_S0000062 SOME FROM A MOHAMMEDAN SOURCE AND CLAIM HIM BY TURNS AS A SUFI AND A BRAHMAN SAINT
AUD0000000309_S0000068 IN WHOM THE RELIGIOUS PASSION WAS INNATE
AUD0000000309_S0000073 TROD UPON HIS BODY UNEXPECTEDLY
AUD0000000309_S0000079 IN SPITE OF THE PROTESTS OF ORTHODOX BRAHMANS AND MOHAMMEDANS BOTH EQUALLY ANNOYED BY THIS CONTEMPT OF THEOLOGICAL LANDMARKS HE PERSISTED IN HIS CLAIM THUS EXHIBITING IN ACTION THAT VERY PRINCIPLE OF RELIGIOUS SYNTHESIS WHICH RAMANANDA HAD SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH IN THOUGHT
AUD0000000309_S0000086 THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS SPIRITUAL GENIUS DEVELOPED
AUD0000000309_S0000094 ALL THE LEGENDS AGREE ON THIS POINT THAT KABIR WAS A WEAVER
AUD0000000309_S0000099 BUNYAN THE TINKER
AUD0000000309_S0000104 BUT A MARRIED MAN
AUD0000000309_S0000109 WITH ITS OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOVE AND RENUNCIATION POURING CONTEMPT UPON THE PROFESSIONAL SANCTITY OF THE YOGI
AUD0000000309_S0000115 ALL EXTERNAL OBSERVANCE WHICH WAS AS THOROUGH AND AS INTENSE AS THAT OF THE QUAKERS THEMSELVES COMPLETED SO FAR AS ECCLESIASTICAL OPINION WAS CONCERNED HIS REPUTATION AS A DANGEROUS MAN
AUD0000000309_S0000122 IDOL AND HOLY WATER SCRIPTURES AND PRIESTS WERE DENOUNCED BY THIS INCONVENIENTLY CLEAR-SIGHTED POET AS MERE SUBSTITUTES FOR REALITY DEAD THINGS INTERVENING BETWEEN THE SOUL AND ITS LOVE THE IMAGES ARE ALL LIFELESS THEY CANNOT SPEAK I KNOW FOR I HAVE CRIED ALOUD TO THEM
AUD0000000309_S0000129 BY HER SUDDEN ENCOUNTER WITH THE INITIATE OF A HIGHER LOVE
AUD0000000309_S0000135 WAS TOLERANT OF THE ECCENTRICITIES OF SAINTLY PERSONS BELONGING TO HIS OWN FAITH
AUD0000000309_S0000141 THE CENTRE OF A GROUP OF DISCIPLES CONTINUING IN EXILE THAT LIFE OF APOSTLE AND POET OF LOVE TO WHICH
AUD0000000309_S0000149 AND FOUND IN THE PLACE OF THE CORPSE A HEAP OF FLOWERS HALF OF WHICH WERE BURIED BY THE MOHAMMEDANS AT MAGHAR
AUD0000000309_S0000156 KABIR'S SONGS ARE OF THIS KIND OUT-BIRTHS AT ONCE OF RAPTURE AND OF CHARITY
AUD0000000309_S0000162 BY CONSTANT APPEALS TO NEEDS
AUD0000000309_S0000167 THE MIGRANT BIRD THAT HE DRIVES HOME HIS INTENSE CONVICTION OF THE REALITY OF THE SOUL'S INTERCOURSE WITH THE TRANSCENDENT
AUD0000000309_S0000174 THE WORKS OF THE GREAT SUFIS AND AMONGST THE CHRISTIANS OF JACOPONE DA TODI
AUD0000000309_S0000182 OF THE NATURE OF GOD AND UNLESS WE MAKE SOME ATTEMPT TO GRASP THIS
AUD0000000309_S0000189 THEY HAVE DONE THIS
AUD0000000309_S0000197 BUT THE ONE ACTUALITY
AUD0000000309_S0000202 THE ALL-PERVADING WITHIN WHOM THE WORLDS ARE BEING TOLD LIKE BEADS
AUD0000000309_S0000207 BUT ALL THESE ARE AT BEST PARTIAL ASPECTS OF HIS NATURE
AUD0000000309_S0000216 AS ONE CHRISTIAN MYSTIC HAS IT
AUD0000000309_S0000222 HE IS THE GREAT AFFIRMATION
AUD0000000309_S0000227 THE NEGATIVE PHILOSOPHY WHICH STRIPS FROM THE DIVINE NATURE ALL ITS ATTRIBUTES AND DEFINING HIM ONLY BY THAT WHICH HE IS NOT REDUCES HIM TO AN EMPTINESS IS ABHORRENT TO THIS MOST VITAL OF POETS BRAHMA HE SAYS
AUD0000000309_S0000235 HE ESCAPES THE EXCESSIVE EMOTIONALISM
AUD0000000309_S0000240 HE IS PROTECTED FROM THE SOUL-DESTROYING CONCLUSIONS OF PURE MONISM
AUD0000000309_S0000245 IS SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL WITH GOD AND THE TRUE OBJECT OF EXISTENCE IS THE MAKING PATENT OF THIS LATENT IDENTITY THE REALIZATION WHICH FINDS EXPRESSION IN THE VEDANTIST FORMULA THAT ART THOU
AUD0000000309_S0000251 THIS ETERNAL DISTINCTION
AUD0000000309_S0000258 WHICH IS SO PASSIONATELY AND FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED IN KABIR'S POEMS
AUD0000000309_S0000265 WHOLE OF CREATION IS THE PLAY OF THE ETERNAL LOVER THE LIVING CHANGING GROWING EXPRESSION OF BRAHMA'S LOVE AND JOY
AUD0000000309_S0000273 THOUGH THE ETERNAL AND ABSOLUTE IS EVER PRESENT TO HIS CONSCIOUSNESS
AUD0000000309_S0000281 THAT THE FRUITS OF INTUITION ITSELF ARE INSTINCTIVELY REFERRED TO THEM
AUD0000000309_S0000286 THEY KNOW AN INEFFABLE FRAGRANCE
AUD0000000309_S0000292 THESE PARALLELS BETWEEN SENSE AND SPIRIT MAY PRESENT THEMSELVES TO CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE FORM OF HALLUCINATIONS AS THE LIGHT SEEN BY SUSO
AUD0000000309_S0000299 NOW KABIR
AUD0000000309_S0000304 FELT THE ECSTATIC CONTACT OF REALITY
AUD0000000309_S0000310 AT THE HEART OF THE UNIVERSE WHITE MUSIC IS BLOSSOMING LOVE WEAVES THE MELODY
AUD0000000309_S0000315 THE SOURCE OF ALL MUSIC PLAYS
AUD0000000309_S0000325 BY THE ALERT COMMONSENSE SO OFTEN FOUND IN PERSONS OF REAL MYSTICAL GENIUS
AUD0000000309_S0000333 THE CONCLUSIONS OF PHILOSOPHY
AUD0000000309_S0000340 BRAHMAN AND SUFI
AUD0000000309_S0000345 ALL ARE NEEDED IF HE IS EVER TO SUGGEST THE CHARACTER OF THAT ONE WHOM THE UPANISHAD CALLED THE SUN-COLOURED BEING WHO IS BEYOND THIS DARKNESS AS ALL THE COLOURS OF THE SPECTRUM ARE NEEDED IF WE WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE SIMPLE RICHNESS OF WHITE LIGHT
AUD0000000309_S0000350 THE BIRD OF THE SOUL MAYA

AUD0000000317_S0000271 THAT WAS THE GARDEN OF PARADISE AND THERE STOOD MANY ANGRY ANGELS WITH FLAMING SWORDS PROTECTING IT

AUD0000000341_S0001514 THERE IS A CONTRADICTION AND NATURALLY RETURNING THERE COMES TO BE BOTH SIDES AND THE CENTRE

AUD0000000341_S0001689 THERE IS ALWAYS THAT DISPOSITION AND IN A WAY THERE IS SOME USE IN NOT MENTIONING CHANGING AND IN ESTABLISHING THE TEMPERATURE
AUD0000000341_S0001694 WHY IS THE EXAMPLE WHICH IS MENTIONED NOT SHOWN TO BE THE SAME

AUD0000000341_S0001838 THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE SINGULARITY SHOWS
AUD0000000341_S0001843 ANY TIME THERE IS MUSIC THAT IS TO QUESTION MORE AND MORE AND THERE IS NO POLITENESS
AUD0000000341_S0001849 A CANISTER THAT IS THE REMAINS OF FURNITURE AND A LOOKING-GLASS AND A BED-ROOM AND A LARGER SIZE
AUD0000000341_S0001854 SHOULD IT BE SO THEN CERTAINLY A ROOM IS BIG ENOUGH WHEN IT IS SO EMPTY AND THE CORNERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER

AUD0000000378_S0000258 WE'LL BRING THIS AFFAIR TO A GRAND-STAND FINISH

AUD0000000378_S0000312 HERE'S A BALL TOO GOOD THING TO HAVE A BALL TO PRACTISE WITH
AUD0000000378_S0000317 A BAG OF MARBLES
AUD0000000378_S0000322 AND JIMMIE LET OUT A CHEER THAT WOULD HAVE AROUSED THE ENVY OF A COLLEGE MAN
AUD0000000378_S0000327 WITH A SMALL CHINA TEA-SET THROWN IN

AUD0000000378_S0000375 SOUGHED AND MOANED
AUD0000000378_S0000380 BECAUSE THERE WAS A DECIDED DEMAND FOR THEM IN THE LITERARY MARKET
AUD0000000378_S0000385 AND CRASH WITH MORAL THUNDERBOLTS AIMED AGAINST MALEFACTORS OF GREAT ACHIEVEMENT AND HIGH SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL STANDING
AUD0000000378_S0000391 AND RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS PRESSURE THERE ROSE UP THESE BEASTLY SYMPTOMS OF AN IMPENDING VISITATION
AUD0000000378_S0000397 COME
AUD0000000378_S0000402 THIS IS MY BUSY NIGHT I WENT ON WHEN NOTHING HAPPENED IN RESPONSE TO MY SUMMONS

AUD0000000378_S0000412 VERY PRETTY VERY PRETTY INDEED SAID I
AUD0000000378_S0000418 WHETHER IT WAS THE QUALITY OF MY JEST OR SOME OTHER INWARD PANG DUE TO ITS GYRATORY BEHAVIOR THAT CAUSED IT I KNOW NOT
AUD0000000378_S0000423 INSTEAD OF HOVERING OVER HER HEAD AS USED TO BE THE CORRECT MANNER OF WEARING THESE HARD-WON ADORNMENTS
AUD0000000378_S0000429 AND I DID NOT CARE TO BE SEEN IN THE COMPANY OF SUCH A PEROXIDIZED VISION AS SHE APPEARED TO BE
AUD0000000378_S0000434 BUT

AUD0000000378_S0000445 I AM TOO POOR TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC WITH YOU

AUD0000000378_S0000483 THE WORLD'S A GREEN AND GLADSOME BALL AND LOVE'S THE RULER OF IT ALL
AUD0000000378_S0000488 IS THAT ANY REASON WHY I SHOULD BE SEEN ON A PUBLIC HIGHWAY WITH A LADY-GHOST OF YOUR ESPECIAL KIND
AUD0000000378_S0000493 WILL YOU COME PLEASANTLY AND OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL
AUD0000000378_S0000499 GOOD SHE CRIED HER FACE WREATHING WITH A PLEASANT LITTLE NILE-GREEN SMILE
AUD0000000378_S0000504 AS I HELPED HER ON WITH THE MACKINTOSH AND SAW THAT THE HOOD COVERED EVERY VESTIGE OF THAT AWFUL COIFFURE
AUD0000000378_S0000510 MY FOOTSTEPS HAD GROWN UNWONTEDLY LIGHT
AUD0000000378_S0000515 THIS ISN'T A SLUM CASE
AUD0000000378_S0000520 TO THE UTTER NEGLECT OF THE OFTEN MORE POIGNANT NEEDS OF THE E MERGED
AUD0000000378_S0000525 BUT NOBODY EVER SEEMS TO THINK OF THE SORROWS OF THE STARVING HUNDREDS ON UPPER FIFTH AVENUE

AUD0000000378_S0000535 OFTEN SAID I BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT
AUD0000000378_S0000541 BUT IS THAT ANY REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NEGLECT THE SUFFERERS WHO LIVE IN THESE MARBLE PALACES
AUD0000000378_S0000546 AND I WAS GLAD TO NOTE THAT THE MASSIVE GRILLE DOORS OF WROUGHT IRON WERE HEAVILY BARRED
AUD0000000378_S0000551 AS SHE SEIZED MY HAND IN HER ICY GRIP AND LITERALLY PULLED ME AFTER HER THROUGH THE MARBLE FRONT OF THE DWELLING

AUD0000000378_S0000577 WHILE THE FACE OF MY COMPANION WREATHED WITH AN INDULGENT SMILE
AUD0000000378_S0000582 SOLID SILVER
AUD0000000378_S0000587 DANGER-SIGNALS
AUD0000000378_S0000594 AS SHE SPOKE A DOOR AT THE FAR END OF THE APARTMENT SWUNG GENTLY OPEN AND A LITTLE BOY TIPTOED SOFTLY IN
AUD0000000378_S0000599 THERE WAS ONLY AN UNEMOTIONAL STARE IN HIS EYES AS THEY SWEPT THE AGGREGATION OF CHILDISH TREASURES

AUD0000000378_S0000672 I STARTED A GREAT TALKING-MACHINE STANDING IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM OFF ON A SPIRITED MILITARY MARCH
AUD0000000378_S0000677 WHEN WE HAD GOT THE WHOLE CORPS ARRANGED TO OUR SATISFACTION
AUD0000000378_S0000682 WHY JUST TO TO KEEP

AUD0000000443_S0000029 BANCROFT'S COLOSSAL HISTORY OF THE WEST AND THE WORKS OF SAMUEL L CLEMENS HAVE ALSO BEEN OF VALUE IN COMPILING THE PRESENT BOOK
AUD0000000443_S0000035 IT BROUGHT THE ATLANTIC COAST AND THE PACIFIC SLOPE TEN DAYS NEARER TO EACH OTHER
AUD0000000443_S0000040 WHICH IT PRECEDED NINE YEARS
AUD0000000443_S0000046 FOR MANY MONTHS THE GIGANTIC STRUGGLE THEN IMMINENT HAD BEEN PAINFULLY DISCERNIBLE TO FAR-SEEING MEN
AUD0000000443_S0000052 IT DEMANDED THAT CONGRESS SHOULD PROTECT SLAVERY THROUGHOUT THE DOMAIN OF THE UNITED STATES
AUD0000000443_S0000057 NEITHER IN THEIR OWN LEGISLATURES NOR IN CONGRESS SHOULD THEY TRESPASS UPON THE RIGHT OF THE SOUTH TO REGULATE SLAVERY AS IT BEST SAW FIT
AUD0000000443_S0000063 FOR IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT THE NORTH WHEN ONCE AROUSED
AUD0000000443_S0000068 MASON AND DIXON'S LINE HAD BEEN A LINE OF REAL DIVISION SEPARATING TWO INHERENTLY DISTINCT PORTIONS OF THE COUNTRY
AUD0000000443_S0000074 ALMOST IMPENETRABLE RANGES OF SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS

AUD0000000443_S0000145 NOT ONLY WAS HE ENOUGH OF A STATESMAN TO APPRECIATE THE WORTH OF A FAST MAIL LINE ACROSS THE CONTINENT
AUD0000000443_S0000152 FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THE ATTENTION OF CONGRESS WAS LARGELY TAKEN UP WITH THE ANTI-SLAVERY TROUBLES THAT LED TO SECESSION AND WAR
AUD0000000443_S0000157 AT THAT TIME THERE WERE THREE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED LINES OF MAIL TRAFFIC
AUD0000000443_S0000162 ALMOST FROM A DUE EASTERLY DIRECTION
AUD0000000443_S0000167 IT HAD BEEN RENDERED THE LEAST IMPORTANT

AUD0000000443_S0000696 THE RECORD OF THE SERVICE FULLY JUSTIFIED THIS POLICY
AUD0000000443_S0000701 THESE ANIMALS WERE ABOUT FOURTEEN HANDS HIGH AND AVERAGED LESS THAN NINE HUNDRED POUNDS IN WEIGHT
AUD0000000443_S0000707 WHILE THE BEAST CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE AND SQUEAL
AUD0000000443_S0000712 THE MOCHILA HAD FOUR POCKETS CALLED CANTINAS IN EACH OF ITS CORNERS ONE IN FRONT AND ONE BEHIND EACH OF THE RIDER'S LEGS
AUD0000000443_S0000718 IT HELD A TIME-CARD ON WHICH A RECORD OF THE ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE AT THE VARIOUS STATIONS WHERE IT WAS OPENED WAS KEPT
AUD0000000443_S0000723 THE POSTAL CHARGES WERE AT FIRST FIVE DOLLARS FOR EACH HALF-OUNCE LETTER
AUD0000000443_S0000729 THE LARGE NEWSPAPERS OF NEW YORK BOSTON CHICAGO ST LOUIS AND SAN FRANCISCO WERE AMONG THE BEST CUSTOMERS OF THE SERVICE
AUD0000000443_S0000736 BROUGHT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY LETTERS EACH TRIP FROM CALIFORNIA
AUD0000000443_S0000745 A FEW WERE ADDRESSED TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AUD0000000443_S0000750 NOT TO MENTION THE RENDERING OF INVALUABLE HELP TO THE GOVERNMENT IN RETAINING CALIFORNIA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR
AUD0000000443_S0000756 NOR DID THE COMMERCIAL HOUSES OF THE PACIFIC COAST CITIES APPEAR TO MIND A LITTLE EXPENSE IN FORWARDING THEIR BUSINESS LETTERS
AUD0000000443_S0000762 OF THE EIGHTY RIDERS USUALLY IN THE SERVICE
AUD0000000443_S0000767 YET THERE WERE MANY EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE AS WILL BE SHOWN LATER
AUD0000000443_S0000772 CONSEQUENTLY
AUD0000000443_S0000777 ONE OF THE STATION-KEEPER'S MOST IMPORTANT DUTIES WAS TO HAVE A FRESH HORSE SADDLED AND BRIDLED A HALF HOUR BEFORE THE EXPRESS WAS DUE
AUD0000000443_S0000782 IF IN THE MOUNTAINS
AUD0000000443_S0000787 THE COURIER WOULD ALREADY HAVE LOOSED HIS MOCHILA
AUD0000000443_S0000792 USUALLY FIFTEEN SECONDS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL
AUD0000000443_S0000799 THEY WERE MEN OF A HEROIC AND EVEN IN SOME INSTANCES
AUD0000000443_S0000804 WITH HEADQUARTERS AT THE PLATTE CROSSING NEAR FORT KEARNEY
AUD0000000443_S0000811 THE SCHEDULE WAS AT FIRST FIXED AT TEN DAYS FOR EIGHT MONTHS OF THE YEAR AND TWELVE DAYS DURING THE WINTER SEASON
AUD0000000443_S0000817 OUTLINING AS IT DID THE ATTITUDE OF THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE TOWARD THE PENDING CONFLICT
AUD0000000443_S0000822 TWO OR THREE MILES FROM THE STATIONS
AUD0000000443_S0000827 POUNDING THE DIRT OVER THE PLAINS MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS
AUD0000000443_S0000836 AND PRESIDENT BUCHANAN'S LAST MESSAGE A MONTH LATER WERE CARRIED THROUGH IN EIGHT DAYS
AUD0000000443_S0000842 WHILE THE PONY EXPRESS SERVICE CONTINUED
AUD0000000443_S0000847 SCARCELY NEEDS ASSERTING
AUD0000000443_S0000853 THE RIDER BETWEEN FOLSOM AND SACRAMENTO WAS THROWN
AUD0000000443_S0000858 VOLUNTEERED TO FINISH THE RUN
AUD0000000443_S0000864 AND ALL THAT MET US MANAGED TO STREAK BY IN THE NIGHT AND SO WE HEARD ONLY A WHIZ AND A HAIL
AUD0000000443_S0000869 EVERY NECK IS STRETCHED FURTHER AND EVERY EYE STRAINED WIDER AWAY ACROSS THE ENDLESS DEAD LEVEL OF THE PRAIRIE
AUD0000000443_S0000874 MORE AND MORE SHARPLY DEFINED NEARER AND STILL NEARER
AUD0000000443_S0000879 THAT BUT FOR A FLAKE OF WHITE FOAM LEFT QUIVERING AND PERISHING ON A MAIL SACK AFTER THE VISION HAD FLASHED BY AND DISAPPEARED
AUD0000000443_S0000888 THIS PROPOSED COMMONWEALTH WHEN ONCE ERECTED
AUD0000000443_S0000893 THE EXACT DETAILS OF THIS PLOT ARE OF COURSE IMPOSSIBLE TO SECURE
AUD0000000443_S0000900 AND ALL UNITED STATES PROPERTY
AUD0000000443_S0000905 JOHN B FLOYD
AUD0000000443_S0000912 AND DISTRIBUTED THEM AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST
AUD0000000443_S0000918 UNTIL SECESSION WAS IMMINENT
AUD0000000443_S0000926 AND MADE HIM DUKE OF THE PROVINCE OF SONORA
AUD0000000443_S0000933 HE FURTHER WENT ON TO SHOW THAT THEY HAD THE POWER TO DO IT AND ASSERTED THAT IF THE SOUTHERN STATES WENT OUT OF THE UNION
AUD0000000443_S0000938 OF COURSE THESE REMARKS REACHED THE EARS OF HIS CONSTITUENTS ANYHOW
AUD0000000443_S0000943 SHE SWUNG DEFINITELY AND CONCLUSIVELY INTO THE UNION COLUMN
AUD0000000443_S0000949 ABOUT THREE-EIGHTHS OF THE POPULATION WERE OF SOUTHERN DESCENT AND SOLIDLY UNITED IN SYMPATHY FOR THE CONFEDERATE STATES
AUD0000000443_S0000954 HERE THEN AT THE OUTSET WAS A VIGOROUS AND NOT A SMALL MINORITY WHOSE INFLUENCE WAS GREATLY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THEIR NUMBERS BECAUSE OF THEIR ZEAL AND WHO WOULD HAVE SEIZED THE BALANCE OF POWER UNLESS HELD IN CHECK BY AN AROUSED UNION SENTIMENT AND MILITARY INTIMIDATION
AUD0000000443_S0000959 WOULD INEVITABLY ESPOUSE THE SIDE THAT SEEMED THE MOST LIKELY OF SPEEDY SUCCESS AND IN VIEW OF THE EARLY SUCCESSES OF THE CONFEDERATE ARMIES AND THE ZEALOUS PROSELYTIZING OF REBEL SYMPATHIZERS IN THEIR MIDST THEY WERE A POTENTIAL RISK TO LOYAL CALIFORNIA
AUD0000000443_S0000966 CHIMERICAL AS THIS ARGUMENT MAY SOUND IT HAD MUCH WEIGHT
AUD0000000443_S0000971 YET THEY WERE NOW ASSURED THAT THEY MIGHT REMAIN ON THEIR LANDS FOREVER UNDISTURBED UNDER A REBEL REGIME
AUD0000000443_S0000976 TURNING NOW TO THE FORCES MORAL MILITARY AND POLITICAL
AUD0000000443_S0000981 IT TRUTHFULLY ASSERTED THAT CALIFORNIA'S INFLUENCE IN THE FEDERAL UNION SHOULD BE AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHER STATES TO FOLLOW
AUD0000000443_S0000987 WOULD LIKELY FAIL
AUD0000000443_S0000995 THE WAR DEPARTMENT SENT GENERAL EDWIN A SUMNER TO TAKE COMMAND OF THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC WITH HEADQUARTERS AT SAN FRANCISCO SUPPLANTING GENERAL ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON WHO RESIGNED TO FIGHT FOR THE SOUTH
AUD0000000443_S0001000 HE WAS EVERY INCH A BRAVE SOLDIER WHO DID HIS FIGHTING IN THE OPEN
AUD0000000443_S0001006 THIS FORCE PROVED ENOUGH TO STOP ANY INCIPIENT UPRISINGS IN THAT PART OF THE STATE
AUD0000000443_S0001012 HE IMMEDIATELY SENT A FEDERAL FORCE TO GARRISON FORT CHURCHILL
AUD0000000443_S0001017 IN THE MEANTIME
AUD0000000443_S0001022 WHICH WITH THOSE THAT FOLLOW ARE TYPICAL OF THE CORRESPONDENCE WHICH THE PONY EXPRESS COURIERS WERE NOW RUSHING ACROSS THE CONTINENT TOWARD AND FROM WASHINGTON
AUD0000000443_S0001028 PLEASE DETAIL OFFICERS TO MUSTER THESE TROOPS INTO SERVICE
AUD0000000443_S0001033 IT MUST HAVE BEEN DISHEARTENING TO SUMNER AND THE LOYALISTS TO SEE THIS FORCE ORDERED INTO SERVICE OUTSIDE THE STATE
AUD0000000443_S0001039 THEN CAME WEEKS AND MONTHS OF DELAY AND UNCERTAINTY WHILE THE OVERCAUTIOUS MCCLELLAN SOUGHT TO BUILD UP A NEW MILITARY MACHINE
AUD0000000443_S0001045 IF SUCCESSFUL AT THE POLLS
AUD0000000443_S0001050 THE PRESIDENT ASKED CONGRESS FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN AND WAS VOTED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
AUD0000000443_S0001057 PLEASE ORGANIZE EQUIP AND HAVE MUSTERED INTO SERVICE
AUD0000000443_S0001062 BY TELEGRAPH TO FORT KEARNEY AND THENCE BY PONY EXPRESS AND TELEGRAPH
AUD0000000443_S0001069 SIMON CAMERON SECRETARY OF WAR
AUD0000000443_S0001074 TO ACT NO DOUBT
AUD0000000443_S0001079 A CAMPAIGN OF AGGRESSION WITH WESTERN TROOPS HAD NO DOUBT SEEMED THE BEST MEANS OF DEFENDING CALIFORNIA AND ADJACENT TERRITORY FROM CONFEDERATE ATTACK
AUD0000000443_S0001084 ACCORDINGLY
AUD0000000443_S0001089 THAT THE WAR DEPARTMENT PROBABLY WAS NOT AWARE OF THE REAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN CALIFORNIA
AUD0000000443_S0001094 UNMISTAKABLY INDICATES HIS ENTIRE SYMPATHY AND COOPERATION WITH THOSE PLOTTING TO SEVER CALIFORNIA FROM HER ALLEGIANCE TO THE UNION
AUD0000000443_S0001100 SHOULD THE ANTI-UNIONISTS TRIUMPH
AUD0000000443_S0001105 THE BEST WAY TO CHECK TREASONABLE ACTIVITIES WAS TO CONVINCE TRAITORS OF THEIR HELPLESSNESS
AUD0000000443_S0001111 THE CONTEST TO BE SURE
AUD0000000443_S0001116 SUCH EXPRESSIONS OF DISLOYALTY AS HER SECESSIONISTS CONTINUED TO DISCLOSE
AUD0000000443_S0001122 PROVED A MASTERFUL MAN AND IN EVERY WAY EQUAL TO THE SITUATION
AUD0000000443_S0001127 THEIR EFFORTS WERE DIRECTED MAINLY TO PROTECTING THE OVERLAND MAILS AND GUARDING THE FRONTIER
AUD0000000443_S0001133 OR PROTECTION AGAINST CONFEDERATE INVASION
AUD0000000443_S0001139 IN LESS THAN HALF THE TIME REQUIRED BY THE OLD STAGE COACH
AUD0000000443_S0001144 WHENCE THE PONY BROUGHT THEM TO SACRAMENTO WHERE THEY WERE TELEGRAPHED TO SAN FRANCISCO
AUD0000000443_S0001153 THE MEN AT DRY CREEK STATION HAVE ALL BEEN KILLED AND IT IS THOUGHT THOSE AT ROBERT'S CREEK HAVE MET WITH THE SAME FATE
AUD0000000443_S0001158 THE EXPRESS COULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED ON ITS HIGH PLANE OF EFFICIENCY WITHOUT AN ABUNDANCE OF COOLHEADED HARDENED MEN MEN WHO KNEW NOT FEAR AND WHO WERE EXPERT THOUGH SOMETIMES IN VAIN IN ALL THE WONDERFUL ARTS OF SELF-PRESERVATION PRACTICED ON THE OLD FRONTIER
AUD0000000443_S0001163 TODAY AFTER A LAPSE OF OVER FIFTY YEARS
AUD0000000443_S0001168 SO OFTEN BORE THE MURDEROUS ATTACKS OF INDIANS AND BANDITS
AUD0000000443_S0001174 RIDING FROM THREE TO SEVEN HORSES
AUD0000000443_S0001179 IT WAS CONFRONTING SUCH EMERGENCIES
AUD0000000443_S0001186 WHEN THE WEST-BOUND MESSENGER ARRIVED WITH IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT DISPATCHES TO CALIFORNIA
AUD0000000443_S0001191 BUT HIS SUCCESSOR WHO WOULD HAVE PICKED UP THE POUCH AND STARTED EASTWARD
AUD0000000443_S0001197 AND WAS SOON POUNDING EASTWARD ON HIS RETURN TRIP
AUD0000000443_S0001202 WILLIAM JAMES ALWAYS CALLED BILL JAMES WAS A NATIVE OF VIRGINIA
AUD0000000443_S0001207 HE RODE ONLY SIXTY MILES EACH WAY BUT COVERED HIS ROUND TRIP OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES IN TWELVE HOURS INCLUDING ALL STOPS
AUD0000000443_S0001212 YET BILL NEVER TOOK TIME TO THINK ABOUT DANGER
AUD0000000443_S0001217 HIS SCHEDULE NIGHT RUN THOUGH IT WAS
AUD0000000443_S0001222 BUT THIS NUMBER IN KEEPING WITH THE REVISED POLICY OF THE COMPANY
AUD0000000443_S0001227 HE WAS A NATIVE MISSOURIAN
AUD0000000443_S0001232 WHICH HE COVERED AT AN AVERAGE OF TWELVE AND ONE HALF MILES AN HOUR
AUD0000000443_S0001239 JIM BEATLEY WHOSE REAL NAME WAS FOOTE
AUD0000000443_S0001244 HE TRAVELED FROM SENECA TO BIG SANDY FIFTY MILES AND BACK
AUD0000000443_S0001251 BOULTON'S HORSE GAVE OUT WHEN FIVE MILES FROM THE LATTER STATION
AUD0000000443_S0001256 HAD A PONY RUN BETWEEN FORT KEARNEY AND THIRTY-TWO-MILE CREEK
AUD0000000443_S0001261 MEL GAVE PURSUIT
AUD0000000443_S0001266 SOON TOLD
AUD0000000443_S0001271 FOUND A MAIL AWAITING HIM
AUD0000000443_S0001276 BUT HIS SERVICES TO THE PONY EXPRESS WERE ABOVE REPROACH
AUD0000000443_S0001281 WAS RIDING FROM ROCK CREEK TO ST JOSEPH THEN BACK TO HIS STARTING POINT AND ON TO SENECA
AUD0000000443_S0001288 AND CAME WEST WHEN THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE
AUD0000000443_S0001294 RISING IS SAID TO HAVE MAINTAINED A CONTINUOUS SPEED OF TWENTY MILES AN HOUR WHILE CARRYING IMPORTANT DISPATCHES BETWEEN BIG SANDY AND ROCK CREEK
AUD0000000443_S0001299 JIMMY CLARK RODE BETWEEN VARIOUS STATIONS EAST OF FORT KEARNEY
AUD0000000443_S0001305 WHILE DOCK MADE A GOOD RECORD AS A COURIER
AUD0000000443_S0001313 IT SEEMS THAT WHILE CLIFF WAS ONCE FREIGHTING WITH A SMALL TRAIN OF NINE WAGONS
AUD0000000443_S0001319 J G KELLEY LATER A CITIZEN OF DENVER WAS A VETERAN PONY MAN
AUD0000000443_S0001325 WHILE THE MOSQUITOES SWARMED SO THICKLY UPON THEIR FACES AND HANDS AS TO MAKE THEIR REAL COLOR AND IDENTITY HARD TO DETERMINE
AUD0000000443_S0001331 THE MEN TRAMPED IT ALL DAY WITH THEIR BARE FEET
AUD0000000443_S0001336 TWENTY MILES FROM CARSON LAKE
AUD0000000443_S0001341 AND AS THE LITTLE STATION WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE DISTURBED AREA THERE WAS PLENTY OF EXCITEMENT
AUD0000000443_S0001346 IN THE MORNING MANY TRACKS WERE FOUND ABOUT THE PLACE
AUD0000000443_S0001351 ALTHOUGH GIVEN TENDER CARE
AUD0000000443_S0001358 FOR THE ROAD ZIGZAGGED THROUGH A JUNGLE
AUD0000000443_S0001363 ON HAVING CLEARED THE THICKET HE DREW REIN ON THE TOP OF A HILL AND LOOKING BACK OVER HIS COURSE
AUD0000000443_S0001368 A FEW DAYS LATER TWO UNITED STATES SOLDIERS
AUD0000000443_S0001373 THERE WERE SELDOM MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR MEN IN THE LITTLE STATION AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT KELLEY AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE NOT ALL KILLED
AUD0000000443_S0001378 OF COURSE HE COULD NOT STOP THE MAIL TO SEE WHY HE HAD BEEN SHOT AT
AUD0000000443_S0001385 UNFORTUNATELY
AUD0000000443_S0001393 TO SHOOT FIRST
AUD0000000443_S0001402 NO DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE PONY EXPRESS WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT MENTIONING THE ADVENTURES OF ROBERT HASLAM
AUD0000000443_S0001408 HE STOPPED AT REED'S STATION ON THE CARSON RIVER IN NEVADA
AUD0000000443_S0001414 BUT ON ARRIVING HIS SUCCESSOR
AUD0000000443_S0001422 AND SINCE RICHARDSON WOULD NOT GO ON DUTY
AUD0000000443_S0001427 HE AT FIRST HAD A LONESOME RIDE OF THIRTY-FIVE MILES TO THE SINK OF THE CARSON
AUD0000000443_S0001432 TILL SMITH'S CREEK WAS REACHED WHERE HE WAS RELIEVED BY J G KELLEY
AUD0000000443_S0001437 THE INDIANS HAD BEEN THERE
AUD0000000443_S0001442 HASLAM WATERED HIS STEED AND POUNDED AHEAD WITHOUT REST OR REFRESHMENT
AUD0000000443_S0001447 THE HOWLING OF WOLVES ADDED TO THE DOLEFULNESS OF THE TRIP
AUD0000000443_S0001452 AFTER REPORTING THE OUTRAGE HE HAD JUST SEEN
AUD0000000443_S0001457 THEY FOUND A BADLY FRIGHTENED LOT OF MEN WHO HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY THE INDIANS ONLY A FEW HOURS PREVIOUSLY
AUD0000000443_S0001462 UNTIL THE MARAUDERS WITHDREW FROM THAT VICINITY
AUD0000000443_S0001467 AFTER AN HOUR'S REST
AUD0000000443_S0001472 THE WEST-BOUND MAIL WOULD SOON ARRIVE AND THERE WAS NOBODY TO TAKE HIS REGULAR RUN
AUD0000000443_S0001477 AND WITHIN A VERY FEW HOURS OF REGULAR SCHEDULE TIME ALL THE WAY
AUD0000000443_S0001486 HE SEEMS TO HAVE ENJOYED HORSEBACK RIDING
AUD0000000443_S0001493 THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN OF ALL THE PONY RIDERS IS WILLIAM F CODY USUALLY CALLED BILL
AUD0000000443_S0001498 THE WATER COMING DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS WAS ALWAYS ICY COLD AND THE CURRENT SWIFT DEEP AND TREACHEROUS
AUD0000000443_S0001505 THOUGH THE CURRENT WAS AT TIMES SLOW
AUD0000000443_S0001510 AT JULESBURG HE MET GEORGE CHRISMAN
AUD0000000443_S0001515 IT WAS A SHORT ROUTE ONE OF THE SHORTEST ON THE SYSTEM
AUD0000000443_S0001520 BUT AFTER KEEPING THE RUN SEVERAL WEEKS
AUD0000000443_S0001525 ACTING THROUGH SIMPSON
AUD0000000443_S0001530 THIRTY-SIX MILES WEST OF FORT LARAMIE
AUD0000000443_S0001535 THE SUPERINTENDENT OBSERVING THE LAD'S TENDER YEARS AND FRAIL STATURE
AUD0000000443_S0001541 HAD BEEN KILLED THE NIGHT BEFORE
AUD0000000443_S0001546 CODY RODE SAFELY FROM THREE CROSSINGS TO HIS TERMINAL AND RETURNED WITH THE EASTBOUND MAIL
AUD0000000443_S0001552 BUT THE SUPERIOR SPEED AND ENDURANCE OF HIS STEED SOON TOLD LYING FLAT ON THE ANIMAL'S NECK HE QUICKLY DISTANCED HIS ASSAILANTS AND THUNDERED INTO SWEETWATER
AUD0000000443_S0001558 THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT DRIVE HIS TIRED PONY TWELVE MILES FURTHER TO PLOUTZ STATION WHERE HE GOT A FRESH HORSE
AUD0000000443_S0001564 HE PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH AN EXTRA MOCHILA WHICH HE STUFFED WITH WASTE PAPERS AND PLACED OVER THE SADDLE IN THE REGULAR POSITION
AUD0000000443_S0001569 TWO HIGHWAYMEN STEPPED FROM CONCEALMENT
AUD0000000443_S0001574 IN REPLY TO THIS THEY TOLD CODY THAT THEY WOULD TAKE THEIR OWN CHANCES
AUD0000000443_S0001579 KNOWING THAT TO RESIST MEANT CERTAIN DEATH CODY BEGAN SLOWLY TO UNFASTEN THE DUMMY POUCH
AUD0000000443_S0001584 AND THAT INSTANT THE RIDER ACTED LIKE A FLASH
AUD0000000443_S0001589 KNOCKED HIM DOWN
AUD0000000443_S0001594 THE FOLLOWING IS A PARTIAL LIST SO FAR AS IS KNOWN
AUD0000000443_S0001599 WILLIAM BRINK
AUD0000000443_S0001604 WILLIAM CATES
AUD0000000443_S0001609 MAJOR ELLIS

AUD0000000443_S0001630 JOHNSON RILES
AUD0000000443_S0001635 GEORGE TOWNE
AUD0000000443_S0001640 MANY OF THESE MEN WERE ROUGH AND UNLETTERED
AUD0000000443_S0001645 YET BE IT ALWAYS REMEMBERED
AUD0000000443_S0001656 OF WHICH THE PONY EXPRESS WAS BUT ONE SEEMS PROPER
AUD0000000443_S0001661 AND ALL ARE TODAY FOLLOWED BY IMPORTANT RAILROADS A SPLENDID TESTIMONIAL TO THE ABILITY OF THE PIONEER PATHFINDERS IN SELECTING THE BEST ROUTES
AUD0000000443_S0001670 BY TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT
AUD0000000443_S0001676 IN THE EARLY FIFTIES WHILE THE CALIFORNIA GOLD CRAZE WAS STILL ON
AUD0000000443_S0001685 AND ABOUT SIX WEEKS FOR THE ENTIRE TRIP
AUD0000000443_S0001696 NOT FAR FROM THE UTAH LINE
AUD0000000443_S0001702 JOHNSTON'S ARMY WAS THEN ADVANCING FROM WINTER QUARTERS AT BRIDGER TOWARD THE VALLEY OF GREAT SALT LAKE
AUD0000000443_S0001711 FROM THE MISSOURI TO DENVER
AUD0000000443_S0001718 WHICH HAD BEEN RUN IN TWO SECTIONS
AUD0000000443_S0001725 WHICH VEHICLES WERE SOON TO BE USED ON EVERY OVERLAND ROUTE IN THE WEST
AUD0000000443_S0001731 THE CONTRACTORS COMPLAINED BECAUSE OF HEAVY LOSSES AND SOUGHT RELIEF OF THE POST OFFICE AND WAR DEPARTMENTS
AUD0000000443_S0001742 TO THE CASUAL OBSERVER IT MAY SEEM STRANGE THAT PRACTICALLY ALL THESE LINES OPERATED AT A DISASTROUS LOSS
AUD0000000443_S0001747 FURTHERMORE THE INDIANS WERE ELUSIVE AND HARD TO FIND WHEN SOUGHT BY A CONSIDERABLE FORCE
AUD0000000443_S0001752 OFTEN THEY WAGED SINGLE-HANDED INDIAN CAMPAIGNS OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE
AUD0000000443_S0001757 NOT TO MENTION THE HANDICAP AND EXPENSE WHICH ALL THESE NATURAL OBSTACLES ENTAILED
AUD0000000443_S0001770 DURING WHICH MEN AND ANIMALS SUFFERED TERRIBLY FROM COLD AND HUNGER
AUD0000000443_S0001783 THEY WERE OPERATING OVER A ROUNDABOUT COURSE
AUD0000000443_S0001789 AND THE MAIL WHICH WAS FAR TOO HEAVY FOR THE OVERLAND FACILITIES TO HANDLE AT THAT TIME
AUD0000000443_S0001795 THE WAR AND THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF THE OVERLAND ROUTE MADE STEAMSHIP SERVICE BY WAY OF THE ISTHMUS QUITE OBSOLETE
AUD0000000443_S0001803 FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WEEKLY
AUD0000000443_S0001809 AND MOST OF THEM PROPOSED STARTING FROM ST LOUIS
AUD0000000443_S0001816 THE LINES CONVERGING AT LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS
AUD0000000443_S0001823 WM G FARGO AND HAMILTON SPENCER
AUD0000000443_S0001830 THE OVERLAND MAILS STARTED FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND ST LOUIS ON THE TWENTY-FIVE DAY SCHEDULE WHICH WAS THREE DAYS LESS THAN THAT OF THE WATER ROUTE
AUD0000000443_S0001835 THESE STAGES TO USE THE WEST-BOUND ROUTE AS AN ILLUSTRATION TRAVELED IN AN ELLIPTICAL COURSE THROUGH SPRINGFIELD MISSOURI AND FAYETTEVILLE ARKANSAS
AUD0000000443_S0001840 THEN ON THROUGH SHERMAN FORT CHADBOURNE AND FORT BELKNAP TEXAS
AUD0000000443_S0001846 TRANSFERRING TO THE TEXAS PACIFIC AT FORT WORTH
AUD0000000443_S0001855 ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES BY THE WAY OF FORTS KEARNEY
AUD0000000443_S0001862 IN TRANSFERRING THE BUTTERFIELD LINE FROM THE SOUTHERN TO THE CENTRAL ROUTE
AUD0000000443_S0001867 THIS WAS THE MOST FAMOUS OF ALL THE STAGE ROUTES
AUD0000000443_S0001876 WEST OF SALT LAKE THE NEW OVERLAND LINE ALLOWED
AUD0000000443_S0001885 IN THE MEANTIME GOLD WAS DISCOVERED IN IDAHO AND MONTANA
AUD0000000443_S0001891 WAS STARTED ABOVE THE SMOKY HILL ROUTE FROM TOPEKA AND LEAVENWORTH ACROSS KANSAS TO DENVER
AUD0000000443_S0001896 MR HOLLADAY RECEIVED FROM THE COLORADO TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE A CHARTER FOR THE HOLLADAY OVERLAND MAIL AND EXPRESS COMPANY
AUD0000000443_S0001901 HOLLADAY HAD THE FOLLOWING RATES FOR PASSENGER TRAFFIC IN FORCE
AUD0000000443_S0001915 BESIDES THESE AMOUNTS WHICH COVERED ONLY THE ANIMALS ROLLING STOCK STATIONS
AUD0000000443_S0001922 AND THE TERMINALS OF THE THROUGH ROUTES BECAME MERELY THE TEMPORARY ENDS OF THE FAST GROWING RAILWAY LINES
AUD0000000443_S0001931 AND THEY ALSO TURNED THEIR ENERGIES TO THE RAILWAY EXPRESS BUSINESS IN WHICH CAPACITY THIS GREAT FIRM THE LAST OF THE OLD STAGE COMPANIES
AUD0000000443_S0001942 STRICKEN OUT THE APPROPRIATION FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF THE DAILY STAGE
AUD0000000443_S0001948 TO BE SURE ITS RECEIPTS WERE SOMETIMES HEAVY
AUD0000000443_S0001953 IT WAS THE IRONY OF FATE THAT CONGRESS SHOULD NEVER GIVE ANY DIRECT RELIEF OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE PONY SERVICE
AUD0000000443_S0001958 THE WAR DEPARTMENT DID ISSUE ARMY REVOLVERS AND CARTRIDGES TO THE RIDERS AND THE FEDERAL TROOPS WHEN AVAILABLE COULD ALWAYS BE RELIED UPON TO PROTECT THE LINE
AUD0000000443_S0001964 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
AUD0000000443_S0001970 IT COST LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO BUILD AND EQUIP STATIONS AT INTERVALS OF EVERY TEN OR TWELVE MILES THROUGHOUT THE LONG ROUTE
AUD0000000443_S0001975 HAY GATHERED WHEREVER WILD GRASSES COULD BE FOUND AND CURED
AUD0000000443_S0001980 WHILE THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FURNISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT OR THE LOCAL STATE OR TERRITORIAL MILITIA

AUD0000000443_S0002003 DURING THIS CAMPAIGN THE LOCAL OFFICERS AND EMPLOYES OF THE EXPRESS GAVE VALIANT SERVICE
AUD0000000443_S0002008 AND WHEN THERE WAS ALREADY SO LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT THAT THE LINE WOULD EVER PAY OUT FINANCIALLY
AUD0000000443_S0002013 UNTIL THE TELEGRAPH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DISPENSE WITH THE FLEET PONY RIDER
AUD0000000443_S0002019 THIS CONDENSED STATEMENT SHOWS THE APPROXIMATE DEFICIT WHICH THE BUSINESS INCURRED
AUD0000000444_S0000014 YET IT WERE TO INCUR THE IMPUTATION OF TOO MUCH SUFFICIENCY TO PRETEND TO SUCH A MERIT AS MIGHT ABIDE THE TEST OF YOUR LORDSHIP'S CENSURE
AUD0000000444_S0000020 THEY OUGHT VERY OFTEN TO EXCITE OUR COMPASSION

AUD0000000453_S0000019 SAID CALHOUN
AUD0000000453_S0000024 IT'S BECOME A HABIT
AUD0000000453_S0000031 IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT
AUD0000000453_S0000037 WE'RE LANDING ON TALLIEN THREE
AUD0000000453_S0000043 CALHOUN LOOKED AT A CLOCK AND OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK AGAIN WHEN A TAPED VOICE SAID ABRUPTLY WHEN THE GONG SOUNDS BREAKOUT WILL BE FIVE SECONDS OFF
AUD0000000453_S0000048 NOW THEY WERE READY TO INFORM HIM ABOUT THE NORMAL COSMOS AS SOON AS THE SHIP RETURNED TO IT
AUD0000000453_S0000054 SAID THE LOUD-SPEAKER
AUD0000000453_S0000060 THREE
AUD0000000453_S0000067 THEY WOULD BE PLANETS
AUD0000000453_S0000073 THE CRESCENT WAS TALLIEN THREE
AUD0000000453_S0000078 HE WAS GOING IN AT A HIGH ANGLE TO THE ECLIPTIC SO METEORS AND BITS OF STRAY CELESTIAL TRASH WEREN'T LIKELY TO BE BOTHERSOME
AUD0000000453_S0000084 NATIVE TIMBER COULD BE USED IN BUILDING
AUD0000000453_S0000090 IT HAD BEEN NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE SCAVENGER ORGANISMS FROM ELSEWHERE
AUD0000000453_S0000096 HEALTH STATISTICS
AUD0000000453_S0000101 MED SHIP ESCLIPAS TWENTY CALLING GROUND
AUD0000000453_S0000107 AN INCOMING VOICE SAID SHARPLY CALLING MED SHIP

AUD0000000453_S0000129 CALHOUN RUBBED HIS NOSE REFLECTIVELY WITH HIS FINGER

AUD0000000453_S0000148 BUT THIS IS THE SPACEPORT
AUD0000000453_S0000153 YOU'LL FIND OUT

AUD0000000453_S0000163 EACH WAS ON A TIGHT BEAM WHILE CALHOUN'S CALL WAS BROADCAST
AUD0000000453_S0000168 DON'T LISTEN DON'T
AUD0000000453_S0000173 CALHOUN LISTENED FOR FULLY FIVE MINUTES
AUD0000000453_S0000181 AN UNIDENTIFIED VOICE IS TELLING US AND WE'RE MED SHIP PERSONNEL MURGATROYD WHO WE SHOULD SPEAK TO AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO
AUD0000000453_S0000186 SAID CALHOUN
AUD0000000453_S0000191 THE DISK OF THE PLANET GREW LARGE
AUD0000000453_S0000197 THERE WERE COMETS OF TELESCOPIC SIZE
AUD0000000453_S0000203 SUDDENLY IT CUT OFF
AUD0000000453_S0000210 PRESENTLY HE SAW THE LANDING GRID NEAR THE BIGGEST CITY THAT HALF-MILE-HIGH CAGELIKE WALL OF INTRICATELY BRACED STEEL GIRDERS
AUD0000000453_S0000216 THE CITY LOOKED LIKE A COLORED MAP
AUD0000000453_S0000223 GO AHEAD
AUD0000000453_S0000229 HE FELT THE CUSHIONY FUMBLING MOTIONS AS FORCE FIELDS FROM THE LANDING GRID GROPED FOR THE MED SHIP AND CENTERED IT IN THEIR COMPLEX PATTERN
AUD0000000453_S0000234 THE VOICE FROM THE GROUND SAID MATTER-OF-FACTLY WE THINK EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL WITH THESE PARAS
AUD0000000453_S0000239 SAID THE VOICE
AUD0000000453_S0000245 AND ONE THOUSAND AND FIVE HUNDRED
AUD0000000453_S0000250 IT'LL BE THERE
AUD0000000453_S0000256 THEN HE SAW THE FIRST SIGN OF MOTION
AUD0000000453_S0000261 THE VOICE FROM THE GROUND SAID IT'S SPOTTED
AUD0000000453_S0000266 HE COULD USE HIS EMERGENCY ROCKETS TO DODGE
AUD0000000453_S0000271 THERE WAS AN INTRICATE PATTERN FORMED BY THE SMOKE TRAILS OF ROCKETS RISING AND OTHER ROCKETS FOLLOWING AND SOME TRAILS DODGING AND OTHERS CLOSING IN
AUD0000000453_S0000277 A PURSUING ROCKET CLOSED IN
AUD0000000453_S0000282 THE LAST AT THAT WAS THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WAY UP
AUD0000000453_S0000287 SOME WERE UNIFORMED
AUD0000000453_S0000292 HE INTRODUCED A MAN IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES AS THE PLANETARY MINISTER FOR HEALTH
AUD0000000453_S0000297 THINGS ARE LINED UP FOR YOU BUT THEY'RE BAD
AUD0000000453_S0000302 SAID THE POLICE HEAD GRIMLY
AUD0000000453_S0000308 ITS SIREN SCREAMED AGAIN
AUD0000000453_S0000314 WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS IT'S PARAS BUT CALHOUN STOOD STILL
AUD0000000453_S0000320 BLASTERS RASPED FROM BESIDE HIM
AUD0000000453_S0000325 THERE COULD BE NO MARKSMANSHIP UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS
AUD0000000453_S0000333 THE OTHER STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET AND BEGAN TO RUN TOWARD CALHOUN
AUD0000000453_S0000338 AUTOMATICALLY HE MOVED TOWARD THE OTHER STILL FIGURE TO ACT AS A MEDICAL MAN DOES WHEN SOMEBODY IS HURT
AUD0000000453_S0000344 DEMANDED THE GRID OPERATOR ANGRILY
AUD0000000453_S0000349 THERE WAS SILENCE AS MEN CAME FROM THE SPACEPORT BUILDING
AUD0000000453_S0000354 WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
AUD0000000453_S0000359 IT APPEARS TO BE AN EPIDEMIC OF
AUD0000000453_S0000366 MURGATROYD ECHOED HIS TONE IN AN INDIGNANT
AUD0000000453_S0000372 WOMEN'S CLOTHES WERE SOMETHING ELSE
AUD0000000453_S0000378 HE HAD MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE PRIMITIVE SANITARY VALUE OF FIRE
AUD0000000453_S0000383 SO HERE ON TALLIEN IT SEEMED INEVITABLE THAT INFECTIVE MATERIAL SHOULD BE SPRAYED WITH ANTISEPTICS INSTEAD OF SIMPLY SET ABLAZE
AUD0000000453_S0000388 BEINGS THAT ONCE WERE SANE MEN
AUD0000000453_S0000393 CONTAGION TO OTHER WORLDS
AUD0000000453_S0000398 THREE OTHER GROUND CARS WAITED THERE
AUD0000000453_S0000404 MEDICALLY
AUD0000000453_S0000409 THAT LEAVES EVERYTHING VERY VAGUE INDEED
AUD0000000453_S0000415 YOU MIGHT CALL IT PANDEMIC
AUD0000000453_S0000421 CALHOUN FROWNED
AUD0000000453_S0000426 IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE A DISEASE OUR BEST PHYSICIANS EXAMINED THEM
AUD0000000453_S0000431 SAID THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH
AUD0000000453_S0000436 WHEN IT BECOMES UNCONTROLLABLE THE PATIENT IS MAD
AUD0000000453_S0000441 IT BEGAN TO LOOK LIKE A RESPECTABLE FIGHTING FORCE
AUD0000000453_S0000446 THEY CRAVE THE INCREDIBLE THEY FEED ON THE ABOMINABLE
AUD0000000453_S0000452 IF THEY RECOVER IN HOW LONG IF THEY DIE HOW SOON
AUD0000000453_S0000457 THEY STAY WHAT THEY'VE BECOME
AUD0000000453_S0000465 THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH SAID UNEASILY IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT SOMETHING OUT OF THE JUNGLE CAUSES WHAT'S HAPPENED
AUD0000000453_S0000471 THEY TURN INTO PARAS
AUD0000000453_S0000476 WE DON'T BEGIN TO KNOW ALL THE CREATURES OF THE JUNGLE
AUD0000000453_S0000483 THINGS FROM THE JUNGLE HAD KILLED THEM
AUD0000000453_S0000489 LIKE THE OTHERS THEY WERE FILLED WITH MEN HOLDING BLAST RIFLES
AUD0000000453_S0000494 SAID CALHOUN CAREFULLY
AUD0000000453_S0000501 IT WOULD BE A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS
AUD0000000453_S0000508 THEN ABRUPTLY THE FAST-MOVING CAVALCADE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE CITY AND PLUNGED INTO IT
AUD0000000453_S0000513 THESE WOULD HAVE MADE THE CITY SEEM ONLY INDIVIDUAL
AUD0000000453_S0000518 THAT IMPLIED VIOLENCE UNRESTRAINED
AUD0000000453_S0000523 THEN HIGH-PITCHED YELLINGS CAME FROM ALOFT
AUD0000000453_S0000528 THE HEAD OF THE PLANETARY POLICE STARED GRIMLY AHEAD
AUD0000000453_S0000536 THEY ALSO BURNED RELIGIOUS OFFERINGS TO DIVERS BLOODTHIRSTY DEITIES
AUD0000000453_S0000541 PARAS DON'T WANT YOU HERE
AUD0000000453_S0000547 INFECTED INTO GOVERNMENT CENTER
AUD0000000453_S0000552 THERE WERE FEW HUMAN VAGARIES THOUGH THAT WERE NOT RECORDED IN THE MED SERVICE FILES
AUD0000000453_S0000557 HE SAID
AUD0000000453_S0000562 BUT MOST OF THEM TURNED PARA
AUD0000000453_S0000567 THEY DOUBTLESS MAKE OUT AS PARAS
AUD0000000453_S0000573 THE STREET ENDED
AUD0000000453_S0000578 THE OTHER CARS FILED IN AFTER IT
AUD0000000453_S0000584 EVERYBODY MYSELF INCLUDED HAS TO HAVE A FRESH CERTIFICATE EVERY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
AUD0000000453_S0000589 THERE WERE STRUCTURES WHICH COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE OTHER THAN GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS
AUD0000000453_S0000594 THERE WERE SOME NOT MANY MEN IN SIGHT BUT MOST OF THEM WERE ELDERLY
AUD0000000453_S0000601 AND YOU CONSIDER THAT IT ISN'T EXACTLY AN INFECTION BUT THE RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT'S DONE TO THEM BY SOMETHING
AUD0000000453_S0000606 THINGS GOT AT THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE CLOSE TO THE TRUTH
AUD0000000453_S0000611 CALHOUN FOLLOWED HIM
AUD0000000453_S0000616 THEY WENT A SHORT DISTANCE AND ANOTHER SENTRY STOPPED THEM
AUD0000000453_S0000621 SAID THE MINISTER HEAVILY
AUD0000000453_S0000627 CALHOUN SAID VERY CAREFULLY I WON'T DENY MORE THAN THE JUNGLE
AUD0000000453_S0000633 A MAN PACED UP AND DOWN BEYOND THE GLASS
AUD0000000453_S0000641 FROM ROOMS LIKE THIS MEN HAD FIRST LEARNED THAT SOME TYPES OF BACTERIA OUTSIDE THE HUMAN BODY WERE ESSENTIAL TO HUMAN HEALTH
AUD0000000453_S0000646 THOUGH INAUDIBLY BECAUSE OF THE SHEET OF GLASS
AUD0000000453_S0000653 HE WAS HELPLESS TO STOP IT IF SUCH A THING COULD BE HE WAS IN A PAROXYSM OF YAWNING
AUD0000000453_S0000658 SAID CALHOUN DETACHEDLY
AUD0000000453_S0000663 HE WAS PLUMP
AUD0000000453_S0000668 OF THE INTERSTELLAR MEDICAL SERVICE TO WHICH ALL PROBLEMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH MAY BE REFERRED
AUD0000000453_S0000674 NOW HE IS NEARLY THE LAST
AUD0000000453_S0000679 I AM TIMID
AUD0000000453_S0000684 I CAME HERE
AUD0000000453_S0000690 IT IS HOPELESS FOR POOR PLANETARY DOCTORS LIKE MYSELF BUT NOT OF COURSE FOR A MED SHIP MAN
AUD0000000453_S0000698 SAID THE PLANETARY DOCTOR CONTEMPTUOUSLY
AUD0000000453_S0000706 MADNESS INVOLVES DELUSIONS BUT PARAS ORGANIZE THEMSELVES THEY MAKE PLANS AND TAKE DIFFERENT PARTS IN THEM
AUD0000000453_S0000711 I I CANNOT LISTEN DR LETT I CANNOT WATCH IF YOU INTEND TO DEMONSTRATE
AUD0000000453_S0000717 HE IS AN UNUSUALLY GOOD SPECIMEN FOR STUDY
AUD0000000453_S0000722 HE BUSIED HIMSELF WITH SOMETHING INSIDE
AUD0000000453_S0000728 THE RAT IS USUALLY DEPENDABLE BUT RATS DO NOT THRIVE ON TALLIEN
AUD0000000453_S0000733 THE FLIES THAT PRODUCE MAGGOTS TO DO SUCH GOOD WORK IN REFUSE DISPOSAL
AUD0000000453_S0000741 DR LETT TURNED FROM THE CULTURE OVEN
AUD0000000453_S0000746 HE HELD OUT THE CONTAINER
AUD0000000453_S0000752 YOU HAVE THE STRONG STOMACH A MEDICAL MAN SHOULD HAVE
AUD0000000453_S0000757 SO NORMAL MEN WOULD RATHER DIE THAN BECOME PARAS
AUD0000000453_S0000762 THEY WRITHED
AUD0000000453_S0000767 HE LOOKED AT THE CONTAINER WITH A HORRIBLE LUSTFUL DESIRE
AUD0000000453_S0000772 HE COULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES FROM THE CONTAINER IN THE DOCTOR'S HANDS
AUD0000000453_S0000777 HE PUT THE CONTAINER INSIDE IT
AUD0000000453_S0000782 HE WAS FILLED WITH BEASTLY UNCONTROLLABLE IMPATIENCE
AUD0000000453_S0000787 THE MAN LEAPED UPON IT HE GOBBLED ITS CONTENTS AND CALHOUN WAS NAUSEATED
AUD0000000453_S0000794 IT IS NEW
AUD0000000453_S0000800 NO
AUD0000000453_S0000806 THERE IS NO CHANGE
AUD0000000453_S0000811 DIABETICS REQUIRE INSULIN
AUD0000000453_S0000818 HE WATCHED CALHOUN'S EXPRESSION
AUD0000000453_S0000826 EVEN PREHISTORIC ROMANS ATE DORMICE COOKED IN HONEY
AUD0000000453_S0000832 HE HATED THEM INTOLERABLY
AUD0000000453_S0000837 SAID DR LETT
AUD0000000453_S0000844 THESE ARE NECESSARY TRACE ELEMENTS
AUD0000000453_S0000849 THIS CONDITION APPEARED ONLY SIX MONTHS AGO
AUD0000000453_S0000855 MY VACCINE
AUD0000000453_S0000860 I AM AFRAID YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BE CO-OPERATIVE
AUD0000000453_S0000866 HE ADMITTED
AUD0000000453_S0000872 OF OTHER
AUD0000000453_S0000879 CALHOUN NODDED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE PARA BEHIND THE GLASS WALL
AUD0000000453_S0000884 IN FACT AREN'T YOU THE MONSTROUS CAUSE OF PARAS
AUD0000000453_S0000889 AND DR LETT DID NOT DO ANYTHING REGRETTABLE
AUD0000000453_S0000900 HE SAID UNEASILY I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE PLANETARY PRESIDENT NOW
AUD0000000453_S0000905 BUT THE PRESIDENT IS WAITING TO SEE YOU
AUD0000000453_S0000910 TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DISCUSS WITH HIM
AUD0000000453_S0000915 WILL YOU
AUD0000000453_S0000920 THIS EPIDEMIC
AUD0000000453_S0000925 IT WON'T TAKE LONG
AUD0000000453_S0000930 OUT TO THE OPEN AIR
AUD0000000453_S0000935 TALL BUILDING SURROUNDED THE AREA WHICH ONCE HAD BEEN TRANQUIL AND OPEN TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE PLANET
AUD0000000453_S0000941 SAID CALHOUN DON'T WANT TO GO THERE
AUD0000000453_S0000947 WITH LUCK IT ONLY STUNS
AUD0000000453_S0000952 THE VACCINE HE'S BEEN GIVING TO CERTAIN HIGH OFFICIALS TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST BECOMING PARA IT SATISFIES THE MONSTROUS APPETITE OF PARA WITHOUT REQUIRING THEM TO EAT SCAVENGERS
AUD0000000453_S0000957 HE TRIED TO SPEAK AND COULD NOT
AUD0000000453_S0000963 YOU'RE A PARA TOO
AUD0000000453_S0000968 I WANT TO GET BACK TO MY SHIP AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO WITH THE VACCINE I TOOK FROM DR LETT
AUD0000000453_S0000973 TWO UNIFORMED MEN JUMPED OUT
AUD0000000453_S0000979 IT WHINED INSTEAD OF RASPING BECAUSE OF ITS LOW-POWER SETTING
AUD0000000453_S0000986 SHRILLED MURGATROYD
AUD0000000453_S0000993 BUT CALHOUN WAS OUT OF SIGHT BEFORE THE FIRST OF THEM STIRRED
AUD0000000453_S0000998 MAYBE THEY'D HAVE LET ME HELP THEM
AUD0000000453_S0001003 THE LOW-POWER BLASTER MUST HAVE KEPT HIM STUNNED FOR MINUTES
AUD0000000453_S0001009 HE WAS THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE DURATION OF THE EMERGENCY
AUD0000000453_S0001014 ANYONE WHO DEFIED HIM OR EVEN TRIED TO FLEE WOULD BECOME SOMETHING BOTH MAD AND REPULSIVE BECAUSE SUBJECT TO MONSTROUS AND IRRESISTIBLE APPETITE
AUD0000000453_S0001021 AGAIN HE TURNED A CORNER THRUSTING MURGATROYD DOWN OUT OF SIGHT
AUD0000000453_S0001026 IT WOULD BE MID-AFTERNOON SO SHADOWS WOULD LIE TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE OBJECTS CASTING THEM
AUD0000000453_S0001031 THAT GATE ALONE WOULD BE THE ONE WHERE SOMEONE COULD GO OUT WITH A CHANCE OF BEING UNCHALLENGED
AUD0000000453_S0001038 IT WAS THE MOST DESPERATE OF GAMBLES BUT IT WAS THE ONLY ONE HE COULD MAKE
AUD0000000453_S0001043 THE WAY HE COULD WALK BECAME NARROWED
AUD0000000453_S0001048 NOTHING COULD BE LESS REMARKABLE THAN HIS ARRIVAL IN THE CITY OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT CENTER
AUD0000000453_S0001053 A SECOND MAN TURNED TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH SOMETHING BEHIND HIM
AUD0000000453_S0001059 CERTAINLY DR LETT AND THE PRESIDENT AND THE CABINET MEMBERS WHO WERE PARAS ACTED CONVINCINGLY AS IF THEY WERE NOT
AUD0000000453_S0001064 HE REGARDED THESE ROUGHLY DRESSED MEN WITH SUSPICION
AUD0000000453_S0001069 THE STATEMENT WENT UNCHALLENGED
AUD0000000453_S0001074 SAID THE MAN WITH THE SPRAY
AUD0000000453_S0001081 THERE WAS THE FAINTEST POSSIBLE RESIDUE LIKE A COATING OF IMPALPABLE DUST
AUD0000000453_S0001088 HE ADDED DISINTERESTEDLY
AUD0000000453_S0001093 HIS INWARD SENSATIONS WERE UNBEARABLE BUT HE HAD TO CONTINUE
AUD0000000453_S0001100 HE CAME TO A CORNER AND TURNED IT
AUD0000000453_S0001108 BUT HE KEPT MURGATROYD OUT OF SIGHT REGARDLESS
AUD0000000453_S0001113 THEY WOULD BE
AUD0000000453_S0001118 HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN SPRAYED WITH SOMETHING
AUD0000000453_S0001124 BEFORE HE FORCED HIS THOUGHTS BACK TO THE MED SHIP WHEN IT WAS TWENTY MILES HIGH AND TEN AND FIVE
AUD0000000453_S0001129 A MAN GOT OUT HIS ARMS FULL OF BUNDLES WHICH WOULD BE FOOD
AUD0000000453_S0001134 HE SAID QUIETLY
AUD0000000453_S0001139 HE FLED INTO THE HOUSE
AUD0000000453_S0001144 IT'S NOT
AUD0000000453_S0001149 HE PASSED THROUGH A BUSINESS DISTRICT WITH MANY SMASHED WINDOWS
AUD0000000453_S0001155 CALHOUN DROVE HIS STOLEN CAR ALONG IT
AUD0000000453_S0001161 THEY'D FAILED
AUD0000000453_S0001166 THEN THERE WAS SUNSET
AUD0000000453_S0001171 BUT THEY'D REALLY BELIEVE HIM STILL HIDING SOMEWHERE IN GOVERNMENT CENTER WITH NO HOPE OF ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING BUT HIS OWN DESTRUCTION
AUD0000000453_S0001176 HE LISTENED WITH STRAINING EARS FOR A LONG TIME
AUD0000000453_S0001181 AS HE LOOKED A LIGHTED WINDOW DARKENED FROM SOMEONE MOVING PAST IT INSIDE
AUD0000000453_S0001186 IF HE HAD TO USE IT HE COULDN'T HOPE TO SHOOT ACCURATELY ENOUGH TO STUN AN ANTAGONIST
AUD0000000453_S0001191 THE GRID OPERATOR COULD HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO LIFT IT OUT TO SPACE THROWN AWAY TO NOWHERE OR PUT IN ORBIT UNTIL IT WAS WANTED AGAIN OR
AUD0000000453_S0001196 HE CREPT CLOSE TO THE CONTROL BUILDING
AUD0000000453_S0001201 HE PUSHED A TANK ON WHEELS WITH A HOSE ATTACHED TO IT
AUD0000000453_S0001209 IT WAS A DECONTAMINANT SPRAY CREDITED WITH THE ABILITY TO DESTROY THE CONTAGION THAT MADE PARAS OUT OF MEN
AUD0000000453_S0001216 MURGATROYD FOLLOWED
AUD0000000453_S0001221 QUESTION CAN YOU FIX THE CONTROLS SO NOBODY ELSE CAN USE THE GRID
AUD0000000453_S0001226 CALHOUN TOLD HIM
AUD0000000453_S0001233 GOOD MAN
AUD0000000453_S0001238 HE SAID PLAINTIVELY CHEE
AUD0000000453_S0001244 THERE WAS A HANDKERCHIEF IN CALHOUN'S POCKET
AUD0000000453_S0001249 THE OPERATOR WAS SHOCKED OUT OF HIS DESPAIR
AUD0000000453_S0001255 I'M MED SERVICE MAN I'VE GOT A JOB TO DO WITH WHAT THEY CALL AN EPIDEMIC I NEED A PARA WHO'S WILLING TO BE CURED THAT'S YOU
AUD0000000453_S0001260 A PAUSE
AUD0000000453_S0001266 ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE
AUD0000000453_S0001272 AND TO PROTECT THE REST AGAINST FALLING A VICTIM TO THIS INTOLERABLE DISEASE
AUD0000000453_S0001277 CALHOUN SAID WRYLY UNFORTUNATELY I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS THE PRESIDENT HAS ANNOUNCED THE GOVERNMENT'S ABDICATION IN FAVOR OF DR LETT AND THAT THE PUNISHMENT FOR DISOBEYING LETT IS MADNESS
AUD0000000453_S0001283 THOUGH CALHOUN HADN'T REALIZED IT
AUD0000000453_S0001288 IN SECONDS THEY HAD IT RINGED ABOUT
AUD0000000453_S0001294 SO MED SHIPS ARE NOT EASILY BROKEN INTO
AUD0000000453_S0001299 THEY WENT IN
AUD0000000453_S0001305 BECAUSE DESPITE A BROADCAST BY THE PLANETARY PRESIDENT TERROR OF PARAS WAS TOO WELL-ESTABLISHED TO BE CURED BY AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT
AUD0000000453_S0001311 HE EMPTIED THE POCKETS OF THE GARMENTS HE'D WORN INTO THE CITY
AUD0000000453_S0001319 WHETHER THERE WAS CONTAGION IN THE CONTROL BUILDING OR NOT THE SHIP MUST BE MADE UNUSABLE TO THE MED SHIP MAN
AUD0000000453_S0001325 THEN I WANT TO KNOW YOUR LAST CONTACT WITH SCAVENGERS
AUD0000000453_S0001332 HE'D BEEN EXPOSED TO WHATEVER IT WAS THAT MADE A MAN A PARA
AUD0000000453_S0001339 CALHOUN REMOVED THE COVER FROM THE OTHER
AUD0000000453_S0001344 PUT IT AWAY
AUD0000000453_S0001349 AS HE PUT DOWN THE COVER HE SAID IN AN INDESCRIBABLE TONE IT DOESN'T SMELL AS BAD TO ME AS IT DID
AUD0000000453_S0001355 IT BEGAN TO HUM
AUD0000000453_S0001360 THE SMALL DEVICE HUMMED MORE SHRILLY
AUD0000000453_S0001365 HE LOOKED ONCE AT THE GRID OPERATOR AND THEN LOOKED AWAY
AUD0000000453_S0001370 IT DOESN'T LOOK MUCH LIKE CHROMATOGRAPHY BUT THE PRINCIPLE'S THE SAME
AUD0000000453_S0001377 HE SEPARATED THEM AND PUT THEM IN A VACUUM DRIER
AUD0000000453_S0001382 HE CLEANED THE GARMENTS HE'D JUST REMOVED DRAWING EVERY PARTICLE OF DUST FROM THEM
AUD0000000453_S0001388 THE GRID OPERATOR GROUND HIS TEETH AGAIN
AUD0000000453_S0001393 CALHOUN WORKED CALMLY ENOUGH BUT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HIS INWARDS SEEMED TO KNOT AND CRAMP HIM
AUD0000000453_S0001400 CALLING HEADQUARTERS
AUD0000000453_S0001407 THE ULTIMATE OF BITTERNESS APPEARED ON HIS FACE
AUD0000000453_S0001412 THE FRACTIONATOR TURNED ITSELF OFF AND HE FOCUSED ON AND STUDIED THE SLIDE IT YIELDED
AUD0000000453_S0001421 ANOTHER VOICE FROM THE SPEAKER HEADQUARTERS
AUD0000000453_S0001426 NOT YET
AUD0000000453_S0001431 CALHOUN PUNCHED KEYS ON A VERY SMALL COMPUTER
AUD0000000453_S0001437 PRACTICE THE SELF-CONTROL THAT CITIZENS OWE TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR WORLD I APPEAL TO YOU
AUD0000000453_S0001442 EARLIER HE'D MADE ANOTHER
AUD0000000453_S0001447 IT SEEMED THE MORE UNEARTHLY BECAUSE OF THE THIN MUSIC OF WIND IN THE LANDING GRID'S UPPER LEVELS
AUD0000000453_S0001452 BUT MOST OF THE CITY WAS DARK AND TERRIBLY EMPTY SAVE FOR MOBS OF ALL SIZES BUT ALL RAGING
AUD0000000453_S0001457 SAID THE ROUNDED TONES OF THE PLANETARY PRESIDENT BUT HIS VOICE SHOOK
AUD0000000453_S0001465 MEN NO LONGER CONSIDERED THAT THERE WAS ANY EFFECTIVE LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS THAT WERE POSSIBLE
AUD0000000453_S0001470 CALHOUN SAID
AUD0000000453_S0001476 BUT I'M AFRAID NOT
AUD0000000453_S0001481 TO CONSIDER THAT EVERYTHING THAT CAN HAPPEN DOES
AUD0000000453_S0001486 HE WHIMPERED A LITTLE AND MURGATROYD WAS A VERY CHEERFUL SMALL ANIMAL POSSESSED OF EXUBERANT HEALTH AND A FINE ZEST IN SIMPLY BEING ALIVE
AUD0000000453_S0001492 IT'S BEEN KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME SAID CALHOUN IMPATIENTLY
AUD0000000453_S0001498 RABBITS ON A TERRAN TYPE WORLD
AUD0000000453_S0001503 RATS
AUD0000000453_S0001510 FOREVER
AUD0000000453_S0001515 THE BOOMING VOICE OF THE PLANETARY PRESIDENT WENT ON AND ON AND ON
AUD0000000453_S0001521 NOW IT DOES
AUD0000000453_S0001526 WHAT
AUD0000000453_S0001532 WHO'D WANT TO BE NORMAL AGAIN AND REMEMBER WHEN HE ATE SCAVENGERS
AUD0000000453_S0001538 AND I'LL TAKE IT THAT WAY
AUD0000000453_S0001543 HE HATED VIOLENCE DID MURGATROYD
AUD0000000453_S0001548 IT CUT OFF ABRUPTLY
AUD0000000453_S0001553 I HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH ALL THE POWERS OF THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE I AND I ALONE HAVE ALL THE POWER OVER THE CAUSE OF THE PARA CONDITION
AUD0000000453_S0001558 IN RETURN
AUD0000000453_S0001564 NONPARAS DO NOT FORGET IT
AUD0000000453_S0001570 I BEGIN AT ONCE THE ORGANIZATION OF A NEW SOCIAL SYSTEM IN WHICH PARAS AND NONPARAS MUST CO-OPERATE
AUD0000000453_S0001575 CALHOUN SAID TONELESSLY TURN THAT OFF WILL YOU
AUD0000000453_S0001580 HE WENT TOWARD THE SMALL LOCKED CHEST IN WHICH CALHOUN HAD PUT AWAY THE PLASTIC CONTAINER OF LIVING SCAVENGERS
AUD0000000453_S0001586 SAID CALHOUN COMPLETELY WHITE
AUD0000000453_S0001593 THERE WAS NOBODY WHO COULD DARE OPPOSE HIM
AUD0000000453_S0001598 THEN HE SAW MURGATROYD SNIFFING AT THE CHEST NOW HOLDING THE CONTAINER OF LIVE SCAVENGERS
AUD0000000453_S0001605 HIS LIPS TIGHTENED
AUD0000000453_S0001610 MURGATROYD HAD NO MORE INHERENT RESISTANCE THAN A MAN
AUD0000000453_S0001617 HE WAS INDIGNANT
AUD0000000453_S0001622 HE'D DONE IT OFTEN IN PLAY
AUD0000000453_S0001628 AND ACETIC-ACID RADICALS AND METHYL SUBMOLECULAR GROUPS
AUD0000000453_S0001635 CALHOUN HAD SHOWN IMPATIENCE ALMOST AN UNHEARD-OF THING
AUD0000000453_S0001640 CALHOUN OFTEN PETTED HIM WHEN IMITATING HE PICKED UP SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN DROPPED
AUD0000000453_S0001645 MURGATROYD PICKED UP THE BLASTER
AUD0000000453_S0001651 HE OFFERED THE BLASTER
AUD0000000453_S0001657 IT WENT INTO THE FLOOR
AUD0000000453_S0001662 CALHOUN'S EXPRESSION WAS STARTLED AMAZED
AUD0000000453_S0001667 HE SHOT THE QUESTION AT THE GRID OPERATOR DO YOU SMELL THAT IT'S WOOD SMOKE
AUD0000000453_S0001672 AND I DIDN'T SEE IT
AUD0000000453_S0001678 IT WAS AN ODDITY BECAUSE IT WAS MAKE OF WOOD
AUD0000000453_S0001683 CALHOUN COUGHED
AUD0000000453_S0001688 THIS IS THE STUFF OUR ANCESTORS HAVE BREATHED IN TINY QUANTITIES FOR A HUNDRED THOUSAND GENERATIONS
AUD0000000453_S0001693 LET'S CHECK ON THIS THING
AUD0000000453_S0001699 CALHOUN PETTED HIM
AUD0000000453_S0001705 THERE WAS NO QUESTION BUT THAT HIS NOSE WAS GRIEVOUSLY OFFENDED
AUD0000000453_S0001712 HORRIBLE
AUD0000000453_S0001717 WE CAN'T GET CO-OPERATION FORM THEM
AUD0000000453_S0001722 CALHOUN GRINNED ALMOST HYSTERICALLY
AUD0000000453_S0001727 HE GOT THEM
AUD0000000453_S0001732 VOICES CAME IN THERE'S FIGHTING EVERYWHERE NORMALS WON'T ACCEPT PARAS AMONG THEM PARAS WON'T LEAVE NORMALS ALONE
AUD0000000453_S0001741 CALHOUN LOOKED AT THE VISION PLATES SHOWING OUTSIDE
AUD0000000453_S0001746 NOW WE END THE PLAGUE ON TALLIEN THREE
AUD0000000453_S0001752 EMERGENCY ROCKETS
AUD0000000453_S0001758 THE EMERGENCY ROCKET BELLOWED THUNDEROUSLY AND THE LITTLE MED SHIP ROSE
AUD0000000453_S0001766 HER EMERGENCY ROCKETS MADE THIN PENCILS OF FLAME TWO HUNDRED FEET LONG
AUD0000000453_S0001772 IT WASN'T A GREAT FIRE CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
AUD0000000453_S0001781 BUT GRATITUDE TO CALHOUN WOULD REMIND THEM
AUD0000000453_S0001786 CHEE
AUD0000000453_S0001791 IF THIS ABNORMAL APPETITE DEVELOPS TOO FAR YOU MIGHT START YAWNING AT ME WHICH WOULD IMPLY THAT YOUR DESIRE FOR IT WAS UNCONTROLLABLE
AUD0000000453_S0001797 SAID CALHOUN
AUD0000000453_S0001802 THERE'S NO WAY TO IMAGINE A PUNISHMENT THAT WOULD REALLY FIT
AUD0000000453_S0001809 SAID CALHOUN
AUD0000000453_S0001814 CALHOUN REFILLED IT
AUD0000000468_S0000009 NOR DID ALICE THINK IT SO VERY MUCH OUT OF THE WAY TO HEAR THE RABBIT SAY TO ITSELF DEAR DEAR I SHALL BE TOO LATE
AUD0000000468_S0000021 BUT I SHALL HAVE TO ASK THEM WHAT THE NAME OF THE COUNTRY IS YOU KNOW
AUD0000000468_S0000028 OH DEAR DINAH I WISH I HAD YOU HERE
AUD0000000468_S0000034 AND SOMETIMES
AUD0000000468_S0000039 AND HAD JUST BEGUN TO DREAM THAT SHE WAS WALKING HAND IN HAND WITH DINAH
AUD0000000468_S0000046 AND JUMPED ON TO HER FEET DIRECTLY SHE LOOKED UP BUT IT WAS ALL DARK OVERHEAD BEFORE HER WAS ANOTHER LONG PASSAGE
AUD0000000468_S0000051 SHE TURNED THE CORNER AFTER IT
AUD0000000468_S0000057 WONDERING HOW SHE WAS EVER TO GET OUT AGAIN SUDDENLY SHE CAME UPON A LITTLE THREE-LEGGED TABLE
AUD0000000468_S0000063 SHE CAME TO A LOW CURTAIN
AUD0000000468_S0000068 HOW SHE LONGED TO GET OUT OF THAT DARK HALL
AUD0000000468_S0000073 OH HOW I WISH I COULD SHUT UP LIKE A TELESCOPE
AUD0000000468_S0000079 SO SHE WENT BACK TO THE TABLE
AUD0000000468_S0000088 IT GENERALLY BLEEDS
AUD0000000468_S0000095 SHE VERY SOON FINISHED IT OFF
AUD0000000468_S0000100 FIRST HOWEVER SHE WAITED FOR A FEW MINUTES TO SEE WHETHER SHE WAS GOING TO SHRINK ANY FURTHER SHE FELT A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS
AUD0000000468_S0000106 HOWEVER NOTHING MORE HAPPENED SO SHE DECIDED ON GOING INTO THE GARDEN AT ONCE
AUD0000000468_S0000111 SHE FOUND SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY REACH IT SHE COULD SEE IT PLAINLY ENOUGH THROUGH THE GLASS
AUD0000000468_S0000116 COME THERE'S NO USE IN CRYING
AUD0000000468_S0000122 ON WHICH WAS LYING A CARD WITH THE WORDS EAT ME BEAUTIFULLY PRINTED ON IT IN LARGE LETTERS
AUD0000000468_S0000127 AND LAID HER HAND ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD TO FEEL WHICH WAY IT WAS GROWING
AUD0000000468_S0000134 GOODBYE FEET
AUD0000000468_S0000140 LET ME SEE I'LL GIVE THEM A NEW PAIR OF BOOTS EVERY CHRISTMAS
AUD0000000468_S0000146 JUST AT THIS MOMENT
AUD0000000468_S0000151 IT WAS AS MUCH AS SHE COULD DO LYING DOWN ON ONE SIDE
AUD0000000468_S0000157 BUT SHE CRIED ON ALL THE SAME SHEDDING GALLONS OF TEARS
AUD0000000468_S0000162 AND DRIED HER EYES TO SEE WHAT WAS COMING
AUD0000000468_S0000168 AND AS THE RABBIT PASSED HER SHE SAID IN A LOW TIMID VOICE
AUD0000000468_S0000174 ALICE TOOK UP THE NOSEGAY AND GLOVES
AUD0000000468_S0000181 AND SHE BEGAN THINKING OVER ALL THE CHILDREN SHE KNEW OF THE SAME AGE AS HERSELF
AUD0000000468_S0000188 AND OH DEAR HOW PUZZLING IT ALL IS

AUD0000000468_S0000213 I DO WISH THEY WOULD PUT THEIR HEADS DOWN
AUD0000000468_S0000220 AND WAS GOING ON SHRINKING RAPIDLY SOON SHE FOUND OUT THAT THE REASON OF IT WAS THE NOSEGAY SHE HELD IN HER HAND SHE DROPPED IT HASTILY
AUD0000000468_S0000225 AND THE LITTLE GOLD KEY WAS LYING ON THE GLASS TABLE AS BEFORE
AUD0000000468_S0000230 HER FIRST IDEA WAS THAT SHE HAD FALLEN INTO THE SEA THEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE WAS UNDER GROUND AND SHE SOON MADE OUT THAT IT WAS THE POOL OF TEARS SHE HAD WEPT WHEN SHE WAS NINE FEET HIGH
AUD0000000468_S0000238 TO SPEAK TO THIS MOUSE
AUD0000000468_S0000244 THE MOUSE LOOKED AT HER RATHER INQUISITIVELY
AUD0000000468_S0000252 THE MOUSE GAVE A SUDDEN JUMP IN THE POOL
AUD0000000468_S0000257 NOT LIKE CATS CRIED THE MOUSE IN A SHRILL PASSIONATE VOICE
AUD0000000468_S0000262 SHE IS SUCH A DEAR QUIET THING

AUD0000000468_S0000333 AND THE DUCK QUACKED A COMFORTABLE LAUGH TO ITSELF
AUD0000000468_S0000339 BOWING GRAVELY TO THE MOUSE
AUD0000000468_S0000345 AND SOON BROUGHT THEM TO A LITTLE COTTAGE
AUD0000000468_S0000350 THEN THEY ALL SAT DOWN AGAIN IN A LARGE RING ON THE BANK AND BEGGED THE MOUSE TO BEGIN HIS STORY
AUD0000000468_S0000356 AND SHE WENT ON PUZZLING ABOUT THIS AS THE MOUSE WENT ON SPEAKING

AUD0000000468_S0000447 I DO HOPE IT'LL MAKE ME GROW LARGER
AUD0000000468_S0000453 AND HASTILY PUT DOWN THE BOTTLE SAYING TO HERSELF THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH I HOPE I SHA'N'T GROW ANY MORE I WISH I HADN'T DRUNK SO MUCH

AUD0000000468_S0000544 SAID THE VOICE OF THE RABBIT
AUD0000000468_S0000549 SHE RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AS QUICK AS SHE COULD
AUD0000000468_S0000557 AS SHE WANDERED ABOUT IN THE WOOD
AUD0000000468_S0000563 A LITTLE SHARP BARK JUST OVER HER HEAD MADE HER LOOK UP IN A GREAT HURRY
AUD0000000468_S0000568 AND SHE TRIED HARD TO WHISTLE TO IT BUT SHE WAS TERRIBLY ALARMED ALL THE WHILE AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE HUNGRY
AUD0000000468_S0000573 AND THE MOMENT SHE APPEARED AT THE OTHER SIDE
AUD0000000468_S0000578 RUNNING A VERY LITTLE WAY FORWARDS EACH TIME AND A LONG WAY BACK AND BARKING HOARSELY ALL THE WHILE
AUD0000000468_S0000584 AND TILL SHE WAS QUITE TIRED AND OUT OF BREATH
AUD0000000468_S0000591 BUT THE GREAT QUESTION IS WHAT
AUD0000000468_S0000598 SHE STRETCHED HERSELF UP ON TIPTOE
AUD0000000468_S0000604 WHO ARE YOU
AUD0000000468_S0000609 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
AUD0000000468_S0000615 SAID THE CATERPILLAR
AUD0000000468_S0000620 IT ISN'T SAID THE CATERPILLAR
AUD0000000468_S0000625 ALL I KNOW IS SAID ALICE IT WOULD FEEL QUEER TO ME
AUD0000000468_S0000631 SAID THE CATERPILLAR
AUD0000000468_S0000637 KEEP YOUR TEMPER
AUD0000000468_S0000643 AND PERHAPS AFTER ALL THE CATERPILLAR MIGHT TELL HER SOMETHING WORTH HEARING
AUD0000000468_S0000650 ALICE FOLDED HER HANDS AND BEGAN
AUD0000000468_S0000657 IN MY YOUTH SAID THE SAGE AS HE SHOOK HIS GRAY LOCKS
AUD0000000468_S0000664 I HAVE ANSWERED THREE QUESTIONS AND THAT IS ENOUGH SAID HIS FATHER DON'T GIVE YOURSELF AIRS
AUD0000000468_S0000669 IT IS WRONG FROM BEGINNING TO END
AUD0000000468_S0000675 ONLY ONE DOESN'T LIKE CHANGING SO OFTEN YOU KNOW
AUD0000000468_S0000680 THREE INCHES IS SUCH A WRETCHED HEIGHT TO BE
AUD0000000468_S0000775 NO INDEED SAID ALICE
AUD0000000468_S0000785 SAID THE MOCK TURTLE
AUD0000000468_S0000790 WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE OF IT SAID THE MOCK TURTLE
AUD0000000468_S0000796 OH YOU SING SAID THE GRYPHON
AUD0000000468_S0000801 WHILE THE MOCK TURTLE SANG
AUD0000000468_S0000806 OF ALL THE FISHES OF THE SEA THERE'S NONE SO GOOD AS SALMON
AUD0000000468_S0000811 NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTES
AUD0000000468_S0000817 SOUP OF THE EVENING BEAUTIFUL SOUP
AUD0000000468_S0000825 AND TAKING ALICE BY THE HAND HE HURRIED OFF WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE END OF THE SONG
AUD0000000468_S0000834 WITH A TRUMPET IN ONE HAND
AUD0000000468_S0000841 NOW FOR THE EVIDENCE SAID THE KING AND THEN THE SENTENCE
AUD0000000468_S0000846 HOLD YOUR TONGUE
AUD0000000468_S0000851 AND TRIED TO BEAT THEM OFF AND FOUND HERSELF LYING ON THE BANK
AUD0000000468_S0000856 AND SHE TOLD HER SISTER ALL HER ADVENTURES UNDER GROUND
AUD0000000468_S0000862 BUT HER SISTER SAT THERE SOME WHILE LONGER
AUD0000000468_S0000867 WHO SAT LISTENING WITH BRIGHT EAGER EYES TO A TALE THAT WAS BEING TOLD
AUD0000000468_S0000872 TILL IT PASSED ROUND ONE OF THE MANY TURNINGS OF THE STREAM AND SHE SAW IT NO MORE
AUD0000000487_S0000005 THE FIELD OF ART STUDY IS A WONDERFUL ONE FROM WHICH TO DRAW FOR LANGUAGE WORK
AUD0000000487_S0000011 IN THE STUDY OF AN ARTIST TAKE CARE TO HAVE A LIBERAL SUPPLY OF REPRODUCTIONS OF HIS PICTURES AT HAND
AUD0000000487_S0000016 WORK TO CULTIVATE A LOVE FOR GOOD PICTURES
AUD0000000487_S0000024 WHEN ALL THESE DELIGHTFUL THINGS CAN BE TRUTHFULLY SAID OF ONE MAN
AUD0000000487_S0000029 HE WAS GIFTED WITH ALL ADMIRABLE QUALITIES AND SO MANY-SIDED WAS HIS GENIUS THAT
AUD0000000487_S0000034 SO MUCH WAS HE ENDEARED TO HIS PUPILS THAT AFTER HE GREW TO BE FAMOUS
AUD0000000487_S0000039 MAKING WHATEVER ASSEMBLY HE ENTERED THE ABODE OF PEACE AND GOOD-WILL
AUD0000000487_S0000044 NOT ONLY WERE HIS PARENTS OF THE IDEAL SORT
AUD0000000487_S0000049 IT IS IN THE DIVISION KNOWN AS UMBRIA
AUD0000000487_S0000054 THE INHABITANTS LED SIMPLE RELIGIOUS LIVES
AUD0000000487_S0000059 TO THIS DAY THERE IS A SPIRIT OF REVERENCE THAT INSPIRES THE VISITOR TO THIS REGION
AUD0000000487_S0000064 ALL PAINTERS BELONGING TO THIS SCHOOL MADE PICTURES VERY BEAUTIFUL AND FULL OF FINE RELIGIOUS FEELING
AUD0000000487_S0000070 AND FEELING PERHAPS THAT A MORE THAN ORDINARY CHILD HAD BEEN GIVEN THEM
AUD0000000487_S0000076 IN DUE TIME A STEP-MOTHER WAS BROUGHT HOME
AUD0000000487_S0000081 SHE AND HIS UNCLE TOGETHER MANAGED HIS AFFAIRS MOST WISELY
AUD0000000487_S0000086 WENT TO THE STUDIO OF A MASTER HE DID NOT AT ONCE BEGIN TO USE COLORS
AUD0000000487_S0000091 RAPHAEL'S ASSISTANCE TO HIS FATHER MUST HAVE BEEN LARGELY OF THIS HUMBLE SORT
AUD0000000487_S0000096 AND THEN I AM SURE THERE WERE OTHER HAPPY HOURS WHEN
AUD0000000487_S0000101 THE DARK HAIR LAY LIGHTLY UPON HIS SHOULDERS
AUD0000000487_S0000106 THEY SHOWED WISDOM BY THEIR DECISION
AUD0000000487_S0000111 ALTHOUGH HE WAS OF MEAN APPEARANCE AND IGNOBLE CHARACTER
AUD0000000487_S0000116 LET HIM BE MY PUPIL HE WILL SOON BECOME MY MASTER
AUD0000000487_S0000122 MADE HIS FIRST WORK IN THE STUDIO VERY MUCH LIKE HIS MASTER'S
AUD0000000487_S0000127 NOW HERE WAS A DIFFICULTY INDEED
AUD0000000487_S0000132 AND THAT ALL BUT ONE WAS SAD INDEED AT THE RESULT
AUD0000000487_S0000137 THIS FIRST GREAT PICTURE OF RAPHAEL'S REPRESENTED THIS MARRIAGE TAKING PLACE AT THE FOOT OF THE TEMPLE STEPS
AUD0000000487_S0000142 YOU WILL BE STILL MORE INTERESTED IN RAPHAEL'S LAST PICTURE THE TRANSFIGURATION
AUD0000000487_S0000148 AND HOW AN ARTIST MUST HAVE THRILLED AT ITS VERY NAME
AUD0000000487_S0000153 SAVONAROLA PREACHING
AUD0000000487_S0000159 FLORENCE WAS THE CITY OF ALL OTHERS THAT HE LONGED TO SEE
AUD0000000487_S0000165 WE CAN ONLY GUESS AT HIS JOY IN SEEING THE WORKS HERE AND IN GREETING HIS FELLOW ARTISTS
AUD0000000487_S0000170 WHILE HERE HE PAINTED SEVERAL PICTURES
AUD0000000487_S0000175 RAPHAEL DID NOT STAY LONG IN FLORENCE AT THIS TIME BUT SOON RETURNED TO PERUGIA
AUD0000000487_S0000181 SOME OF HIS FINEST MADONNAS BELONG TO THIS TIME
AUD0000000487_S0000186 THE MADONNA HAS THE DROOPING EYES
AUD0000000487_S0000192 LIKE ALL HIS GREAT MADONNAS THE VIRGIN AND CHILDREN ARE OF SURPASSING LOVELINESS
AUD0000000487_S0000197 AND YET HIS COLOR IS SO PURE AND BEAUTIFUL THAT HE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE GREATEST COLORISTS OF THE WORLD
AUD0000000487_S0000204 HE WAS A WARRIOR AND HAD SPENT MANY YEARS FIGHTING TO GAIN LANDS AND CITIES FOR THE CHURCH
AUD0000000487_S0000209 BRAMANTE A RELATIVE OF RAPHAEL'S WAS WORKING HARD TO MAKE ST PETER'S THE MOST WONDERFUL CHURCH IN ALL THE WORLD
AUD0000000487_S0000215 WHAT BOOK
AUD0000000487_S0000222 WERE BUT A PART OF THE WONDERS TO BE SEEN
AUD0000000487_S0000228 WALKING EVER IN THE PRESENCE OF A STILL MORE WONDERFUL PAST
AUD0000000487_S0000234 IN ADDITION HE WAS TO DECORATE THE GALLERY OR CORRIDOR CALLED THE LOGGIA
AUD0000000487_S0000239 IN THESE ROOMS SOME OF HIS BEST WORK IS DONE
AUD0000000487_S0000244 ALTHOUGH RAPHAEL'S PUPILS ASSISTED LARGELY IN THESE FRESCOES THEY ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL AND WILL ALWAYS RANK HIGH AMONG THE ART WORKS OF THE TIME
AUD0000000487_S0000249 THIS IS VERY EVIDENT IN THE MADONNAS OF HIS ROMAN PERIOD
AUD0000000487_S0000254 THE DIVINE MOTHER A LITTLE OLDER THAN RAPHAEL'S VIRGINS OF EARLIER YEARS
AUD0000000487_S0000259 ON THE OTHER SIDE HE POINTS TO A PASSAGE IN THE BOOK HELD BY THE VENERABLE ST JEROME
AUD0000000487_S0000265 IT WAS STOLEN FROM NAPLES AND CARRIED TO MADRID AND THEN IN THE FRENCH WARS
AUD0000000487_S0000271 IN THE UPPER PORTION SURROUNDED BY ANGEL HEADS IS THE MADONNA HOLDING OUT HER CHILD TO US
AUD0000000487_S0000276 FOR THIS IS ONE OF THAT LARGE CLASS OF PICTURES IN ITALIAN ART CALLED VOTIVE THAT IS GIVEN TO THE CHURCH BY AN INDIVIDUAL IN RETURN FOR SOME GREAT DELIVERANCE
AUD0000000487_S0000281 THERE ARE MANY VERY INTERESTING BOOKS ABOUT RAPHAEL IN WHICH YOU CAN FIND DESCRIPTIONS OF ALL OF HIS PICTURES
AUD0000000487_S0000286 WE FIND HIM ALSO INTERESTED IN MYTHOLOGY
AUD0000000487_S0000291 SPEAKING OF RAPHAEL'S USE OF MYTHOLOGICAL SUBJECTS
AUD0000000487_S0000296 THE DRAWINGS FOR THESE PICTURES WERE MADE BY RAPHAEL BUT MOST OF THE PAINTING WAS DONE BY HIS PUPILS
AUD0000000487_S0000302 BUT LET US SAVE FROM ANY EARTHLY TOUCH OUR PAINTER OF SACRED THINGS
AUD0000000487_S0000309 DURING THE LIFE OF LEO THE POWER OF THE CHURCH SUNK TO A LOW LEVEL
AUD0000000487_S0000315 IN THE PICTURE THE SAINT STANDS IN THE CENTRE OF A GROUP MADE UP OF ST JOHN ST PAUL ST AUGUSTINE AND MARY MAGDALENE
AUD0000000487_S0000320 WHILE OUR ATTENTION IS HELD MOST OF ALL BY THE FIGURE OF ST CECILIA
AUD0000000487_S0000325 WHEN THE PICTURE WAS COMPLETED RAPHAEL SENT IT TO HIS OLD FRIEND FRANCIA
AUD0000000487_S0000332 SLIGHTLY MELLOWED BY THE PASSING YEARS
AUD0000000487_S0000337 NOW YOU KNOW THAT CARTOONS ARE THE LARGE PAPER DRAWINGS MADE PREVIOUS TO FRESCOS AND TAPESTRIES TO SERVE AS PATTERNS
AUD0000000487_S0000343 WHERE THEY WERE GREATLY ADMIRED
AUD0000000487_S0000349 THEY WERE FINALLY RECOVERED IN A FADED CONDITION AND ARE NOW IN THE VATICAN
AUD0000000487_S0000355 IS ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN OF THE SERIES
AUD0000000487_S0000360 HE CERTAINLY WAS A BUSY MAN
AUD0000000487_S0000365 FOR HE TAUGHT THEM AND HE HELPED THEM IN SICKNESS AND IN TROUBLE
AUD0000000487_S0000370 BY THE ONE THAT COULD TALK HE MEANT THE VINE-DRESSER'S DAUGHTER WHO LIVED NEAR BY AND WHO WAS VERY KIND TO HIM
AUD0000000487_S0000376 JUST AS HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD DIE OF HUNGER MARY THE VINE-DRESSER'S DAUGHTER
AUD0000000487_S0000381 THE HERMIT DIED THE OAK TREE WAS CUT DOWN AND CONVERTED INTO WINE CASKS
AUD0000000487_S0000386 THE PAINTER FOR IT WAS RAPHAEL
AUD0000000487_S0000391 HE WENT HOME AND FILLED OUT HIS SKETCH IN LOVELIEST COLOR
AUD0000000487_S0000397 HE WAS NOW RICH AND THE CARDINAL BIBBIENA OFFERED HIM HIS NIECE MARIA IN MARRIAGE
AUD0000000487_S0000402 HIS HEART WAS NOT IN THIS CONTRACT BECAUSE FOR YEARS HE HAD LOVED A HUMBLE BUT BEAUTIFUL GIRL
AUD0000000487_S0000407 IN EVERY MADONNA WE HAVE DESCRIBED WE HAVE HAD TO USE FREELY THE WORDS LOVELY GREAT BEAUTIFUL
AUD0000000487_S0000412 IT WAS PAINTED ORIGINALLY AS A BANNER FOR THE MONKS OF ST SIXTUS AT PIACENZA
AUD0000000487_S0000419 TWO GREEN CURTAINS ARE DRAWN ASIDE AND THERE FLOATING ON THE CLOUDS
AUD0000000487_S0000424 FOR HE SEES BEYOND THIS WORLD INTO ETERNITY AND THAT HIS IS NO COMMON DESTINY AT LEAST ONE FEELS THESE THINGS AS WE GAZE AT THE LOVELY APPARITION ON ITS BACKGROUND OF CLOUDS AND INNUMERABLE ANGEL HEADS
AUD0000000487_S0000430 THIS PAINTING HAS A ROOM TO ITSELF IN THE DRESDEN GALLERY
AUD0000000487_S0000435 ONE BY RAPHAEL AND ONE BY SEBASTIAN PIOMBO
AUD0000000487_S0000440 BUT SUDDENLY EVEN BEFORE THIS LATEST COMMISSION WAS COMPLETED
AUD0000000487_S0000445 AT HIS FUNERAL THIS UNFINISHED PICTURE HUNG ABOVE THE DEAD PAINTER
AUD0000000487_S0000451 FROM A FEVER CONTRACTED WHILE SEARCHING FOR REMAINS AMONG THE RUINS OF ROME
AUD0000000487_S0000456 AND HIS OTHER PROPERTY WAS DISTRIBUTED AMONG HIS RELATIVES
AUD0000000487_S0000462 THEY URGED THE AUTHORITIES TO OPEN THE GRAVE TO PROVE THEIR POSITION
AUD0000000487_S0000467 MENTION HAS OFTEN BEEN MADE OF RAPHAEL'S PERSONAL BEAUTY
AUD0000000487_S0000472 JUDGED BY THE MORAL STANDARD OF HIS TIME HE WAS ABSOLUTELY SPOTLESS

AUD0000000487_S0000519 TO UNDERSTAND EITHER WE MUST KNOW THE LAND
AUD0000000487_S0000525 AND SWEPT DURING A LARGE PART OF THE YEAR BY CHILLING WINDS
AUD0000000487_S0000530 IN ANDALUSIA HOWEVER THINGS WERE DIFFERENT
AUD0000000487_S0000535 GAVE A PECULIAR CHARACTER TO THE ART OF SPAIN
AUD0000000487_S0000540 IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EXTREME RELIGIOUS ZEAL
AUD0000000487_S0000545 AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD HER FEET BE EXPOSED
AUD0000000487_S0000550 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PROPERLY PRESCRIBE COLORS AND FORMS FOR THE ARTIST
AUD0000000487_S0000555 IF WE STUDY THE KINGS OF SPAIN
AUD0000000487_S0000561 THEN THESE RULERS WERE VAIN AND HAD A GREAT LIKING FOR HAVING THEIR PORTRAITS PAINTED
AUD0000000487_S0000566 SO WE SEE THAT
AUD0000000487_S0000574 LIVED DURING THE GREATER PART OF MURILLO'S LIFETIME AND DIVIDED HONORS WITH HIM
AUD0000000487_S0000580 THE PRINCES
AUD0000000487_S0000585 A SUBJECT WORTH PAINTING
AUD0000000487_S0000591 NOR CAN WE FORGET HIS IDEAL PORTRAIT OF AESOP
AUD0000000487_S0000596 AND IF WE HAVE NOT ALREADY DONE SO WE READ HIS BOOK BECAUSE WE MUST
AUD0000000487_S0000606 WE ARE REASONABLE IN PRESUMING THAT THUS WAS SPAIN ROBBED OF TEN YEARS OF A STRONG ARTIST'S LIFE AND WORK
AUD0000000487_S0000611 WE CANNOT FORGET HOWEVER MUCH WE MAY ABHOR THE RELIGION OF THE ARABS
AUD0000000487_S0000617 THE MOST SOUTHERN PART OF SPAIN

AUD0000000487_S0000658 EVEN THIS MURILLO'S FATHER FOUND TO BE A HEAVY BURDEN
AUD0000000487_S0000663 AS IN THE CASE OF VELAZQUEZ
AUD0000000487_S0000668 ANOTHER UNCLE
AUD0000000487_S0000674 LIFE WITH HIM IN THOSE DAYS WAS MERELY A STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE
AUD0000000487_S0000679 THEY DEMANDED TWO THINGS BRIGHT COLORS AND STRIKING FIGURES
AUD0000000487_S0000684 THERE WERE ALSO IMMENSE ADVANTAGES
AUD0000000487_S0000689 ARE KINGS OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS
AUD0000000487_S0000694 HE AT ONCE SET ABOUT EARNING A LITTLE MONEY TO ASSIST HIM IN THE JOURNEY
AUD0000000487_S0000701 HIS LITTLE STOCK OF MONEY WAS SOON EXHAUSTED
AUD0000000487_S0000708 AND OF HIS DESIRE TO VISIT ROME AND FLANDERS
AUD0000000487_S0000713 WHEN VELAZQUEZ RETURNED AFTER LONG ABSENCE
AUD0000000487_S0000718 THE FIRST THREE YEARS AFTER HIS RETURN TO SEVILLE
AUD0000000487_S0000723 THEY WERE ADMIRABLY DONE
AUD0000000487_S0000728 HERE ARE SOME OF THE NAMES HE GIVES THESE PICTURES
AUD0000000487_S0000733 NOTICE TOO THE BEAUTY OF THE FACES
AUD0000000487_S0000738 WHAT LUSCIOUS GRAPES WHAT A BACK-GROUND UNKEMPT LIKE THEMSELVES
AUD0000000487_S0000743 HE PASSED GRADUALLY TO THE PAINTING OF THINGS PURELY IMAGINARY TO THOSE VISIBLE ONLY TO HIS OWN MIND
AUD0000000487_S0000749 THIS WAS ONE OF THE PICTURES THAT WELL-NIGH BROUGHT TROUBLE ON MURILLO FROM SOME ZEALOUS CHURCHMEN BEFORE REFERRED TO
AUD0000000487_S0000754 HE HAD NUMEROUS COMMISSIONS AND IN SOCIETY HE MINGLED WITH THE BEST IN THE LAND
AUD0000000487_S0000760 FROM HIS CANVAS THE ARTIST'S EYES WANDERED TO THE WORSHIPPER
AUD0000000487_S0000765 THE PAINTER DOUBTLESS PROVED THE TRUTH OF WORDSWORTH'S BEAUTIFUL LINES
AUD0000000487_S0000770 HOWEVER THIS MAY BE WE KNOW THAT SHE IS OFTEN PAINTED AS THE VIRGIN IN MURILLO'S GREAT PICTURES
AUD0000000487_S0000776 WHILE THE DAUGHTER DEVOTED HERSELF TO RELIGION AND ENTERED A CONVENT
AUD0000000487_S0000781 SO THAT EVERY NEW PICTURE WAS AN ADDITIONAL PLEDGE OF HIS GREATNESS
AUD0000000487_S0000787 HE HAS LEFT US AT LEAST TWENTY DIFFERENT PICTURES EMBODYING THIS DOCTRINE
AUD0000000487_S0000793 AMONG ALL THESE THE VISION OF MURILLO TAKES AN EQUAL RANK
AUD0000000487_S0000798 AND WITH THE CRESCENT MOON
AUD0000000487_S0000805 WE HAVE BUT TO TURN TO THE WARS OF NAPOLEON AND THE CAMPAIGNS IN THE SPANISH PENINSULA
AUD0000000487_S0000811 THERE IS BUT ONE MITIGATING THOUGHT REGARDING THIS RAPINE OF THE FRENCH AND THAT IS THAT MANY ART TREASURES

AUD0000000487_S0000832 THERE IS THE KNEELING SAINT WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS REACHING FORWARD TO EMBRACE THE CHRIST CHILD
AUD0000000487_S0000838 AND THOSE ARE PERISHABLE LILIES IN THE VASE THERE BY THE OPEN BOOK
AUD0000000487_S0000843 AND IN THE CATHEDRAL STILL WE MAY VIEW MURILLO'S MASTERPIECE
AUD0000000487_S0000849 IT MAY NOT BE OUT OF PLACE TO STOP HERE AND NOTICE THE WONDERFUL VARIETY OF HOLY CHILDREN THAT MURILLO HAS GIVEN US
AUD0000000487_S0000854 LET US TURN TO THAT DEAR LITTLE BOY OF OLDER GROWTH
AUD0000000487_S0000861 THEY ARE CHILDREN DRAWN FROM THE SKY QUITE AS MUCH AS THE JESUS IN THE FAMOUS ST ANTHONY PICTURE
AUD0000000487_S0000866 IF BY SOME MIRACLE THESE CHILDREN COULD ALL COME TO LIFE
AUD0000000487_S0000872 IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD GREATLY FELT THE NEED OF SUCH AN INSTITUTION
AUD0000000487_S0000880 BUT IT HAD BEEN NEGLECTED UNTIL IT WAS ALMOST IN RUINS
AUD0000000487_S0000885 MOSES STRIKING THE ROCK AND ELIZABETH OF HUNGARY TENDING THE SICK

AUD0000000487_S0000962 WHEN MURILLO DIED HE WAS BURIED ACCORDING TO HIS WISH IMMEDIATELY UNDER THIS PICTURE
AUD0000000487_S0000968 IN LATER YEARS A STATUE OF BRONZE WAS ERECTED IN ONE OF THE SQUARES OF THE CITY IN HONOR OF MURILLO THERE IT STANDS
AUD0000000487_S0000973 HIS RELIGIOUS ZEAL WAS GREAT
AUD0000000487_S0000978 AND HIS HABIT OF NOT SIGNING THEM MADE IT EASY TO IMPOSE ON UNWARY SEEKERS AFTER HIS PAINTINGS

AUD0000000487_S0001011 OR THE TIME WHEN HE CAME INTO THE WORLD
AUD0000000487_S0001016 HERE THEN IS JUST A LITTLE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS MOST INTERESTING COUNTRY ONE OF THE RICHEST POSSESSIONS OF SPAIN IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY WAS KNOWN AS THE NETHERLANDS
AUD0000000487_S0001022 THE NORTHERN PROVINCES WHICH WE KNOW AS HOLLAND DECLARED THEIR INDEPENDENCE
AUD0000000487_S0001027 SPLENDID CITIES LIKE BRUGES GHENT AND ANTWERP BECAME THE SEATS OF COMMERCE AND THEIR ARTISTS AND WORKMEN OF ALL SORTS WERE KNOWN THROUGHOUT EUROPE FOR THEIR THRIFT AND THE EXCELLENCE OF THEIR WORKMANSHIP
AUD0000000487_S0001032 AND WITHIN HER WALLS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVED IN PLENTY
AUD0000000487_S0001170 EVEN THE NARROW CROOKED STREETS HOLD THEIR SHARE OF BEAUTY
AUD0000000487_S0001175 THROUGH ALL THE YEARS STANDS THE LITTLE MAN WITH A GOOSE UNDER EITHER ARM
AUD0000000487_S0001180 COPIED FROM DURER'S PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF IN VIENNA
AUD0000000487_S0001185 HERE TOO ARE MANY FINE OLD HOUSES WHICH USED TO BELONG TO NOBLEMEN OF THE CITY
AUD0000000487_S0001190 WHO GAVE HIS LIFE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEATING NAPOLEON
AUD0000000487_S0001196 IN OUR SEARCH FOR INTERESTING THINGS IN OLD NUREMBERG
AUD0000000487_S0001203 ADAM KRAFT
AUD0000000487_S0001208 ARE STILL STANDING
AUD0000000487_S0001213 SO THAT MANY OF THE NEWER HOUSES ARE BUILT IN THE OLD STYLE WITH THEIR GABLES TO THE STREET
AUD0000000487_S0001218 IT WAS TRULY A WONDERFUL AGE IN WHICH TO LIVE
AUD0000000487_S0001223 WHO WISHED NOT TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE OLD CHURCH
AUD0000000487_S0001228 THROUGH THE WISDOM OF HER CITIZENS WERE NOT CALLED UPON TO WITHSTAND SIEGES AND OTHER MILITARY ATTACKS
AUD0000000487_S0001234 THE TOILING MAN OR WOMAN IS OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY ANGELS AND DEMONS
AUD0000000487_S0001240 THERE WANDERED INTO THE FAR-FAMED CITY OF NUREMBERG A YOUNG GOLDSMITH FROM HUNGARY
AUD0000000487_S0001245 ALBRECHT DURER
AUD0000000487_S0001250 THE OTHER AS THE MOST LEARNED MAN OF NUREMBERG
AUD0000000487_S0001255 AND SOON MARRIED HIS MASTER'S COMELY DAUGHTER BARBARA
AUD0000000487_S0001260 AS THE YEARS WENT BY SEVENTEEN OTHER CHILDREN CAME TO THE DURER HOME
AUD0000000487_S0001265 HE HAD A GREAT REPUTATION WITH MANY WHO KNEW HIM
AUD0000000487_S0001270 WAS OF FEW WORDS
AUD0000000487_S0001276 DURER WAS FAITHFUL TO HIS TRUST AND CARED TENDERLY FOR HIS MOTHER UNTIL HER DEATH SEVERAL YEARS LATER
AUD0000000487_S0001281 WE FIND HIM
AUD0000000487_S0001286 FREE LATIN SCHOOLS WERE ESTABLISHED TO MEET THE NEEDS
AUD0000000487_S0001291 ALBRECHT'S DRAWING WAS SUPERIOR TO THAT USUALLY DONE IN A GOLDSMITH'S SHOP
AUD0000000487_S0001296 REGRETTING ONLY THAT HE HAD LOST SO MUCH TIME LEARNING THE GOLDSMITH'S TRADE
AUD0000000487_S0001301 FOR THE ART OF PAINTING WAS THEN NEW IN THE PROSPEROUS CITY OF THE PEGNITZ
AUD0000000487_S0001308 ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF HIS COUNTRYMEN
AUD0000000487_S0001313 WE HAVE LITTLE CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE HE SPENT THESE YEARS BUT WE FEEL QUITE SURE THAT ONE OF THE PLACES HE VISITED WAS COLMAR
AUD0000000487_S0001319 IT IS SUPPOSED THAT THE FATHER SENT FOR THIS PORTRAIT TO HELP HIM ALONG IN HIS ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MARRIAGE OF HIS SON
AUD0000000487_S0001324 THE WOMAN SELECTED BY DURER'S FATHER WAS A HANDSOME WOMAN OF GOOD FAMILY WITH A SMALL FORTUNE OF HER OWN
AUD0000000487_S0001329 BECAME OFFENDED WITH HER
AUD0000000487_S0001334 WITHOUT KNOWING PIRKHEIMER'S DESIRE FOR THESE
AUD0000000487_S0001339 THE EARLIER WORKS OF DURER ARE LARGELY WOOD-CUTS
AUD0000000487_S0001344 A PLACE THUS SEEMED WAITING FOR ALBRECHT DURER
AUD0000000487_S0001349 THESE WERE FOLLOWED BY STILL ANOTHER SERIES ILLUSTRATING THE LIFE OF MARY
AUD0000000487_S0001354 THE CASTLES AND CHURCHES THAT FIGURE IN THE BACKGROUNDS ARE THOSE OF MEDIAEVAL AND RENAISSANCE GERMANY
AUD0000000487_S0001360 BUT MORE LIKELY BECAUSE THE ARTIST WISHED TO WORK IN THE SUNSHINE AND ART ATMOSPHERE OF THE ISLAND CITY
AUD0000000487_S0001365 THEY COMPLAINED THAT HIS ART WAS LIKE NOTHING SET DOWN AS CORRECT OR CLASSICAL BUT STILL THEY ADMIRED IT AND COPIED IT TOO ON THE SLY
AUD0000000487_S0001371 HE BEGGED HIM TO ALLOW HIM TO USE THE BRUSH THAT HAD DONE SUCH WONDERFUL WORK
AUD0000000487_S0001376 THE MOST IMPORTANT PICTURE DURER PAINTED WHILE IN VENICE WAS THE MADONNA OF THE ROSE GARLANDS
AUD0000000487_S0001381 I HAVE SILENCED ALL THE PAINTERS WHO SAID THAT I WAS GOOD AT ENGRAVING BUT COULD NOT MANAGE COLOR
AUD0000000487_S0001386 BUT THE TIES OF AFFECTION WHICH BOUND HIM TO HIS HOME CITY DREW HIM BACK TO NUREMBERG
AUD0000000487_S0001391 ALTHOUGH DURER STUDIED AND ENJOYED THE WORKS OF THE ITALIAN MASTERS
AUD0000000487_S0001396 HE PAINTED ONE OF HIS GREATEST PICTURES AT THIS TIME
AUD0000000487_S0001401 BELOW IN ONE CORNER IS DURER'S UNMISTAKABLE SIGNATURE
AUD0000000487_S0001408 BEAUTIFUL VINE TRACERIES AND ARCHITECTURAL ORNAMENTS WHICH SHOWED OUR ARTIST MASTER OF STILL ANOTHER NATIONAL ART WOOD-CARVING
AUD0000000487_S0001413 TO THIS PERIOD BELONGS THAT TINY TRIUMPH OF HIS ART
AUD0000000487_S0001418 INSTEAD OF GOING TO SOME LARGE PUBLISHING HOUSE AS WE TO-DAY DO
AUD0000000487_S0001423 THERE WAS READY SALE FOR ALL THE BOOKS DURER COULD PRINT
AUD0000000487_S0001428 JULIO ROMANO
AUD0000000487_S0001434 IN THIS ROOM WHICH WAS IN A CITIZEN'S HOUSE
AUD0000000487_S0001439 AND THE LATTER BECAUSE CHARLEMAGNE WAS A FAVORITE HERO WITH THE GERMANS
AUD0000000487_S0001445 NO LESS A PERSONAGE THAN THE EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN
AUD0000000487_S0001451 THE ONE CALLED THE TRIUMPHAL ARCH AND THE OTHER THE TRIUMPHAL CAR
AUD0000000487_S0001456 IT WAS WHILE THIS WORK WAS GOING FORWARD THAT THE WELL-KNOWN SAYING
AUD0000000487_S0001461 ONE EXPRESSION OF DURER'S REGARDING THE ORNAMENTATION OF THE CAR SHOWS HIM SKILLED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE COURTIER AS WELL AS IN THAT OF THE CITIZEN
AUD0000000487_S0001466 THE NOTED PRAYER BOOK OF MAXIMILIAN WAS THE OTHER WORK DONE FOR THE EMPEROR
AUD0000000487_S0001471 OR IT MAY BE THAT THE CRAFTY FOX BEGUILES THE UNSUSPECTING FOWLS WITH MUSIC FROM A STOLEN FLUTE
AUD0000000487_S0001476 WHEN ASKED WHY IT DID NOT DO SO IN THE FINGERS OF THE ARTIST
AUD0000000487_S0001481 YOUR MAJESTY HAS OTHER AND MORE DIFFICULT WORK TO DO
AUD0000000487_S0001488 EVERYWHERE HE WAS RECEIVED WITH THE MOST MARKED ATTENTION
AUD0000000487_S0001493 THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE FOUR HUNDRED TWO-STORIED ARCHES ERECTED FOR THE OCCASION IMPRESSED DURER DEEPLY
AUD0000000487_S0001498 AFTER ALL HIS TROUBLE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED AT HIS JOURNEY'S END FOR THE WHALE HAD BEEN WASHED AWAY BEFORE HE ARRIVED
AUD0000000487_S0001503 THERE WERE BUT SEVEN YEARS OF LIFE LEFT TO OUR PAINTER AND THESE WERE BURDENED WITH BROKEN HEALTH
AUD0000000487_S0001508 NOW ALSO IN VIENNA
AUD0000000487_S0001513 PRAYED FERVENTLY TO BE RESIGNED TO A SECOND PLACE
AUD0000000487_S0001519 DURER DEEPLY MOVED BY THE THOUGHT OF THE TIME
AUD0000000487_S0001524 A MOST DIFFICULT THING TO DO AS WE CAN EASILY IMAGINE
AUD0000000487_S0001529 A POWERFUL WINGED WOMAN SITS IN DESPAIR IN THE MIDST OF THE USELESS IMPLEMENTS OF THE ART OF SCIENCE
AUD0000000487_S0001534 PERHAPS NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN ACCURATELY THE MEANING OF THIS GREAT ENGRAVING AND THEREIN LIES THE GREATNESS
AUD0000000487_S0001539 HE PAINTED THESE WITHOUT CHARGE AS A SORT OF MEMORIAL OF HIMSELF IN HIS NATIVE TOWN
AUD0000000487_S0001544 JOHN IS THE TYPE OF THE MELANCHOLY
AUD0000000487_S0001550 ONLY COPIES ARE NOW TO BE SEEN IN NUREMBERG
AUD0000000487_S0001555 IT IS REALLY THE SUMMING UP OF MUCH THAT HE HAD DONE FROM TIME TO TIME ALL THROUGH HIS BUSY LIFE TIME
AUD0000000487_S0001560 ARE WELL REPRESENTED IN THIS SPLENDID MOUNTED KNIGHT
AUD0000000487_S0001565 I BELIEVE I DO NOT EXAGGERATE WHEN I PARTICULARIZE THIS POINT AS THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK WHICH THE FANTASTIC SPIRIT OF GERMAN ART HAS PRODUCED
AUD0000000487_S0001573 THE HISTORIAN OF GERMAN PAINTERS
AUD0000000487_S0001578 IN MANY ARTS UNEQUALED IN THE OLD TIME OR THE LATE
AUD0000000487_S0001583 DURER'S CHARACTER WAS ONE OF THE PUREST TO BE FOUND ON THE HONOR-LIST OF THE WORLD
AUD0000000487_S0001588 THAT HE WAS ARCHITECT SCULPTOR PAINTER ENGRAVER
AUD0000000487_S0001593 IN CLOSING THIS SKETCH
AUD0000000487_S0001598 NUREMBERG THE ANCIENT STANDS
AUD0000000487_S0001604 STANDS THE MIGHTY LINDEN PLANTED BY QUEEN CUNIGUNDE'S HAND ON THE SQUARE THE ORIEL WINDOW WHERE IN OLD HEROIC DAYS

AUD0000000487_S0001614 HENCE IN SILENCE AND IN SORROW
AUD0000000487_S0001621 BY JENNIE ELLIS KEYSOR
AUD0000000494_S0000009 AND THAT I WAS NOT NOTICING
AUD0000000494_S0000014 I FEEL EXACTLY LIKE AN EXPERIMENT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON TO FEEL MORE LIKE AN EXPERIMENT THAN I DO
AUD0000000494_S0000020 IS MY POSITION ASSURED OR DO I HAVE TO WATCH IT AND TAKE CARE OF IT
AUD0000000494_S0000027 NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL WORKS OF ART SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECTED TO HASTE AND THIS MAJESTIC NEW WORLD IS INDEED A MOST NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL WORK
AUD0000000494_S0000032 THERE ISN'T ANOTHER THING AMONG THE ORNAMENTS AND DECORATIONS THAT IS COMPARABLE TO IT FOR BEAUTY AND FINISH
AUD0000000494_S0000037 BUT I ALREADY BEGIN TO REALIZE THAT THE CORE AND CENTER OF MY NATURE IS LOVE OF THE BEAUTIFUL
AUD0000000494_S0000043 STARS ARE GOOD TOO
AUD0000000494_S0000049 BUT IT DIDN'T REACH WHICH ASTONISHED ME THEN I TRIED CLODS TILL I WAS ALL TIRED OUT
AUD0000000494_S0000055 SO I CRIED A LITTLE
AUD0000000494_S0000060 BUT IT WAS FARTHER THAN I THOUGHT
AUD0000000494_S0000067 IF I COULD HAVE ONE OF THOSE SKINS IT WOULD MAKE A LOVELY GOWN
AUD0000000494_S0000073 ALL OUT OF MY OWN HEAD MY VERY FIRST ONE THE SCRATCHED EXPERIMENT SHUNS THE THORN
AUD0000000494_S0000079 I THINK IT IS A MAN
AUD0000000494_S0000084 IF IT IS A REPTILE AND I SUPPOSE IT IS FOR IT HAS FROWZY HAIR AND BLUE EYES
AUD0000000494_S0000089 I WAS AFRAID OF IT AT FIRST AND STARTED TO RUN EVERY TIME IT TURNED AROUND
AUD0000000494_S0000096 I'VE GOT IT UP THE TREE AGAIN
AUD0000000494_S0000102 THEY RETURNED THE MOON LAST NIGHT AND I WAS SO HAPPY
AUD0000000494_S0000108 FOR WE HAVE MORE THAN WE CAN USE
AUD0000000494_S0000113 AND I HAD TO CLOD IT TO MAKE IT GO UP THE TREE AGAIN AND LET THEM ALONE
AUD0000000494_S0000118 IT HAS THE LOOK OF IT
AUD0000000494_S0000123 I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORDS
AUD0000000494_S0000129 AND WOULD NEVER STOP IF DESIRED
AUD0000000494_S0000135 I THINK SO
AUD0000000494_S0000141 NEXT WEEK SUNDAY ALL THE WEEK I TAGGED AROUND AFTER HIM AND TRIED TO GET ACQUAINTED
AUD0000000494_S0000146 BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO FLATTER HIM TO BE INCLUDED
AUD0000000494_S0000151 AND SHOWS THAT HE LIKES TO HAVE ME WITH HIM
AUD0000000494_S0000156 AND THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT RELIEF TO HIM
AUD0000000494_S0000161 IN THIS WAY I HAVE SAVED HIM MANY EMBARRASSMENTS
AUD0000000494_S0000166 I SEEM TO KNOW JUST BY THE SHAPE OF THE CREATURE AND THE WAY IT ACTS WHAT ANIMAL IT IS WHEN THE DODO CAME ALONG HE THOUGHT IT WAS A WILDCAT I SAW IT IN HIS EYE
AUD0000000494_S0000172 IF THERE ISN'T THE DODO
AUD0000000494_S0000177 AND I THOUGHT OF IT MORE THAN ONCE WITH GRATIFICATION BEFORE I SLEPT
AUD0000000494_S0000183 SO I WENT AWAY AND SAT LONELY IN THE PLACE WHERE I FIRST SAW HIM THE MORNING THAT WE WERE MADE AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS AND WAS INDIFFERENT ABOUT HIM BUT NOW IT WAS A MOURNFUL PLACE AND EVERY LITTLE THING SPOKE OF HIM
AUD0000000494_S0000188 AND I COULD NOT MAKE IT OUT
AUD0000000494_S0000198 I TRIED TO GET HIM SOME OF THOSE APPLES
AUD0000000494_S0000203 AND HE SAYS I SHALL COME TO HARM BUT SO I COME TO HARM THROUGH PLEASING HIM
AUD0000000494_S0000208 IT IS STRANGE
AUD0000000494_S0000214 IT IS SUCH A PITY THAT HE SHOULD FEEL SO
AUD0000000494_S0000222 FOR HE WORKED IT IN TWICE AFTERWARD
AUD0000000494_S0000228 NO HE TOOK NO INTEREST IN MY NAME
AUD0000000494_S0000233 SOME ONE TO LOOK AT SOME ONE TO TALK TO
AUD0000000494_S0000238 AND MY ONLY ONE IT IS MY SISTER
AUD0000000494_S0000245 AND THERE WAS NO SOLACE FOR ME
AUD0000000494_S0000251 SOMETIMES SHE STAYED AWAY MAYBE AN HOUR
AUD0000000494_S0000256 AND IT WAS SO SHE ALWAYS DID
AUD0000000494_S0000263 AT NOON I STOPPED FOR THE DAY AND TOOK MY RECREATION BY FLITTING ALL ABOUT WITH THE BEES AND THE BUTTERFLIES AND REVELING IN THE FLOWERS THOSE BEAUTIFUL CREATURES THAT CATCH THE SMILE OF GOD OUT OF THE SKY AND PRESERVE IT
AUD0000000494_S0000268 NOTHING WOULD HAVE COME OF IT FOR HE DOES NOT CARE FOR FLOWERS
AUD0000000494_S0000274 EXCEPT BUILDING SHACKS TO COOP HIMSELF UP IN FROM THE GOOD CLEAN RAIN
AUD0000000494_S0000279 A THIN TRANSPARENT BLUISH FILM ROSE OUT OF THE HOLE
AUD0000000494_S0000284 AND LET MY LIMBS GO ON TREMBLING UNTIL THEY GOT STEADY AGAIN THEN I CREPT WARILY BACK ALERT WATCHING
AUD0000000494_S0000291 AND TOOK IT OUT AGAIN
AUD0000000494_S0000297 THOUGH I HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE
AUD0000000494_S0000303 THINKING TO RAISE MYSELF IN HIS ESTEEM BUT I REFLECTED
AUD0000000494_S0000309 FOR IT WASN'T GOOD FOR ANYTHING IT COULD NOT BUILD A SHACK IT COULD NOT IMPROVE MELONS
AUD0000000494_S0000314 FOR YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THAT IS ENOUGH
AUD0000000494_S0000319 THE BURNT EXPERIMENT SHUNS THE FIRE
AUD0000000494_S0000325 THOUGH THESE WERE THE VERY FIRST FLAMES THAT HAD EVER BEEN IN THE WORLD
AUD0000000494_S0000330 AND SAID NOT A WORD FOR MANY MINUTES
AUD0000000494_S0000335 IF IT ANNOYED HIM THAT I SHOULD KNOW AND HE MUST ASK THAT WAS NOT MY FAULT I HAD NO DESIRE TO ANNOY HIM
AUD0000000494_S0000341 HE WENT TO THE EDGE OF THE BURNED PLACE AND STOOD LOOKING DOWN AND SAID WHAT ARE THESE
AUD0000000494_S0000346 BUT I WAS INTERESTED
AUD0000000494_S0000351 SPOILED APPARENTLY BUT IT WAS NOT SO THEY WERE BETTER THAN RAW ONES FIRE IS BEAUTIFUL SOME DAY IT WILL BE USEFUL I THINK
AUD0000000494_S0000357 BUT HE WAS NOT PLEASED AND TURNED AWAY AND LEFT ME
AUD0000000494_S0000363 IT MAKES ME SHIVER AND TREMBLE AND SHUDDER
AUD0000000494_S0000372 SHE MUST PET IT AND CARESS IT AND SMELL IT AND TALK TO IT
AUD0000000494_S0000377 GREEN FOLIAGE BLUE SKY THE PEARL OF THE DAWN
AUD0000000494_S0000382 NONE OF THEM IS OF ANY PRACTICAL VALUE SO FAR AS I CAN SEE
AUD0000000494_S0000389 SHAPELY NIMBLE GRACEFUL
AUD0000000494_S0000395 THERE ARE ANIMALS THAT I AM INDIFFERENT TO
AUD0000000494_S0000400 WHEN THE MIGHTY BRONTOSAURUS CAME STRIDING INTO CAMP SHE REGARDED IT AS AN ACQUISITION
AUD0000000494_S0000406 EVEN WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS AND WITHOUT MEANING ANY HARM
AUD0000000494_S0000414 AND LOOK AT THE SCENERY
AUD0000000494_S0000419 WAS SHE SATISFIED NOW
AUD0000000494_S0000425 SHE HAD ONE THEORY REMAINING ABOUT THIS COLOSSUS SHE THOUGHT THAT IF WE COULD TAME IT AND MAKE HIM FRIENDLY WE COULD STAND IN THE RIVER AND USE HIM FOR A BRIDGE
AUD0000000494_S0000432 FRIDAY I HAD TO HAVE COMPANY I WAS MADE FOR IT I THINK SO I MADE FRIENDS WITH THE ANIMALS
AUD0000000494_S0000437 AND THEY ARE ALWAYS READY FOR A ROMP OR AN EXCURSION OR ANYTHING YOU WANT TO PROPOSE
AUD0000000494_S0000442 LONESOME
AUD0000000494_S0000447 YOU HAVE A BLAZING UP OF ALL THE COLORS YOU CAN THINK OF
AUD0000000494_S0000452 WHEN WE ARE ON THE MARCH IT IS AN IMPOSING SIGHT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT ANYWHERE
AUD0000000494_S0000457 BUT I CAN GET OFF MYSELF WHEN WE ARE READY TO CAMP
AUD0000000494_S0000462 BUT IT MUST BE A FOREIGN LANGUAGE FOR I CANNOT MAKE OUT A WORD THEY SAY YET THEY OFTEN UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TALK BACK
AUD0000000494_S0000467 I HAVE LEARNED A NUMBER OF THINGS
AUD0000000494_S0000472 I WAS NEVER SMART ENOUGH TO BE AROUND WHEN THE WATER WAS RUNNING UPHILL BUT NOW I DO NOT MIND
AUD0000000494_S0000477 YOU NEVER GET EDUCATED
AUD0000000494_S0000483 EVEN TRYING TO FIND OUT AND NOT FINDING OUT IS JUST AS INTERESTING AS TRYING TO FIND OUT AND FINDING OUT
AUD0000000494_S0000489 SUCH THINGS MAKE ME SAD BECAUSE BY AND BY WHEN I HAVE FOUND OUT EVERYTHING THERE WON'T BE ANY MORE EXCITEMENTS
AUD0000000494_S0000494 I THINK THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO LEARN YET I HOPE SO AND BY ECONOMIZING AND NOT HURRYING TOO FAST I THINK THEY WILL LAST WEEKS AND WEEKS I HOPE SO
AUD0000000494_S0000500 I SUPPOSE IT IS AN OPTICAL ILLUSION
AUD0000000494_S0000505 AND LET A PERSON TAKE HIS CHOICE
AUD0000000494_S0000510 THAT SORROW WILL COME I KNOW IT
AUD0000000494_S0000516 ENCHANTINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND NOW IT IS LOST
AUD0000000494_S0000522 AND THIS I THINK IS PROPER TO MY YOUTH AND SEX
AUD0000000494_S0000528 I LOVE CERTAIN BIRDS BECAUSE OF THEIR SONG BUT I DO NOT LOVE ADAM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS SINGING NO
AUD0000000494_S0000533 BECAUSE AT FIRST I COULD NOT STAND IT
AUD0000000494_S0000538 IT IS NOT THAT
AUD0000000494_S0000544 IN TIME IT WILL DEVELOP THOUGH I THINK IT WILL NOT BE SUDDEN AND BESIDES THERE IS NO HURRY HE IS WELL ENOUGH JUST AS HE IS
AUD0000000494_S0000549 AND IS IMPROVING
AUD0000000494_S0000554 IT IS MY ONLY PAIN
AUD0000000494_S0000559 BUT I WILL PUT IT OUT OF MY MIND IT SHALL NOT TROUBLE MY HAPPINESS WHICH IS OTHERWISE FULL TO OVERFLOWING
AUD0000000494_S0000564 IT IS NOT THAT
AUD0000000494_S0000570 AND I DO NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR IT
AUD0000000494_S0000575 BUT I COULD LOVE HIM WITHOUT IT
AUD0000000494_S0000580 HE IS STRONG AND HANDSOME
AUD0000000494_S0000585 YES I THINK I LOVE HIM MERELY BECAUSE HE IS MINE AND IS MASCULINE
AUD0000000494_S0000591 BUT I AM ONLY A GIRL

AUD0000000515_S0000849 MALLORY FROWNED IN THE DARKNESS
AUD0000000515_S0000854 AND AT LENGTH HE CONCLUDED THAT THE NOTE OF DISCORD HAD ORIGINATED IN HIS IMAGINATION
AUD0000000515_S0000860 ALL MALLORY COULD DO WAS TO MAKE HIS MOVE AFTER THE FAIT ACCCOMPLI IN THE HOPE THAT THAT WAS WHEN HE HAD MADE HIS MOVE
AUD0000000515_S0000865 FOR IF IT WASN'T IN THE BOOKS FOR HIM TO WREST THE CUP FROM SIR LAUNCELOT
AUD0000000515_S0000870 RETURN TO THE COURTYARD AND COME RIDING BACK TO THE PORTCULLIS

AUD0000000515_S0001484 ROWENA
AUD0000000515_S0001489 BUT OTHERWISE HE WAS UNAWARE OF HIS WOUND
AUD0000000515_S0001494 A WAVE OF VERTIGO BROKE OVER HIM
AUD0000000515_S0001500 HE CALLED AGAIN
AUD0000000515_S0001505 SOMETHING HAD AWAKENED HIM THAT WAS IT
AUD0000000515_S0001511 HE KNEW THEN WHAT WAS WRONG
AUD0000000515_S0001517 HIS EYES LEAPED TO THE REC-HALL TABLE
AUD0000000515_S0001523 HE WALKED OVER TO THE TELEWINDOW NEAREST THE LOCK AND SCRUTINIZED THE SCREEN

AUD0000000515_S0001553 WITH A LITTLE LUCK HE WOULD HAVE NEED OF NONE
AUD0000000515_S0001559 BUT HE DID DISCERN SEVERAL DISLODGED STONES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THROWN UP BY THE BLACK ROHORSE'S HOOFS
AUD0000000515_S0001564 AND ROWENA
AUD0000000515_S0001569 THE INFRA-RED RAYS OF EASY MONEY'S EYE UNITS WERE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR THE TASK ON HAND
AUD0000000515_S0001575 THE FLICKERING LIGHT GREW GRADUALLY BRIGHTER
AUD0000000515_S0001581 AND BORS SMOTE HIM SO HARD THAT IT WENT THROUGH HIS SHIELD AND HABERGEON ON THE LEFT SHOULDER
AUD0000000515_S0001587 SO SHALL I DO GLADLY AND TOOK THE HORSE OF THE WOUNDED KNIGHT

AUD0000000515_S0001636 NOT TO MENTION THE APPLICATION OF A LUSTRE-RICH BROWN HAIR-DYE AND THE INSERTION OF A PAIR OF PLUM-BLUE CONTACT LENSES

AUD0000000515_S0001669 BUT WITH CONSIDERABLE LESS CONVICTION
AUD0000000515_S0001675 ONE OF THOSE DO-GOODERS WHO RUN AROUND HISTORY REPLACING STOLEN GOODS AND TURNING IN HARD-WORKING PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF
AUD0000000515_S0001681 FOR A WHILE MALLORY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
AUD0000000515_S0001686 THE DAMOSEL ROWENA DESPITE ALL EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY AND DESPITE THE GLARING PARADOX THE ADMISSION GAVE RISE TO

AUD0000000515_S0001718 AND THAT FIENDS HUNG OUT IN EMPTY CAVES AND CASTLES
AUD0000000515_S0001724 HIS GAMBLE HADN'T PAID OFF ANY MORE THAN PERFIDION'S HAD
AUD0000000515_S0001729 HE SWALLOWED FOR SOME REASON HIS THROAT FELT TIGHT
AUD0000000515_S0001735 FOR WHEN I ESPIED YE AND ME AND EASY MONEY IN THE PASSAGE I DID SUFFER A GREAT DISCOMFIT
AUD0000000515_S0001741 THE DENT WAS NOT A DEEP ONE

AUD0000000515_S0001782 THE WHILE LEAVING IT IN PRETTY MUCH THE SAME LOCALE
AUD0000000515_S0001789 WARWICKSHIRE
AUD0000000515_S0001794 PERFIDION
AUD0000000515_S0001801 MALLORY SAW THAT THE LUMILLUSION PANEL HAD BEEN PRE-PROGRAMMED TO MATERIALIZE THE YORE AS A FIFTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLISH CASTLE
AUD0000000515_S0001806 AT LEAST THERE WAS NO SMOG IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
AUD0000000515_S0001811 WAS HE THE SIR THOMAS MALORY WHO HAD COMPILED AND TRANSLATED AND WRITTEN LE MORTE D'ARTHUR
AUD0000000515_S0001818 HOW IN THE WORLD WAS HE GOING TO GET FIVE HUNDRED CHAPTERS OF SEMI-HISTORICAL DATA TOGETHER AND PASS THEM OFF AS LE MORTE D'ARTHUR

AUD0000000515_S0001856 THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU TO WOT
AUD0000000515_S0001862 AND ITS STYLE AND FLAVOR HAD BEEN ARBITRARILY DETERMINED
AUD0000000515_S0001868 AND AS FOR THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO THE ENDEAVOR HIS TWENTY-SECOND CENTURY CYNICISM THAT HAD BEEN OBVIATED DURING HIS ENCOUNTER WITH SIR GALAHAD
AUD0000000515_S0001874 I KNOW WE HAVEN'T KNOWN EACH OTHER VERY LONG IN ONE SENSE ROWENA
AUD0000000515_S0001879 THEN HER PLUM-BLUE EYES SHOWED HOW TRULY BLUE THEY COULD BECOME AND SHE THREW HER ARMS AROUND HIS GORGET
AUD0000000515_S0001884 AS ALSO ALL THE NOBLE ACTS AND HEROICKE DEEDS OF HIS VALIANT KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE
AUD0000000521_S0000010 SO AT SUCH TIMES AS THERE HAPPENS TO BE TWICE THE USUAL NUMBER OF SENSIBLE ELECTORS
AUD0000000521_S0000015 ONCE HE WAS CROWNED THEY COULD GET HIM AS OFTEN AS THEY PLEASED BUT BEFORE THIS CEREMONY THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY

AUD0000000521_S0000041 BUT HAD FOLLOWED HIM BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF FAIRYLAND INTO HIS OWN PRIVATE HOUSE IN LONDON
AUD0000000521_S0000046 BUT THAT HE MUST HAVE OVERLOOKED THEM SOMEHOW AT HIS LATE CORONATION IF INDEED THEY HAD BEEN PRESENT FOR HE COULD NOT RECOLLECT THAT HE HAD SEEN ANYTHING JUST LIKE THEM BEFORE
AUD0000000521_S0000052 STARTED UP
AUD0000000521_S0000057 THEN THE KING OF FAIRYLAND HAD SOME TEA AND DRY TOAST
AUD0000000521_S0000063 THE FIGURES GREW AS BLACK AND AS MAD IN THEIR GAMBOLS AS EVER
AUD0000000521_S0000070 TOO TIRED TO PAY LONGER ATTENTION TO THEIR GAMES
AUD0000000521_S0000076 UPON WHICH

AUD0000000521_S0000086 ANSWERED THE KING
AUD0000000521_S0000092 I SUPPOSE YOU REALLY BELONG TO THE FIRE BRIGADE AT LEAST YOU KEEP PUTTING ITS LIGHT OUT
AUD0000000521_S0000097 WHY YOU DO NOTHING BUT JEST
AUD0000000521_S0000102 BUT PERHAPS YOUR MAJESTY DOES NOT SEE US DISTINCTLY
AUD0000000521_S0000107 HE DREW IT LIGHTLY BUT CAREFULLY ACROSS THE RIDGE OF HIS FOREHEAD
AUD0000000521_S0000112 HE HAD INVOLUNTARILY CLOSED HIS EYES DURING THE OPERATION
AUD0000000521_S0000117 TILL HE COULD NOT EXACTLY SEE WHERE THE WALLS WERE AND ALL ABOUT IT STOOD THE SHADOWS MOTIONLESS
AUD0000000521_S0000122 FROM WHICH HUNG LARGE LOOSE FEET

AUD0000000521_S0000142 DO THEY ALWAYS GO TO CHURCH BEFORE THEY GO TO WORK
AUD0000000521_S0000152 WHICH SEEMED TO BE THEIR MODE OF LAUGHING
AUD0000000521_S0000158 STRUGGLING WITH THE HEAPS OF DARKNESS THAT TRIED TO QUENCH IT AND THE HEAVENS FULL OF STARS FLASHING AND SPARKLING LIKE LIVE JEWELS
AUD0000000521_S0000164 AND COULD HARDLY BREATHE FOR THE SENSE OF EMPTINESS AND DESOLATION THAT FELL UPON HIM
AUD0000000521_S0000169 WALKING IN A DOUBLE ROW
AUD0000000521_S0000174 THEY STILL CARRIED THE BIER OR LITTER
AUD0000000521_S0000179 THE OUTERMOST SKIN SPARKLED WITH FROST
AUD0000000521_S0000184 AND WRAPPING IT ROUND THE KING LAID HIM ON THE LITTER IN THE MIDST OF THE FURS
AUD0000000521_S0000189 AS HE PASSED THE MIRROR HE SAW THAT HE WAS COVERED WITH ROYAL ERMINE
AUD0000000521_S0000194 LIKE THE SALAMANDRINE ESSENCE OF ALL THE CHRISTMAS FIRES OVER THE WORLD
AUD0000000521_S0000199 BUT MORE ETHEREAL THAN THOSE THAT BORE HIM
AUD0000000521_S0000205 IN A STRAIGHT LINE TOWARDS THE NORTH
AUD0000000521_S0000210 THEY CLIMBED THE HIGH MOUNTAINS
AUD0000000521_S0000216 AND BETWEEN THE STARS AND HIM NOTHING BUT AN EMPTINESS
AUD0000000521_S0000221 AND THE EMERALD AND SAPPHIRE EYES OF THE WILD BEASTS KEPT THE FROSTS FROM SETTLING UPON HIS LITTER
AUD0000000521_S0000226 THE DIAMOND IN HIS SCEPTRE BEGAN TO SHINE AND GLOW AND FLASH
AUD0000000521_S0000232 ONCE
AUD0000000521_S0000237 SHRANK AND SHIVERED AND NEARLY VANISHED
AUD0000000521_S0000242 BUT HE SOON FOUND THAT AMONGST THE SHGADOWS A MAN MUST LEARN NEVER TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING FOR IF HE DOES NOT HE WILL SOON GROW QUITE STUPID IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ENDLESS RECURRENCE OF SURPRISES
AUD0000000521_S0000248 THE AURORA BOREALIS WAS SHIVERING AND FLASHING LIKE A BATTLE OF TEN THOUSAND SPEARS
AUD0000000521_S0000253 BUT AS THE NORTHERN LIGHTS IN THE SKY ABOVE SO WAVERED AND QUIVERED
AUD0000000521_S0000258 TO VANISH BEYOND THEM
AUD0000000521_S0000264 THE KING'S BODY-GUARD SET DOWN THE LITTER UPON A ROCK
AUD0000000521_S0000269 RESPECTFULLY BUT FEARLESSLY AND SURE NEVER SUCH A GROTESQUE ASSEMBLY REVEALED ITSELF BEFORE TO MORTAL EYES
AUD0000000521_S0000275 INEXPLICABLY PERCEPTIBLE THROUGH EVERY CHANGE
AUD0000000521_S0000280 ANSWERED SEVERAL VOICES AT ONCE

AUD0000000521_S0000290 AS IF OVERMASTERING THEIR FEELINGS
AUD0000000521_S0000295 AND MADE HIMSELF SPOKESMAN FOR THEM DURING THE REMAINING PART OF THE DIALOGUE
AUD0000000521_S0000300 REPLIED THE KING
AUD0000000521_S0000305 WE DO NOT OFTEN APPEAR TO MEN
AUD0000000521_S0000310 AND ONLY BY A PASSING CHILL DO MEN RECOGNIZE AN UNKNOWN PRESENCE
AUD0000000521_S0000315 OR WHEN ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE ALL FEELING THE SAME THING AT ONCE MAKING THEM ONE
AUD0000000521_S0000320 ANSWERED THE SHADOW

AUD0000000521_S0000352 CHIEFLY OLD FARM-HOUSES
AUD0000000521_S0000357 AND IN THE HEARTS OF ITS INHABITANTS
AUD0000000521_S0000362 WE SELDOM SEEK TO FRIGHTEN ANYBODY
AUD0000000521_S0000367 SAID THE SHADOW
AUD0000000521_S0000372 AND HIS LIP QUIVERED
AUD0000000521_S0000377 THAT OUR BODIES ARE SUBJECT TO ALL THE VAGARIES OF ELEMENTAL INFLUENCES
AUD0000000521_S0000383 BUT LET THE WORLDLY MAN OR THE FRIVOLOUS WOMAN AND THEN
AUD0000000521_S0000388 AND THE KING FOLLOWING THEIR GAZE
AUD0000000521_S0000393 WE MUST BE GONE
AUD0000000521_S0000398 IN WHICH WE REPORT TO OUR CHIEFS THE THINGS WE HAVE ATTEMPTED
AUD0000000521_S0000403 ERE THE SHADOW COULD REPLY
AUD0000000521_S0000409 THERE THE KING LAY
AUD0000000521_S0000414 AND RALPH COMING SLOWLY TO HIMSELF
AUD0000000521_S0000419 SAID MRS RINKELMANN BETWEEN HER AND HERSELF
AUD0000000521_S0000424 RESPONDED HIS WIFE
AUD0000000521_S0000429 AND COVERED THE WHOLE ROOM
AUD0000000521_S0000434 FOR I HAPPEN TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE SHADOWS TOO AND I KNOW THAT IF HE HAD TOLD HIS WIFE ALL ABOUT IT JUST THEN
AUD0000000521_S0000439 THE WHOLE CHAMBER WAS FULL OF MYSTERY
AUD0000000521_S0000444 AS A FALSE VISION WOULD HAVE DONE
AUD0000000521_S0000449 AS THE TWILIGHT WAS GROWING DUSKY
AUD0000000521_S0000454 BUT THE DARKNESS GREW DEEPER AND DEEPER
AUD0000000521_S0000460 AND MRS RINKELMANN RUSHED UPSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER
AUD0000000521_S0000466 REPLIED THE WARDERS
AUD0000000521_S0000471 SLIPPED UPSTAIRS INTO THE NURSERY AND HAS NO DOUBT
AUD0000000521_S0000476 YOU MIGHT PUT THE CHILD BESIDE ITSELF
AUD0000000521_S0000481 GO AWAY
AUD0000000521_S0000487 WHEN SHE FEELS IN DANGER OF HATING OR ENVYING ANYONE
AUD0000000521_S0000492 THE SHADOWS WENT THROUGH THE SAME CEREMONIES AND PREPARATIONS AS BEFORE DURING WHICH
AUD0000000521_S0000498 HE VANISHED THROUGH THE NURSERY DOOR
AUD0000000521_S0000504 WHEN THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE MOUNTAIN-LAKE THE KING SAW THAT IT WAS CROWDED OVER ITS WHOLE SURFACE WITH A CHANGEFUL INTERMINGLING OF SHADOWS
AUD0000000521_S0000509 BUT ON THE STILTS OF HIS OWN LEGS ELONGATED FOR THE NONCE
AUD0000000521_S0000514 MANY HOWEVER AS THE WORDS WERE THAT PASSED ON ALL SIDES
AUD0000000521_S0000519 HE DIRECTED HIS ATTENTION
AUD0000000521_S0000524 FOR AS THE SHADOWS HAVE NO WRITING OR PRINTING
AUD0000000521_S0000529 LISTEN TO THEIR ADVENTURES AND HEAR GENERALLY WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY
AUD0000000521_S0000539 AS IF NO ONE WAS THERE OF OTHER KIND OR OF HIGHER RANK THAN THEMSELVES
AUD0000000521_S0000544 I WILL RECORD SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE KING HEARD
AUD0000000521_S0000549 BUT WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF THAT
AUD0000000521_S0000556 I COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE THE PITIABLE MISERY HE WAS IN
AUD0000000521_S0000563 HE KNOWS
AUD0000000521_S0000569 ONLY BY MAKING A LITTLE COFFIN ON THE WALL
AUD0000000521_S0000574 THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KISSING A LIVING CHILD
AUD0000000521_S0000579 HOW
AUD0000000521_S0000584 AND I DO NOT THINK THEY WILL BE
AUD0000000521_S0000589 QUITE THE CONTRARY
AUD0000000521_S0000594 OF HER WHOLE FACE
AUD0000000521_S0000599 POUTING LIPS PROJECTING CHIN
AUD0000000521_S0000604 OVER HIS MAGNUM OF PORT
AUD0000000521_S0000609 AND THEN I GAVE HIM A FUNERAL SERVICE
AUD0000000521_S0000614 I BELIEVE HE ACTUALLY DRANK A CUP OF TEA AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE OFTEN LOOKED IN SINCE
AUD0000000521_S0000619 HUMPH HUMPH HUMPH
AUD0000000521_S0000624 YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO MAKE GAME OF ANYONE
AUD0000000521_S0000630 OUT AMONGST THE FACES IN THE STREETS
AUD0000000521_S0000635 GUESS AGAIN
AUD0000000521_S0000640 AND I MADE SUCH FUN OF HIM ONE NIGHT ON THE WALL
AUD0000000521_S0000645 AND THOUGHT A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HIS PEOPLE
AUD0000000521_S0000650 BEFORE THE KING COULD REPLY
AUD0000000521_S0000656 IT IS THE MORE NEEDFUL THAT WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN
AUD0000000521_S0000661 THEN AGAIN
AUD0000000521_S0000667 DEAR SHADOW WHOM I LOVE NOW WITH ALL MY SHADOWY SOUL
AUD0000000521_S0000673 WHERE WE BURY ONLY OUR DEAD SELVES
AUD0000000521_S0000680 I WILL TELL YOU THE AWFUL FATE OF ONE SHADOW WHO REBELLED AGAINST HIS NATURE
AUD0000000521_S0000685 AND HE NEVER FORGOT HIS DREAM
AUD0000000521_S0000690 INSTEAD OF CONTINUING TO BE SHADOWS
AUD0000000521_S0000696 BROTHER SHADES
AUD0000000521_S0000701 AND PITIED THE POOR SHADOWS FAR MORE THAN THEY PITIED MEN
AUD0000000521_S0000707 BUT HE TOOK HIS REVENGE ON US
AUD0000000521_S0000712 WE COULD NOT STOP BUT WENT ON DANCING AND DANCING AFTER THE MUSIC
AUD0000000521_S0000717 HE HAD BEEN VERY MISERABLE ALL DAY HE WAS SO POOR AND WE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY WAY OF COMFORTING HIM EXCEPT MAKING HIM LAUGH
AUD0000000521_S0000725 I SAW THE TROUBLE HE WAS IN
AUD0000000521_S0000730 ROARING WITH LAUGHTER AT US
AUD0000000521_S0000736 I HAVE ONLY DONE ONE THING WORTH TELLING EVER SINCE WE MET LAST
AUD0000000521_S0000742 SOON AFTER CHRISTMAS-DAY
AUD0000000521_S0000747 I FOUND THAT THEY BELONGED TO A LITTLE BOY WHO LAY VERY STILL ON A SOFA
AUD0000000521_S0000753 THERE IS NO HELP FOR THAT BUT MAMMA
AUD0000000521_S0000758 HE WAS RATHER FRIGHTENED AT FIRST BUT HE WAS A BRAVE BOY
AUD0000000521_S0000763 HE ALWAYS BEGAN AGAIN WITH ME AND ON WE WENT WITH THE WILDEST GAMES
AUD0000000521_S0000769 I WAS WELL REPAID FOR MY TROUBLE BY HEARING HIS MOTHER SAY TO HIM WHY CHARLIE MY DEAR
AUD0000000521_S0000775 I CREPT ALONG THE WALL AND LOOKED IN AT THE DINING-ROOM WINDOW
AUD0000000521_S0000780 AND I HEARD THE SOUNDS OF A MINGLING KISS AND SOB
AUD0000000521_S0000785 LOOKING ABOUT IN A GREAT CITY
AUD0000000521_S0000790 IT WAS TOO GOOD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE LOST
AUD0000000521_S0000795 TO BE SURE IT WAS MOSTLY EXTEMPORIZED BUT I MANAGED TO KEEP IT IN HARMONY BY SINGING THIS SONG
AUD0000000521_S0000803 THUS WE GO TO AND FRO HERE AND THERE EVERYWHERE

AUD0000000521_S0000855 WHERE A MISER LAY APPARENTLY DYING
AUD0000000521_S0000860 ESPECIALLY CABINETS CHESTS AND PRESSES
AUD0000000521_S0000866 THOUGH HE NEARLY FELL DOWN WITH THE EFFORT
AUD0000000521_S0000871 HE SLAMMED THE LID DOWN AND I RECOVERED
AUD0000000521_S0000876 OF WHICH THERE WERE PLENTY TO CHOOSE FROM
AUD0000000521_S0000882 I SAW HER TAKE A LITTLE PHIAL FROM HER BOSOM
AUD0000000521_S0000888 THERE WAS YET BUT ONE SMALL PART OF THE CEILING SUITABLE FOR CASTING MYSELF UPON IN THE SHAPE I WISHED TO ASSUME
AUD0000000521_S0000893 THREW MYSELF UPON IT
AUD0000000521_S0000898 I MADE THE HANDLE OF THE SPOON WITH MY OWN NOSE HA HA

AUD0000000521_S0000932 ONLY YOU HAD SO MANY SHADOW-REMARKS TO MAKE
AUD0000000521_S0000937 BECAUSE SHE HAD MARRIED AGAINST HIS WILL
AUD0000000521_S0000942 AS HE LAY AWAKE THAT NIGHT I SAW THE WORDS ON HIS FACE HOW SHALL I GET RID OF THAT OLD DEVIL
AUD0000000521_S0000948 AND I STOOD WATCHING HIM FROM A DARK CORNER
AUD0000000521_S0000953 A SAD-FACED BUT BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
AUD0000000521_S0000958 AND NO WONDER
AUD0000000521_S0000963 LAST CHRISTMAS-DAY
AUD0000000521_S0000969 AND HASTENING TO IT

AUD0000000521_S0000980 AND CUT WONDERFUL CAPERS OF WELCOME
AUD0000000521_S0000985 WHEN SHE TOOK HER LAST LOOK AT THE PHANTOM IN THE GLASS
AUD0000000521_S0000991 AND SOON FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS A DISTANT RELATION AND A GREAT FAVOURITE OF THE GENTLEMAN OF THE HOUSE
AUD0000000521_S0000996 AND DOWN WE HURRIED
AUD0000000521_S0001001 WE LAY IN WAIT FOR HIM AT EVERY CORNER

AUD0000000521_S0001090 AND OF ALL THE INGRATITUDE HE HAD MET WITH
AUD0000000521_S0001096 A TINY FIGURE IN A LONG NIGHT-GOWN
AUD0000000521_S0001102 WHO NOW STOOD LOOKING FOR HER GRANDFATHER AMONG THE SHADOWS
AUD0000000521_S0001107 AND WALKED UP TO HIM WITH A CHILDISH STATELINESS

AUD0000000521_S0001150 AND FOUND OURSELVES FLOATING HIGH ABOVE THE TOWERS OF THE PALACE
AUD0000000521_S0001155 WITH HUMAN FACES AND EYES MOVING ABOUT AMONGST THE CROWD
AUD0000000521_S0001160 AND WHAT THEIR EYES SAID TO HIM

AUD0000000613_S0000011 THEY RESEMBLE THOSE PICTURESQUE MORSELS OF GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE WHICH WE SEE CRUMBLING IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
AUD0000000613_S0000020 THE SERVICES OF THE CHURCH ABOUT THIS SEASON ARE EXTREMELY TENDER AND INSPIRING
AUD0000000613_S0000025 I DO NOT KNOW A GRANDER EFFECT OF MUSIC ON THE MORAL FEELINGS THAN TO HEAR THE FULL CHOIR AND THE PEALING ORGAN PERFORMING A CHRISTMAS ANTHEM IN A CATHEDRAL

AUD0000000613_S0000054 HEART CALLETH UNTO HEART
AUD0000000613_S0000059 AND LIGHTS UP EACH COUNTENANCE INTO A KINDLIER WELCOME
AUD0000000613_S0000067 IT IS INSPIRING TO READ EVEN THE DRY DETAILS WHICH SOME ANTIQUARIANS HAVE GIVEN OF THE QUAINT HUMOURS
AUD0000000613_S0000072 AND BLENDED ALL RANKS IN ONE WARM GENEROUS FLOW OF JOY AND KINDNESS
AUD0000000613_S0000077 AND JOIN THE GOSSIP KNOT HUDDLED AROUND THE HEARTH
AUD0000000613_S0000082 BUT CERTAINLY A LESS CHARACTERISTIC SURFACE
AUD0000000613_S0000087 WHICH HAVE FURNISHED POETRY WITH ITS RICHEST MATERIALS AND THE DRAMA WITH ITS MOST ATTRACTIVE VARIETY OF CHARACTERS AND MANNERS
AUD0000000613_S0000092 SOCIETY HAS ACQUIRED A MORE ENLIGHTENED AND ELEGANT TONE
AUD0000000613_S0000097 ITS FEUDAL HOSPITALITIES AND LORDLY WASSAILINGS

AUD0000000613_S0000140 MAY HAVE HIS MOMENTS OF STRONG EXCITEMENT AND SELFISH GRATIFICATION
AUD0000000613_S0000152 IN THE PRECEDING PAPER I HAVE MADE SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES OF ENGLAND
AUD0000000613_S0000157 IN THE COURSE OF A DECEMBER TOUR IN YORKSHIRE
AUD0000000613_S0000162 WHO BY THEIR TALK SEEMED PRINCIPALLY BOUND TO THE MANSIONS OF RELATIONS OR FRIENDS TO EAT THE CHRISTMAS DINNER
AUD0000000613_S0000168 AND PROMISING THEMSELVES A WORLD OF ENJOYMENT
AUD0000000613_S0000173 THEY WERE FULL OF ANTICIPATIONS OF THE MEETING WITH THE FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLD
AUD0000000613_S0000178 HOW HE COULD TROT
AUD0000000613_S0000183 WHENEVER AN OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED
AUD0000000613_S0000188 AND HAD A LARGE BUNCH OF CHRISTMAS GREENS STUCK IN THE BUTTON-HOLE OF HIS COAT
AUD0000000613_S0000193 IT MAY NOT BE UNACCEPTABLE TO MY UNTRAVELLED READERS TO HAVE A SKETCH THAT MAY SERVE AS A GENERAL REPRESENTATION OF THIS VERY NUMEROUS AND IMPORTANT CLASS OF FUNCTIONARIES WHO HAVE A DRESS
AUD0000000613_S0000199 WHEREVER AN ENGLISH STAGE-COACHMAN MAY BE SEEN
AUD0000000613_S0000204 HE IS SWELLED INTO JOLLY DIMENSIONS BY FREQUENT POTATIONS OF MALT LIQUORS
AUD0000000613_S0000209 KNOWINGLY KNOTTED AND TUCKED IN AT THE BOSOM
AUD0000000613_S0000214 THERE IS STILL DISCERNIBLE THAT NEATNESS AND PROPRIETY OF PERSON WHICH IS ALMOST INHERENT IN AN ENGLISHMAN
AUD0000000613_S0000220 AND ABANDONS THE CATTLE TO THE CARE OF THE HOSTLER HIS DUTY BEING MERELY TO DRIVE FROM ONE STAGE TO ANOTHER
AUD0000000613_S0000225 SHOE-BLACKS
AUD0000000613_S0000231 EVERY RAGAMUFFIN THAT HAS A COAT TO HIS BACK THRUSTS HIS HANDS IN THE POCKETS
AUD0000000613_S0000236 THAT I FANCIED I SAW CHEERFULNESS IN EVERY COUNTENANCE THROUGHOUT THE JOURNEY
AUD0000000613_S0000241 AND IN THE HURRY OF THE MOMENT CAN HARDLY TAKE LEAVE OF THE GROUP THAT ACCOMPANIES THEM
AUD0000000613_S0000246 HANDS TO SOME HALF-BLUSHING HALF-LAUGHING HOUSEMAID AN ODD-SHAPED BILLET-DOUX FROM SOME RUSTIC ADMIRER
AUD0000000613_S0000252 TO WHOM THE PASSING OF THE COACH IS AN EVENT FRUITFUL OF MUCH SPECULATION
AUD0000000613_S0000257 LABOURING AT THE BELLOWS
AUD0000000613_S0000262 FOR IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF EVERYBODY WAS IN GOOD LOOKS AND GOOD SPIRITS
AUD0000000613_S0000269 BEGAN TO APPEAR AT THE WINDOWS
AUD0000000613_S0000274 SUGAR AND HONEY
AUD0000000613_S0000279 THE COUNTRY MAID LEAVES HALF HER MARKET AND MUST BE SENT AGAIN IF SHE FORGETS A PACK OF CARDS ON CHRISTMAS EVE
AUD0000000613_S0000284 I WAS ROUSED FROM THIS FIT OF LUXURIOUS MEDITATION BY A SHOUT FROM MY LITTLE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS
AUD0000000613_S0000289 AND THERE'S OLD CARLO
AUD0000000613_S0000295 A LITTLE OLD RAT OF A PONY WITH A SHAGGY MANE AND LONG RUSTY TAIL
AUD0000000613_S0000300 BUT BANTAM WAS THE GREAT OBJECT OF INTEREST ALL WANTED TO MOUNT AT ONCE AND IT WAS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY THAT JOHN ARRANGED THAT THEY SHOULD RIDE BY TURNS
AUD0000000613_S0000305 AND OVERPOWERING HIM BY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOME
AUD0000000613_S0000310 AND A HOLIDAY WAS THE SUMMIT OF EARTHLY FELICITY
AUD0000000613_S0000315 WITH BANTAM CARLO AND OLD JOHN
AUD0000000613_S0000320 IN THE EVENING WE REACHED A VILLAGE WHERE I HAD DETERMINED TO PASS THE NIGHT
AUD0000000613_S0000325 THAT PICTURE OF CONVENIENCE
AUD0000000613_S0000330 HUNG ROUND WITH COPPER AND TIN VESSELS
AUD0000000613_S0000336 WITH A COLD ROUND OF BEEF AND OTHER HEARTY VIANDS UPON IT
AUD0000000613_S0000341 BUSTLING LANDLADY BUT STILL SEIZING AN OCCASIONAL MOMENT TO EXCHANGE A FLIPPANT WORD
AUD0000000613_S0000346 MERRY HOST
AUD0000000613_S0000352 I HAD NOT BEEN LONG AT THE INN WHEN A POSTCHAISE DROVE UP TO THE DOOR

AUD0000000613_S0000372 I CLOSED THEREFORE AT ONCE WITH HIS INVITATION THE CHAISE DROVE UP TO THE DOOR AND IN A FEW MOMENTS I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE FAMILY MANSION OF THE BRACEBRIDGES
AUD0000000613_S0000383 BUT EXTREMELY COLD OUR CHAISE WHIRLED RAPIDLY OVER THE FROZEN GROUND THE POST-BOY SMACKED HIS WHIP INCESSANTLY
AUD0000000613_S0000390 THAT THE STRONG RICH PECULIARITIES OF ANCIENT RURAL LIFE ARE ALMOST POLISHED AWAY
AUD0000000613_S0000396 WHO HAVE TREATED ON THE SUBJECT
AUD0000000613_S0000404 BEING REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OLDEST FAMILY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND A GREAT PART OF THE PEASANTRY BEING HIS TENANTS
AUD0000000613_S0000412 THE HUGE SQUARE COLUMNS THAT SUPPORTED THE GATE WERE SURMOUNTED BY THE FAMILY CREST
AUD0000000613_S0000417 AS THE MOONLIGHT FELL STRONGLY UPON HER I HAD FULL VIEW OF A LITTLE PRIMITIVE DAME DRESSED VERY MUCH IN THE ANTIQUE TASTE
AUD0000000613_S0000423 WHILE THE CHAISE SHOULD FOLLOW ON
AUD0000000613_S0000429 SAID HE HAVE I SCAMPERED UP THIS AVENUE ON RETURNING HOME ON SCHOOL VACATIONS
AUD0000000613_S0000434 HE WAS VERY PARTICULAR THAT WE SHOULD PLAY THE OLD ENGLISH GAMES ACCORDING TO THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND CONSULTED OLD BOOKS FOR PRECEDENT AND AUTHORITY FOR EVERY MERRIE DISPORT YET I ASSURE YOU THERE NEVER WAS PEDANTRY SO DELIGHTFUL
AUD0000000613_S0000441 AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS SURROUNDED AND ALMOST OVERPOWERED BY THE CARESSES OF THE FAITHFUL ANIMALS
AUD0000000613_S0000446 WITH HEAVY STONE-SHAFTED BOW WINDOWS JUTTING OUT AND OVERRUN WITH IVY
AUD0000000613_S0000451 THE GROUNDS ABOUT THE HOUSE WERE LAID OUT IN THE OLD FORMAL MANNER OF ARTIFICIAL FLOWER-BEDS CLIPPED SHRUBBERIES RAISED TERRACES
AUD0000000613_S0000456 AND BEFITTING GOOD OLD FAMILY STYLE
AUD0000000613_S0000462 THE SQUIRE WAS GLAD OF ANY ARGUMENT TO DEFEND HIS CLIPPED YEW-TREES AND FORMAL TERRACES
AUD0000000613_S0000467 MUST PROCEED FROM THE SERVANTS' HALL
AUD0000000613_S0000473 SO INTENT WERE THE SERVANTS UPON THEIR SPORTS
AUD0000000613_S0000479 WHICH WAS ASSEMBLED IN A LARGE OLD-FASHIONED HALL
AUD0000000613_S0000485 SHOWED TRACES OF A TROOP OF LITTLE FAIRY BEINGS
AUD0000000613_S0000490 I HAVE CALLED IT A HALL
AUD0000000613_S0000496 THE FURNITURE WAS OF THE CUMBROUS WORKMANSHIP OF FORMER DAYS THOUGH SOME ARTICLES OF MODERN CONVENIENCE HAD BEEN ADDED
AUD0000000613_S0000501 IT WAS REALLY DELIGHTFUL TO SEE THE OLD SQUIRE SEATED IN HIS HEREDITARY ELBOW-CHAIR BY THE HOSPITABLE FIRESIDE OF HIS ANCESTORS
AUD0000000613_S0000506 WAG HIS TAIL AGAINST THE FLOOR
AUD0000000613_S0000513 IT WAS SERVED UP IN A SPACIOUS OAKEN CHAMBER

AUD0000000613_S0000577 HAD LED OUT ONE OF HIS MAIDEN AUNTS
AUD0000000613_S0000583 FROM SEVERAL SHY GLANCES WHICH I HAD NOTICED IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING

AUD0000000613_S0000638 AND GIVE THE HONOUR TO THIS DAY THAT SEES DECEMBER TURN'D TO MAY
AUD0000000613_S0000643 WHEN I AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING IT SEEMED AS IF ALL THE EVENTS OF THE PRECEDING EVENING HAD BEEN A DREAM
AUD0000000613_S0000648 THE BURDEN OF WHICH WAS REJOICE OUR SAVIOUR HE WAS BORN ON CHRISTMAS DAY IN THE MORNING
AUD0000000613_S0000653 THEY WERE GOING THE ROUNDS OF THE HOUSE AND SINGING AT EVERY CHAMBER-DOOR BUT MY SUDDEN APPEARANCE FRIGHTENED THEM INTO MUTE BASHFULNESS

AUD0000000613_S0000679 WHERE I FOUND THE PRINCIPAL PART OF THE FAMILY ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN A KIND OF GALLERY
AUD0000000613_S0000685 THE EFFECT WAS EXTREMELY PLEASING BUT I WAS PARTICULARLY GRATIFIED BY THE EXALTATION OF HEART
AUD0000000613_S0000690 EITHER BY MR BRACEBRIDGE OR BY SOME MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
AUD0000000613_S0000695 OUR BREAKFAST CONSISTED OF WHAT THE SQUIRE DENOMINATED TRUE OLD ENGLISH FARE
AUD0000000613_S0000700 AFTER BREAKFAST I WALKED ABOUT THE GROUNDS WITH FRANK BRACEBRIDGE AND MASTER SIMON

AUD0000000613_S0000723 WE OUGHT TO ASCRIBE TO THIS BIRD BOTH UNDERSTANDING AND GLORY FOR BEING PRAISED
AUD0000000613_S0000729 WHO WAS EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO KEEP UP THE BREED PARTLY BECAUSE THEY BELONGED TO CHIVALRY
AUD0000000613_S0000735 HAVING AN APPOINTMENT AT THE PARISH CHURCH WITH THE VILLAGE CHORISTERS
AUD0000000613_S0000740 WHICH THE SQUIRE HAD PUT INTO HIS HANDS
AUD0000000613_S0000745 LIKE ALL MEN WHO KNOW BUT A FEW BOOKS
AUD0000000613_S0000750 AND ADAPTED TO TUNES THAT WERE POPULAR AMONG THE CHOICE SPIRITS OF THE LAST CENTURY
AUD0000000613_S0000755 IF YOU ARE DISPOSED TO GO TO CHURCH SAID FRANK BRACEBRIDGE
AUD0000000613_S0000761 AS THE MORNING THOUGH FROSTY WAS REMARKABLY FINE AND CLEAR
AUD0000000613_S0000766 THE FRONT OF IT WAS PERFECTLY MATTED WITH A YEW-TREE THAT HAD BEEN TRAINED AGAINST ITS WALLS
AUD0000000613_S0000772 WITH A GRIZZLED WIG THAT WAS TOO WIDE AND STOOD OFF FROM EACH EAR SO THAT HIS HEAD SEEMED TO HAVE SHRUNK AWAY WITHIN IT
AUD0000000613_S0000777 AND HAD RECEIVED THIS LIVING SHORTLY AFTER THE LATTER HAD COME TO HIS ESTATE
AUD0000000613_S0000782 HE HAD MADE DILIGENT INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE FESTIVE RITES AND HOLIDAY CUSTOMS OF FORMER TIMES AND HAD BEEN AS ZEALOUS IN THE INQUIRY AS IF HE HAD BEEN A BOON COMPANION BUT IT WAS MERELY WITH THAT PLODDING SPIRIT WITH WHICH MEN OF ADUST TEMPERAMENT FOLLOW UP ANY TRACK OF STUDY
AUD0000000613_S0000787 THAT THEY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN REFLECTED INTO HIS COUNTENANCE INDEED WHICH IF THE FACE BE AN INDEX OF THE MIND
AUD0000000613_S0000792 PROFANED BY HAVING BEEN USED BY THE DRUIDS IN THEIR MYSTIC CEREMONIES AND THOUGH IT MIGHT BE INNOCENTLY EMPLOYED IN THE FESTIVE ORNAMENTING OF HALLS AND KITCHENS
AUD0000000613_S0000797 THE INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH WAS VENERABLE BUT SIMPLE ON THE WALLS WERE SEVERAL MURAL MONUMENTS OF THE BRACEBRIDGES
AUD0000000613_S0000802 AND THE SAME WHOSE PICTURE HUNG OVER THE FIREPLACE IN THE HALL
AUD0000000613_S0000807 KEEPING HIS EYE FIXED INTENTLY ON THE CHOIR
AUD0000000613_S0000813 WHO PLAYED ON THE CLARIONET
AUD0000000613_S0000819 LIKE OLD CREMONA FIDDLES
AUD0000000613_S0000824 THE VOCAL PARTS GENERALLY LAGGING A LITTLE BEHIND THE INSTRUMENTAL
AUD0000000613_S0000829 UNLUCKILY THERE WAS A BLUNDER AT THE VERY OUTSET THE MUSICIANS BECAME FLURRIED MASTER SIMON WAS IN A FEVER EVERYTHING WENT ON LAMELY AND IRREGULARLY UNTIL THEY CAME TO A CHORUS BEGINNING NOW LET US SING WITH ONE ACCORD
AUD0000000613_S0000834 KEPT ON A QUAVERING COURSE
AUD0000000613_S0000839 AND THE PROPRIETY OF OBSERVING IT NOT MERELY AS A DAY OF THANKSGIVING BUT OF REJOICING SUPPORTING THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS OPINIONS BY THE EARLIEST USAGES OF THE CHURCH
AUD0000000613_S0000844 AND A CLOUD MORE OF SAINTS AND FATHERS FROM WHOM HE MADE COPIOUS QUOTATIONS
AUD0000000613_S0000850 SHUT UP AMONG WORM-EATEN TOMES IN THE RETIREMENT OF HIS ANTIQUATED LITTLE STUDY
AUD0000000613_S0000855 AND THE HOST OF IMAGINARY FOES WITH WHOM HE HAD TO COMBAT HAD A STUBBORN CONFLICT WITH OLD PRYNNE AND TWO OR THREE OTHER FORGOTTEN CHAMPIONS OF THE ROUND-HEADS ON THE SUBJECT OF CHRISTMAS FESTIVITY AND CONCLUDED BY URGING HIS HEARERS
AUD0000000613_S0000862 GREETING AND SHAKING HANDS AND THE CHILDREN RAN ABOUT CRYING ULE ULE
AUD0000000613_S0000867 AND WERE INVITED BY HIM TO THE HALL
AUD0000000613_S0000873 AS WE PASSED OVER A RISING GROUND WHICH COMMANDED SOMETHING OF A PROSPECT
AUD0000000613_S0000878 AND TO BRING OUT THE LIVING GREEN WHICH ADORNS AN ENGLISH LANDSCAPE EVEN IN MIDWINTER
AUD0000000613_S0000883 AN EMBLEM OF CHRISTMAS HOSPITALITY

AUD0000000613_S0000905 I THINK ONE MODE TO KEEP THEM IN GOOD HUMOUR IN THESE HARD TIMES WOULD BE FOR THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY TO PASS MORE TIME ON THEIR ESTATES
AUD0000000613_S0000911 AND MORE BEGGARS DRAWN INTO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IN ONE WEEK THAN THE PARISH OFFICERS COULD GET RID OF IN A YEAR
AUD0000000613_S0000916 A BAND OF COUNTRY LADS WITHOUT COATS
AUD0000000613_S0000921 FOLLOWED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF VILLAGERS AND PEASANTRY
AUD0000000613_S0000926 KEEPING EXACT TIME TO THE MUSIC WHILE ONE
AUD0000000613_S0000931 THE SQUIRE EYED THIS FANCIFUL EXHIBITION WITH GREAT INTEREST AND DELIGHT
AUD0000000613_S0000936 AFTER THE DANCE WAS CONCLUDED THE WHOLE PARTY WAS ENTERTAINED WITH BRAWN AND BEEF AND STOUT HOME-BREWED
AUD0000000613_S0000941 WITH MASTER SIMON HOWEVER THEY ALL SEEMED MORE AT THEIR EASE
AUD0000000613_S0000946 THERE IS SOMETHING GENUINE AND AFFECTIONATE IN THE GAIETY OF THE LOWER ORDERS WHEN IT IS EXCITED BY THE BOUNTY AND FAMILIARITY OF THOSE ABOVE THEM THE WARM GLOW OF GRATITUDE ENTERS INTO THEIR MIRTH
AUD0000000613_S0000952 THE WHOLE HOUSE INDEED SEEMED ABANDONED TO MERRIMENT
AUD0000000613_S0000957 I PERCEIVED A BAND OF WANDERING MUSICIANS

AUD0000000613_S0000975 AND EVERMORE BE MERRY

AUD0000000613_S0000986 PRESENTED AND AWAY
AUD0000000613_S0000991 AND THE FLAME WENT SPARKLING AND WREATHING UP THE WIDE-MOUTHED CHIMNEY
AUD0000000613_S0000996 THEY CERTAINLY HAVING THE STAMP OF MORE RECENT DAYS BUT I WAS TOLD THAT THE PAINTING HAD BEEN SO CONSIDERED TIME OUT OF MIND AND THAT AS TO THE ARMOUR
AUD0000000613_S0001002 GOBLETS BASINS AND EWERS THE GORGEOUS UTENSILS OF GOOD COMPANIONSHIP
AUD0000000613_S0001008 AND TWANGING HIS INSTRUMENT WITH A VAST DEAL MORE POWER THAN MELODY
AUD0000000613_S0001014 LEGITIMATELY HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
AUD0000000613_S0001019 OF STAID DEMEANOUR
AUD0000000613_S0001024 A BRACEBRIDGE ALL OVER
AUD0000000613_S0001030 THERE WAS NOW A PAUSE
AUD0000000613_S0001035 WHICH WAS PLACED WITH GREAT FORMALITY AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE
AUD0000000613_S0001042 I PRAY YOU ALL SYNGE MERILY QUI ESTIS IN CONVIVIO
AUD0000000613_S0001047 AND THE SOUND OF MINSTRELSY AND SONG
AUD0000000613_S0001052 AT WHICH I WAS EDUCATED
AUD0000000613_S0001057 AND WHO WAS ALWAYS MORE TAKEN UP WITH THE TEXT THAN THE SENTIMENT
AUD0000000613_S0001063 IN AN UNDER VOICE
AUD0000000613_S0001068 AS MINE HOST TERMED IT BEING AS HE ADDED
AUD0000000613_S0001073 AND WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY SOMETHING TRADITIONARY IN THEIR EMBELLISHMENTS BUT ABOUT WHICH
AUD0000000613_S0001078 THIS THE SQUIRE CONFESSED WITH SOME LITTLE HESITATION
AUD0000000613_S0001083 BY WHICH HE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO FOLLOW UP
AUD0000000613_S0001088 I WAS AMUSED TOO AT THE AIR OF PROFOUND GRAVITY WITH WHICH THE BUTLER AND OTHER SERVANTS EXECUTED THE DUTIES ASSIGNED THEM HOWEVER ECCENTRIC
AUD0000000613_S0001094 WHICH HE PLACED BEFORE THE SQUIRE
AUD0000000613_S0001100 WITH ROASTED APPLES BOBBING ABOUT THE SURFACE
AUD0000000613_S0001105 HE SENT IT BRIMMING AROUND THE BOARD
AUD0000000613_S0001110 AND WAS KISSED RATHER COYLY BY THE LADIES
AUD0000000613_S0001115 FILL STILL
AUD0000000613_S0001120 SING
AUD0000000613_S0001125 THERE WAS HOWEVER A GREAT DEAL OF RALLYING OF MASTER SIMON ABOUT SOME GAY WIDOW
AUD0000000613_S0001130 AT EVERY PAUSE IN THE GENERAL CONVERSATION HE RENEWED HIS BANTERING IN PRETTY MUCH THE SAME TERMS WINKING HARD AT ME WITH BOTH EYES WHENEVER HE GAVE MASTER SIMON WHAT HE CONSIDERED A HOME THRUST
AUD0000000613_S0001135 THE DINNER-TIME PASSED AWAY IN THIS FLOW OF INNOCENT HILARITY AND
AUD0000000613_S0001140 THE JOYOUS DISPOSITION OF THE WORTHY SQUIRE WAS PERFECTLY CONTAGIOUS HE WAS HAPPY HIMSELF
AUD0000000613_S0001145 BUT WHICH WOULD NOT EXACTLY DO FOR A LADY'S EAR AND THOUGH I CANNOT POSITIVELY AFFIRM THAT THERE WAS MUCH WIT UTTERED
AUD0000000613_S0001150 AND THE LAUGHTER ABUNDANT
AUD0000000613_S0001155 IN THE VIGOROUS ENJOYMENT OF PROSPERITY AND SUNSHINE
AUD0000000613_S0001161 AND AS THE SQUIRE HINTED AT A SLY STORY OF THE PARSON AND A PRETTY MILKMAID
AUD0000000613_S0001166 I HAVE RARELY MET WITH AN OLD GENTLEMAN WHO TOOK ABSOLUTELY OFFENCE AT THE IMPUTED GALLANTRIES OF HIS YOUTH
AUD0000000613_S0001171 HE EVEN GAVE A LONG SONG ABOUT THE WOOING OF A WIDOW WHICH HE INFORMED ME HE HAD GATHERED FROM AN EXCELLENT BLACK-LETTER WORK ENTITLED CUPID'S SOLICITOR FOR LOVE
AUD0000000613_S0001176 HE MUST MAKE HAY WHILE THE SUN DOTH SHINE HE MUST NOT STAND WITH HER SHALL I SHALL I
AUD0000000613_S0001181 THE PARSON TOO BEGAN TO SHOW THE EFFECTS OF GOOD CHEER
AUD0000000613_S0001186 AT THE PRIVATE INSTIGATION OF MINE HOST
AUD0000000613_S0001191 I DELIGHT IN WITNESSING THE GAMBOLS OF CHILDREN
AUD0000000613_S0001196 WHO WAS THE LEADER OF THEIR REVELS AND SEEMED ON ALL OCCASIONS TO FULFIL THE OFFICE OF THAT ANCIENT POTENTATE
AUD0000000613_S0001201 AND TICKLING HIM WITH STRAWS
AUD0000000613_S0001206 A COMPLETE PICTURE OF A ROMP
AUD0000000613_S0001211 WHEN I RETURNED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM I FOUND THE COMPANY SEATED AROUND THE FIRE LISTENING TO THE PARSON
AUD0000000613_S0001217 WITH WHICH HE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED IN THE COURSE OF HIS ANTIQUARIAN RESEARCHES
AUD0000000613_S0001222 HE GAVE US SEVERAL ANECDOTES OF THE FANCIES OF THE NEIGHBOURING PEASANTRY
AUD0000000613_S0001228 WHOSE COTTAGE BORDERED ON THE CHURCHYARD HAD SEEN IT
AUD0000000613_S0001233 SOME TALKED OF GOLD AND JEWELS BURIED IN THE TOMB
AUD0000000613_S0001238 THERE WERE MANY OF THE STOUTEST UNBELIEVERS THAT WERE SHY OF VENTURING ALONE IN THE FOOTPATH THAT LED ACROSS THE CHURCHYARD
AUD0000000613_S0001243 THE EYES OF THE WARRIOR WERE STILL FIXED ON YOU
AUD0000000613_S0001248 THE CRUSADER USED TO MOUNT HIS HORSE COME DOWN FROM HIS PICTURE
AUD0000000613_S0001253 HAD BEEN VERY MUCH COUNTENANCED BY THE SQUIRE WHO
AUD0000000613_S0001258 HE WAS HIMSELF A GREAT READER OF OLD LEGENDS AND ROMANCES
AUD0000000613_S0001264 WITH THE UPROAR OF MANY SMALL VOICES AND GIRLISH LAUGHTER
AUD0000000613_S0001269 HAD CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF A CHRISTMAS MUMMERY OR MASKING AND HAVING CALLED IN TO HIS ASSISTANCE THE OXONIAN AND THE YOUNG OFFICER
AUD0000000613_S0001274 AND THE WHOLE HAD BEEN BEDIZENED OUT
AUD0000000613_S0001280 AND MUST INDUBITABLY HAVE FIGURED IN THE DAYS OF THE COVENANTERS
AUD0000000613_S0001285 LONG STOMACHER
AUD0000000613_S0001290 NATURAL TO A YOUNG GALLANT IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS MISTRESS
AUD0000000613_S0001295 AND FULL-BOTTOMED WIGS
AUD0000000613_S0001301 THE IRRUPTION OF THIS MOTLEY CREW WITH BEAT OF DRUM ACCORDING TO ANCIENT CUSTOM WAS THE CONSUMMATION OF UPROAR AND MERRIMENT
AUD0000000613_S0001306 DIFFERENT CENTURIES WERE FIGURING AT CROSS HANDS AND RIGHT AND LEFT THE DARK AGES WERE CUTTING PIROUETTES AND RIGADOONS AND THE DAYS OF QUEEN BESS JIGGING MERRILY DOWN THE MIDDLE
AUD0000000613_S0001311 AND SCARCELY HEARING A WORD THE PARSON SAID
AUD0000000613_S0001316 AND OLD AGE THROWING OFF HIS APATHY
AUD0000000613_S0001321 MINGLED WITH ALL THIS REVELRY THAT GAVE IT A PECULIAR ZEST IT WAS SUITED TO THE TIME AND PLACE AND AS THE OLD MANOR HOUSE ALMOST REELED WITH MIRTH AND WASSAIL IT SEEMED ECHOING BACK THE JOVIALITY OF LONG-DEPARTED YEARS
AUD0000000613_S0001326 IS THERE NOT WISDOM ENOUGH EXTANT FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF THE WORLD
AUD0000000613_S0001331 BUT IN WRITING TO AMUSE
AUD0000000613_S0001336 PROMPT A BENEVOLENT VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE
AUD0000000613_S0001341 THE END
AUD0000000665_S0000019 I THOUGHT I WAS TALLER

AUD0000000665_S0000091 AND AUNT ADELINE AND I ARE NOT THAT WAY
AUD0000000665_S0000117 HILLSBORO IS LIKE THAT
AUD0000000665_S0000138 I DO THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL THE FAMILY I'VE GOT
AUD0000000665_S0000157 AND HER FAITHFUL HEART IS SO WRUNG WITH COMPASSION THAT SHE PERSPIRES ALMOST AS MUCH AS I DO
AUD0000000665_S0000181 BUT HOW COULD A MORTAL RESIST A PEEP INTO SUCH A FAIRY GARDEN IF HE SPIED THE QUEEN AND HER FAUN AT PLAY HE SAID IN A VOICE AS WONDERFUL AS THE SMILE
AUD0000000665_S0000203 I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU IN THE HOUSE
AUD0000000665_S0000219 HEARD MYSELF ANSWER HER AIRILY TO MY OWN ASTONISHMENT
AUD0000000665_S0000246 I ALMOST THOUGHT I DIDN'T QUITE LIKE IT
AUD0000000665_S0000264 WHAT COULD WE SAY WHAT COULD WE DO WE DIDN'T TRY
AUD0000000665_S0000296 THEY ARE LIKE THOSE SUMS IN ALGEBRA THAT YOU THINK ABOUT AND WORRY ABOUT AND CRY ABOUT AND TRY TO GET HELP FROM OTHER WOMEN ABOUT
AUD0000000665_S0000302 AFTER THE WHITE-DRESS JUDGE-WADE EPISODE THAT AUNT ADELINE HAD GONE TO ALL THE FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE STREET TO BE CONSOLED ABOUT
AUD0000000665_S0000307 DON'T YOU THINK IT IS VERY VERY LONELY TO BE A WIDOW MRS JOHNSON

AUD0000000665_S0000326 AND ALSO MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH I HAD GAINED ALL THE MORE THAN TWENTY POUNDS THAT I HAVE SLAVED OFF ME AND DOUBLED THEM ON AGAIN
AUD0000000665_S0000332 HE CAME DOWN TO CHERBOURG TO SEE ME OFF AND ALMOST THE LAST THING HE SAID TO ME WAS
AUD0000000665_S0000341 AND SHE DOES THEM BOTH MOST OF HER TIME
AUD0000000665_S0000346 BUT WHEN I DID I WAS IN THE PROPER GLOW ALL OVER
AUD0000000665_S0000353 YOU CAN'T ALWAYS BE SURE OF THE RIGHT ANSWER TO X IN ANY PROPOSITION OF LIFE THAT IS A WOMAN CAN'T
AUD0000000665_S0000358 STRANGE GIRL WHO COULD HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH A BUCKET HOOP IF SHE HAD TRIED HARD
AUD0000000665_S0000364 IT WAS BAD ENOUGH TO HEAR AUNT BETTIE JUST OFFER HER TOM WHO
AUD0000000665_S0000370 I ALMOST LOVED MRS JOHNSON WHEN SHE BIT OFF A THREAD VICIOUSLY AND SAID
AUD0000000665_S0000376 I WANT MOST AWFULLY TO HUG HER VERY SLIMNESS
AUD0000000665_S0000383 AFTER THIS I SHALL ALWAYS APPRECIATE AND ADMIRE HIM FOR THE WAY HE MADE MONEY
AUD0000000665_S0000389 IT WAS DELICIOUS
AUD0000000665_S0000397 FROM THE HORROR I FELT WHEN I LOOKED AT MYSELF
AUD0000000665_S0000404 THE ONE FOR ME MUST HAVE LOOKED TO HER LIKE A BIG TRANSACTION
AUD0000000665_S0000410 FOR WHEN I BLUSHED AND ASKED HER IF SHE COULD RECOMMEND A GOOD BEAUTY DOCTOR SHE HELD UP HER HANDS AND SHUDDERED
AUD0000000665_S0000417 HE ONLY SAID POLITELY
AUD0000000665_S0000422 YES THE WORD TROUSSEAU OUGHT TO HAVE A DEFINITE SURNAME AFTER IT ALWAYS
AUD0000000665_S0000431 BECAUSE I REALLY OUGHT TO HAVE STAYED A DAY LONGER TO BUY THAT MONUMENT BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH I WANTED TO SEE BILLY SO DESPERATELY THAT HIS SLEEP-PLACE ABOVE MY HEART HURT AS IF IT MIGHT HAVE PRICKLY HEAT BREAK OUT AT ANY MINUTE
AUD0000000665_S0000439 AT THAT MINUTE THE NOBLE BLACK-SILK DEED FELT FOOLISH BUT AT THE NEXT MINUTE I WAS GLAD I HAD DONE IT
AUD0000000665_S0000445 I TURNED WITH AN ECHO SMILE ALL OVER ME
AUD0000000665_S0000451 SO THAT I COULD HAVE OFFERED YOU SOME ASSISTANCE IN YOUR SELECTION
AUD0000000665_S0000457 WHAT IS A WOMAN GOING TO SAY WHEN SHE HAS A TOMBSTONE THROWN IN HER FACE LIKE THAT

AUD0000000665_S0000479 SUPPOSE SHE HAD SEEN OR HEARD
AUD0000000665_S0000485 HE FINALLY KISSED UNDER MY RIGHT EAR
AUD0000000665_S0000490 WILL THAT BE ENOUGH
AUD0000000665_S0000499 HE VERY FAR FROM KISSED THE HAND HE HELD IT JUST LONG ENOUGH TO TURN ME ROUND INTO THE LIGHT AND GIVE ME ONE LONG LOOKING-OVER FROM HEAD TO FEET
AUD0000000665_S0000505 LOOKING INTO HIS FACE AS THOUGH I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE

AUD0000000665_S0000540 JANE I SAID LOOKING PAST HER HEAD
AUD0000000665_S0000546 JANE UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING I SAY TO HER
AUD0000000665_S0000552 I COULDN'T EVEN TAKE VERY MUCH INTEREST IN THE LONELY EGG ON THE LONELY SLICE OF DRY TOAST
AUD0000000665_S0000558 I ROLLED OVER AND LAUGHED INTO MY PILLOW
AUD0000000665_S0000565 OR HEAR SOME MASCULINE VOICE IN HER FRONT GARDEN
AUD0000000665_S0000570 I DON'T INTEND TO RUN ANY RISK OF LOSING MY FRIENDS THAT WAY
AUD0000000665_S0000578 THEN JUST AS I HAD GOT THE FIRST PLAN WELL GOING AND WAS DECIDING WHETHER TO WEAR THE MAUVE CREPE DE CHINE OR THE WHITE CHIFFON WITH THE ROSEBUD EMBROIDERY AS A FIRST DOSE FOR MY FRIENDS
AUD0000000665_S0000584 MY HEART BEAT SO IT SHOOK THE LACE ON MY BREAST
AUD0000000665_S0000589 A CONFUSED RECOLLECTION OF HAVING HEARD THE WORDS AND TUNE SUNG BY MY MOTHER WHEN I WAS AT THE ROCKING AGE MYSELF BROUGHT THE TEARS TO MY EYES AS I FLEW TO THE WINDOW AND PARTED THE CURTAINS
AUD0000000665_S0000594 AND HE HELD A SLIMY FROG IN ONE HAND WHILE HE WIPED HIS OTHER GRIMY HAND DOWN THE FRONT OF HIS LINEN BLOUSE
AUD0000000665_S0000599 HE HELD UP ONE MUDDY HAND TO ME AND PROMPTLY I LIFTED HIM UP INTO MY ARMS
AUD0000000665_S0000605 HE BEGAN TO SQUIRM OUT OF MY ARMS TOWARD THE TABLE AND THE GLASS
AUD0000000665_S0000610 HE DON'T KNOW NO GOOD SONGS LIKE BLACK-EYED SUSAN OR LITTLE BOY BLUE I GO TO SLEEP QUICK CAUSE HE MAKES ME FEEL TIRED WITH HIS SLOW TUNE WHAT'S ONLY GOOD FOR FROGS AND THINGS
AUD0000000665_S0000617 IT WAS DELICIOUS AND I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I WOULD HAVE STAYED THERE JUST FEELING IT IF JANE HADN'T BROUGHT IN MY LETTER
AUD0000000665_S0000622 ESPECIALLY THE TURN OF HER HEAD LIKE A FLOWER ON ITS STEM
AUD0000000665_S0000629 OR MAYBE EARLIER
AUD0000000665_S0000636 I'M HONOURABLE AS ALL WOMEN ARE AT PECULIAR TIMES
AUD0000000665_S0000643 BUT IT TAKES MORE TIME TO CONCOCT ONE FOR A WIDOW ESPECIALLY IF IT IS FOR YOURSELF
AUD0000000665_S0000649 HE WAS ABOUT THE ONLY OASIS IN MY CHILDHOOD'S DAYS
AUD0000000665_S0000654 AND HE LET ME SEE THAT HE NOTICED IT OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYES AS WE WERE COMING OUT OF CHURCH UNDER AUNT ADELINE'S VERY ELBOW
AUD0000000665_S0000660 WITH A TIE THAT MELTED INTO IT IN TONE
AUD0000000665_S0000665 AND EVEN A FIRST COUSIN CAN BE AN EXASPERATION IN THAT CONDITION
AUD0000000665_S0000670 NOW MOLLY DON'T BE JEALOUS JUST BECAUSE OLD WADE HAS TAKEN HER OUT DRIVING BEHIND THE GREYS AFTER KISSING YOUR HAND UNDER THE LILACS YESTERDAY WHICH
AUD0000000665_S0000675 THE WAY THAT GIRL HAS MANAGED TO WAKE UP THIS LITTLE OLD TOWN IS A MARVEL HE CONTINUED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
AUD0000000665_S0000682 GOOD GRACIOUS MOLLY DON'T KNOCK THE TOWN DOWN LIKE THAT
AUD0000000665_S0000688 LET MY KINSHIP PROTECT ME
AUD0000000665_S0000695 SHALL IT BE SWITZERLAND OR JAPAN
AUD0000000665_S0000700 I WANTED HIM TO MEET IT ENTIRELY UNPREPARED
AUD0000000665_S0000705 AND I WAS AFRAID I SHOULD FIND AUNT ADELINE IN A FAINT WHEN I WENT INTO THE HOUSE
AUD0000000665_S0000711 I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE CONSIDERATE ABOUT DISCUSSING ALFRED'S TRIUMPH OVER THE ITALIAN MISSION
AUD0000000665_S0000716 THAT MRS JOHNSON JUST COULDN'T STAND AND SHE CAME ACROSS THE STREET IMMEDIATELY AND CALLED ME BACK TO THE GATE
AUD0000000665_S0000722 HE'S JUST A WEEK YOUNGER MRS JOHNSON AND I WOULDN'T TIE HIM FOR WORLDS
AUD0000000665_S0000727 AND A WEEK BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN IN THEIR CRADLES GETS TO BE FIFTEEN YEARS BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR GRAVES
AUD0000000665_S0000734 SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT AUNT ADELINE WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED IN IT UNTIL I HAD TIME TO TELL HER ALL ABOUT IT
AUD0000000665_S0000741 THAT'S WHAT MOST ENTERTAINING IN HILLSBORO IS LIKE
AUD0000000665_S0000746 AND SAW ALFRED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EVENING CLOTHES HIS FIRST
AUD0000000665_S0000751 AND WHY NOT
AUD0000000665_S0000757 I CUT OFF FOUR SLICES AND BUTTERED THEM TO AN EQUAL THICKNESS
AUD0000000665_S0000765 YOU ARE CRUEL CRUEL JOHN MOORE AND I HATE YOU WORSE THAN I EVER DID BEFORE IF THAT IS POSSIBLE
AUD0000000665_S0000776 HE ASKED AGAIN IN A STILL SOFTER VOICE
AUD0000000665_S0000782 AS HE DREW HIMSELF UP AND SAT IN THE WINDOW
AUD0000000665_S0000788 AS I HANDED HIM THE FIRST SLICE OF DRIPPY LUSCIOUSNESS
AUD0000000665_S0000797 AND I HAVE TO SIT AT THE ARK WINDOW FROM DAWN TO DUSK TO GET IN THE GALLON OF WATER I'M SUPPOSED TO CONSUME IN THAT TIME
AUD0000000665_S0000802 IT SEEMS TO ME YOU ARE ABOUT AS SLIM AS YOU WANT TO BE
AUD0000000665_S0000807 WONDER WHAT HE WOULD DO IF I GAVE IT TO HIM TO READ JUST AS IT IS
AUD0000000665_S0000812 THEN A CYCLONE HAPPENED TO ME
AUD0000000665_S0000818 NOW HOLD YOUR BREATH AS LONG AS YOU CAN HE COMMANDED
AUD0000000665_S0000823 MOONLIGHT NIGHTS AND LONESOMELY
AUD0000000665_S0000828 I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND YOU WERE JOKING HE SAID QUIETLY
AUD0000000665_S0000833 YOU THOUGHT I WENT TO TOWN TO BUY A MONUMENT AND I DIDN'T I BOUGHT ENOUGH CLOTHES FOR TWO BRIDES
AUD0000000665_S0000838 AUNT BETTIE POLLARD SAYS THAT IF I WANT TO GET MARRIED I OUGHT TO MARRY MR WILSON GRAVES BECAUSE OF HIS SEVEN CHILDREN
AUD0000000665_S0000844 I AM PERFECTLY MISERABLE AND I'M NOW THAT'LL DO MOLLY JUST HUSH FOR A HALF-MINUTE AND LET ME TALK TO YOU
AUD0000000665_S0000849 AND YOU ARE TO DO JUST AS I TELL YOU AND I SAY FORGET IT COME WITH ME WHILE I MAKE A CALL
AUD0000000665_S0000855 JUST TWO TINY ROOMS BUT THEY WERE CLEAN AND QUIET
AUD0000000665_S0000861 I DASN'T UNDRESS AND WASH THE YOUNGSTER MYSELF
AUD0000000665_S0000868 I FOUND THINGS BY JUST A GLANCE FROM HER
AUD0000000665_S0000873 SUDDENLY I TURNED MY FACE AGAINST HIS SLEEVE AND CRIED AS I NEVER HAD BEFORE
AUD0000000665_S0000878 WITHOUT LOOKING IN HIS DIRECTION AT ALL
AUD0000000665_S0000885 JANE TOLD ME WITH HER BROADEST GRIN THAT SHE HAD GONE DOWN TO HER SISTER-IN-LAW'S FOR SUPPER AND I SAT DOWN WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
AUD0000000665_S0000890 I LIKE HIM AND ALWAYS HAVE OF THAT I AM SURE
AUD0000000665_S0000895 RUTH CLINTON HAS MADE ME SEE THAT IF I WANT ALFRED IT WILL BE NOW OR NEVER AND QUICK
AUD0000000665_S0000902 IF NOT ALFRED WHAT THEN
AUD0000000665_S0000908 JUDGE WADE IS SO DELIGHTFUL THAT I FLUTTER AT THE THOUGHT
AUD0000000665_S0000913 THE GIRL HE WANTED TO MARRY DIED OF TURBERCULOSIS AND HE WEARS A LOCKET WITH HER IN IT YET
AUD0000000665_S0000920 I WISH HE WASN'T SO NEAR KIN TO ME
AUD0000000665_S0000925 BUT I KNOW BILLY WOULDN'T GET ON WITH THEM AT ALL
AUD0000000665_S0000930 MRS GRAVES LACKED THE KIND OF TEMPERAMENT POOR MR CARTER DID
AUD0000000665_S0000937 PROBABLY I SHALL HAVE THAT VERY THING TO DO
AUD0000000665_S0000943 MOLLY HE SAID IN THE MOST NONCHALANT MANNER IMAGINABLE
AUD0000000665_S0000949 YOU SAID YOU WOULD WAKE UP THIS TOWN AND NOW DO IT
AUD0000000665_S0000954 THAT SETTLED IT I COULDN'T LET A VISITING GIRL BE WORN OUT WITH ATTENTION OF COURSE
AUD0000000665_S0000959 IN THAT THAT TROUSSEAU MADAME RENE HAD MADE ME THERE WAS ONE
AUD0000000665_S0000966 I'M GLAD THAT POOR MR CARTER WAS SO STERN WITH ME ABOUT PADS IN MY HAIR
AUD0000000665_S0000971 I STOPPED ON NEXT TO THE BOTTOM STEP IN THE WIDE OLD HALL AND CALLED TOM TO TURN OUT THE LIGHT FOR ME AS JANE HAD GONE OUT
AUD0000000665_S0000977 MOLLY HE SAID
AUD0000000665_S0000983 TOM LAUGHED AND BEHAVED HIMSELF
AUD0000000665_S0000988 I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS WITH THEM FOR ALWAYS
AUD0000000665_S0000993 I WISH I COULD BE SURE OF HEARING MRS JOHNSON TELL AUNT ADELINE ALL ABOUT IT
AUD0000000665_S0000999 MISS CLINTON AND I EXCHANGED LITTLE LAUGHS AND SCRAPS OF CONVERSATION IN BETWEEN TIMES AND I FELL DEEPER AND DEEPER IN LOVE WITH HER
AUD0000000665_S0001006 HIS SLEEP-PLACE ON MY BREAST ACHES
AUD0000000665_S0001017 A LITTLE LATER JANE WAS EXCLAIMING OVER A TWO-YEAR-OLD HAM THAT HAD BEEN SIMMERED IN SOME WONDERFUL LIQUOR AND LARDED WITH EGG DRESSING
AUD0000000665_S0001022 AND ROAST FOWL SEEMED FOOLISH EATING BESIDE THEM
AUD0000000665_S0001028 I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING TO SET OFF HER BLUE EYES AND FAIR HAIR SHE WAS SAYING AS SHE CUT ORANGE PEEL INTO STRIPS
AUD0000000665_S0001033 AND I HAVE HOPES I NEVER HAD BEFORE
AUD0000000665_S0001039 I'D PUT JOHN MOORE AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE IF I WERE YOU MOLLY CARTER BECAUSE HE'S ABOUT THE ONLY MAN YOU'VE INVITED THAT HAS GOT ANY SENSE LEFT SINCE YOU AND THAT CLINTON GIRL TOOK TO GOING ABOUT HILLSBORO
AUD0000000665_S0001044 I HAVE ABOUT DECIDED ON HIM FOR RUTH SINCE THE JUDGE HAS TAKEN TO FOLLOWING MOLLY ABOUT AS BAD AS BILLY MOORE DOES
AUD0000000665_S0001049 JUST THE OTHER DAY DEARIE ME JANE WHAT HAS BOILED OVER NOW
AUD0000000665_S0001054 STILL I DON'T SEE WHY RUTH CLINTON SHOULD HAVE HER HEAD LITERALLY THROWN AGAINST THAT STONE WALL
AUD0000000665_S0001061 IT HAD A SURPRISE IN IT AND I SAT BACK ON THE GRASS AND READ IT WITH MY HEART BEATING LIKE A HAMMER
AUD0000000665_S0001066 SURELY NO WOMAN EVER IN ALL THE WORLD READ SUCH A LETTER AS THAT AND NO WONDER MY BREATH ALMOST FAILED ME
AUD0000000665_S0001072 OR TAKEN WITH MY BEAUTY AND WHO WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN SUCH LOVE IF IT WERE SHOWN TO THEM THROUGH A TELESCOPE
AUD0000000665_S0001078 I AM SO ILL I'M GOING TO DIE HERE ON THE FLOOR AND HE SANK INTO MY ARMS
AUD0000000665_S0001084 WHERE'S MAMIE I THOUGHT TO ASK WITH THE GREATEST APPREHENSION
AUD0000000665_S0001089 FATHER ISN'T NO GOOD AND I DON'T CARE WHAT HE SAYS ANSWERED BILLY WITH SPIRIT
AUD0000000665_S0001094 YOUR FATHER IS THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD AND YOU MUST NEVER NEVER LEAVE HIM
AUD0000000665_S0001100 AND TEARS FROM ANOTHER CORNER OF MY HEART ENTIRELY ROSE TO MY EYES AT THE THOUGHT
AUD0000000665_S0001105 BUT I LOOKED TO MYSELF ABOUT THE EYES AS I HAD BEEN DOING FOR YEARS
AUD0000000665_S0001110 THE TALL WHITE LILIES LAID THEIR HEADS OVER ON MY BREAST AND WENT TO SLEEP BEFORE I HAD SAID A WORD TO THEM
AUD0000000665_S0001115 DON'T GATHER THEM ALL TO-NIGHT MRS MOLLY SAID DR JOHN TEASINGLY AS HE STOOPED BESIDE ME
AUD0000000665_S0001122 I NEVER POSSIBLY KNOW HOW TO ANSWER ANY REMARK THAT HE MAY HAPPEN TO MAKE
AUD0000000665_S0001127 I WISH MRS JOHNSON COULD HAVE HEARD HOW SOFT HIS VOICE LINGERED OVER THAT LITTLE HALF-SENTENCE
AUD0000000665_S0001132 I WONDERED WHY I WAS HAVING A PARTY IN MY HOUSE WHEN BEING ALONE IN MY GARDEN WITH JUST A NEIGHBOUR WAS SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING
AUD0000000665_S0001137 THERE IS NO GLIMMER IN THE WORLD LIKE THAT WHICH COMES FROM REALLY OLD POLISHED SILVER AND ROSEWOOD AND MAHOGANY
AUD0000000665_S0001142 WOULD I SIT AT TABLE WITH PEOPLE WHO LOVED ME LIKE THIS
AUD0000000665_S0001147 HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE MATTER REALLY WAS BUT HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT I NEEDED HE ALWAYS DOES
AUD0000000665_S0001152 IT WAS A SIMPLE LITTLE TELEGRAM BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NITRO-GLYCERINE ON A TEAR FOR THE WAY IT ACTED
AUD0000000665_S0001157 HE WAS SO WHITE AND SHAKY THAT PET LOOKED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT
AUD0000000665_S0001163 HIS APPETITE IS AS STRONG AS HIS NERVES
AUD0000000665_S0001169 WE ALL HELD OUR BREATHS AND WAITED FOR HIM TO SPEAK
AUD0000000665_S0001175 TOM TOOK PET HOME EARLY AND I HOPE THEY WALKED IN THE MOONLIGHT FOR HOURS
AUD0000000665_S0001181 AND THE OTHERS HAD AT LAST LEFT THE JUDGE AND ME ALONE ALSO IN THE MOONLIGHT WHICH I WISHED IN MY HEART SOMEBODY WOULD PUT OUT
AUD0000000665_S0001186 DON'T ARGUE BUT PUT ON YOUR BONNET AND COME WITH ME
AUD0000000665_S0001191 STILL WE HAVE BEEN SO CLOSE TOGETHER OVER HIS BABY AND I HAVE GROWN SO DEPENDENT ON HIM FOR SO MANY THINGS
AUD0000000665_S0001201 BUT HE WILL
AUD0000000665_S0001206 INCIDENTAL TO MY BATH AND DRESSING I WEIGHED AND FOUND THAT I HAD LOST ALL FOUR OF THOSE LAST SURPLUS POUNDS AND TWO MORE IN THREE DAYS
AUD0000000665_S0001211 IT WAS WORK AND THEN I TOOK UP THE JUDGE'S LETTER
AUD0000000665_S0001216 AT THE TENTH PAGE WE BURIED HER AND TOOK UP ALFRED AND I MUST SAY I SAW A NEW ALFRED IN THE JUDGE'S BOUQUET-STREWN APPRECIATION OF HIM
AUD0000000665_S0001221 AND SHE WOULDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT IT UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE TO BE ANYTHING BUT MAD
AUD0000000665_S0001227 AND I DON'T WANT TO INSPIRE ANYBODY IT'S TOO HEAVY AN UNDERTAKING
AUD0000000665_S0001233 AND I'M ALWAYS IN DANGER FROM HOT CAKES AND CHICKEN GRAVY
AUD0000000665_S0001238 HE DOES LIVE IN HILLSBORO
AUD0000000665_S0001243 AND IT ALWAYS UPSETS MY NERVES
AUD0000000665_S0001248 SHE SAID WITH HER WORDS LITERALLY FALLING OVER THEMSELVES
AUD0000000665_S0001253 WILL BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT US
AUD0000000665_S0001258 AND KISSED AND LAUGHED AGAIN FOR GOOD-BYE
AUD0000000665_S0001265 WELL FROM ALL MY LONG EXPERIENCE MOLLY
AUD0000000665_S0001271 AND YOU'LL HAVE TO GO ON LIVING WITH HIM MAYBE FIFTY YEARS
AUD0000000665_S0001276 AND ALTOGETHER GAVE HIS FAMILY A BAD TIME OF IT
AUD0000000665_S0001281 BUT I DECIDED TO TRY MRS JOHNSON
AUD0000000665_S0001289 HIS MARRYING ONCE WAS JUST ACCIDENTAL AND MUST BE FORGIVEN HIM
AUD0000000665_S0001294 THANK GOODNESS THAT HAT WILL NEVER DROP
AUD0000000665_S0001300 IT'S FUNNY HOW MRS JOHNSON ALWAYS KNOWS WHAT MR JOHNSON WANTS BEFORE HE KNOWS HIMSELF AND GETS IT BEFORE HE ASKS FOR IT
AUD0000000665_S0001305 THEY JUST IRRITATE THE TOP SOIL
AUD0000000665_S0001310 I TRIED MY BEST
AUD0000000665_S0001316 AS IT HAS A HABIT OF DOING WHEN HE IS MOST EXCITED
AUD0000000665_S0001322 I ASKED DROPPING INTO THE GAME AS I HAVE ALWAYS DONE WITH HIM
AUD0000000665_S0001329 MY MIND QUICKLY REVERTED TO THOSE TWO PONDEROUS AND INTENSE EPISTLES I HAD GOT WITHIN THE HOUR
AUD0000000665_S0001334 WHICH WORD MEANS INTENSE
AUD0000000665_S0001340 HIS IS A HEAP THE BIGGEST ANYWAY
AUD0000000665_S0001346 YOU'RE JUST PLAYING GO-AWAY AREN'T YOU
AUD0000000665_S0001351 AND YOU COULD COME WITH US IF YOU WAS GOOD
AUD0000000665_S0001356 AND YOU'D CRY ALL BY YOURSELF WITH ME GONE
AUD0000000665_S0001361 I HURRIED ACROSS THE GARDEN AND INTO DR MOORE'S SURGERY
AUD0000000665_S0001367 I DIDN'T KNOW BILL WOULD TELL YOU SO SOON MRS MOLLY
AUD0000000665_S0001372 BUT BILL YOU SEE IS NO RESPECTER OF OF OTHER PEOPLE'S HAPPY DAYS IF HE WANTS THEM IN HIS
AUD0000000665_S0001377 BILL IS TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND WHEN HE IS IS BEING BEREAVED MOLLY
AUD0000000665_S0001382 AND I COULDN'T GO WITHOUT HIM COULD I
AUD0000000665_S0001387 HOW DARE YOU SAY SUCH A THING TO ME
AUD0000000665_S0001392 EVEN THE LAW DOESN'T HELP US POOR HELPLESS CREATURES
AUD0000000665_S0001397 WHEN THAT AWFUL WORD
AUD0000000665_S0001402 WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS
AUD0000000665_S0001408 AND YOU CAN WHISTLE BILL FROM ME ANY DAY
AUD0000000665_S0001413 I ANSWERED HAUGHTILY
AUD0000000665_S0001418 FROM NOW ON
AUD0000000665_S0001425 AND HOW I HAD SAID IT
AUD0000000665_S0001430 AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TURN ON MY HEELS AND LEAVE HIM
AUD0000000665_S0001436 AND FOR LIFE I AM YOURS AT COMMAND AS HE IS
AUD0000000665_S0001441 SOMETHING IN ME DIED FOR EVER I THINK WHEN HE SPOKE TO ME LIKE THAT
AUD0000000665_S0001446 THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR MY LIVING
AUD0000000665_S0001451 BILLY ASKED ME TO GO WITH HIM ON THIS AWFUL WHALE-HUNT I SOBBED OUT TO COMFORT MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY DID CARE FOR ME
AUD0000000665_S0001458 IF THAT IS WHAT SUITS BILL THE BOSS
AUD0000000665_S0001463 IT WAS A HORRIBLE CRUEL THING FOR HIM TO SAY TO ME
AUD0000000665_S0001469 MY HUMILIATION IS COMPLETE
AUD0000000665_S0001474 BUT HE MUST NEVER
AUD0000000665_S0001482 THAT IS ALL
AUD0000000665_S0001487 TWICE TO GIVE YOURSELF WITHOUT LOVE
AUD0000000665_S0001501 MELTED
AUD0000000665_S0001507 BUT IT IS ALL OVER AT LAST AND
AUD0000000665_S0001512 AND THE TENDERNESS OF HER ARMS WAS A SACRAMENT
AUD0000000665_S0001517 WE STOPPED THERE WHILE I GAVE HER THE DOCUMENT TO READ
AUD0000000665_S0001522 AND EVEN NOW I FEEL THAT ONLY MY MARRIAGE VOWS WILL CLOSE UP THE CASE FOR THE JUDGE EVEN YET HE MAY
AUD0000000665_S0001534 AND BEFORE I KNEW IT I HAD POURED OUT THE WHOLE TRUTH TO HER IN A PERFECT CATARACT OF WORDS
AUD0000000665_S0001539 SHE EXCLAIMED AS SHE REACHED OUT AND DREW ME INTO HER LOVELY GRACIOUS ARMS
AUD0000000665_S0001544 I ACCEPT MY OWN SORROW AT HIS HANDS WILLINGLY
AUD0000000665_S0001551 FEELING LESS THAN A WORM
AUD0000000665_S0001558 MOLLY
AUD0000000665_S0001566 YOU OUGHT AT LEAST TO PAY THE PIPER
AUD0000000665_S0001571 I HAD THE SPIRIT TO SAY AS I WENT OVER TO THE DESK FOR MY PURSE
AUD0000000665_S0001578 IT IS TRUE THAT A BROADER SYMPATHY IS ONE OF THE BY-PRODUCTS OF SORROW
AUD0000000665_S0001584 WHICH TOOK OFF AN INCH OF PAINT AS IT BUMPED AGAINST THE DOORWAY
AUD0000000665_S0001590 HE WAS HOT
AUD0000000665_S0001599 LOVER
AUD0000000665_S0001606 HE SAID FLARING HIS ASTONISHED BLUE EYES AT ME
AUD0000000665_S0001613 I COULDN'T HELP THE TEARS THAT CAME TO STOP MY WORDS
AUD0000000665_S0001621 HE COAXED AGAINST MY CHEEK
AUD0000000665_S0001626 YOU ARE
AUD0000000665_S0001635 AND OF COURSE HE IS TO BE THEIR GUEST WHILE HE IS IN TOWN
AUD0000000665_S0001641 I SAW MR GRAVES TALKING TO DELIA HAWES IN FRONT OF THE DRAPER'S AN HOUR AGO
AUD0000000665_S0001647 MAYBE IT DID BUT IS JUST TAKING FIRE SLOWLY
AUD0000000665_S0001656 BUT COME ON IN BOTH OF YOU
AUD0000000665_S0001663 AND IF ALFRED'S PUDDING TASTED OF THE SALT OF DEAD SEA FRUIT THIS EVENING
AUD0000000665_S0001668 BUT FOR LONG MINUTES I STOOD IN FRONT OF MY MIRROR AND QUESTIONED MYSELF
AUD0000000665_S0001676 TWENTY-THREE-INCH WAIST SHROUD AND LET IT SLIP OVER MY HEAD AND FALL SLIMLY AROUND ME
AUD0000000665_S0001682 AND RUTH CLINTON WAS LOOKING UP INTO HIS FACE WITH AN EXPRESSION I AM GLAD I CAN NEVER FORGET
AUD0000000665_S0001688 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY POUNDS HE WEIGHS AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY EVER TO TELL ME
AUD0000000665_S0001694 SLAMMED THE DOOR AND BACKED UP AGAINST IT
AUD0000000665_S0001699 HIDE ME QUICK
AUD0000000665_S0001704 I PANTED
AUD0000000665_S0001709 I WENT
AUD0000000665_S0001717 MOLLY
AUD0000000665_S0001722 I EXCLAIMED CROWDING STILL CLOSER
AUD0000000665_S0001727 BUT I CAN'T HELP THAT I'D RATHER YOU DO THE SUFFERING WITH ME THAN TO DO IT MYSELF AWAY FROM YOU
AUD0000000665_S0001733 YES
AUD0000000665_S0001743 BUT YOU ARE TO BLAME FOR LETTING ME DO IT
AUD0000000665_S0001750 BUT THAT DAY YOU CAME TO ME ALL IN A FLUTTER WITH BENNETT'S LETTER IN YOUR HAND IT IS GOING TO TAKE YOU A LIFETIME TO SETTLE FOR
AUD0000000665_S0001756 WHAT BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS WAS HIS FUMBLING WITH THE LACE ON THAT BLUE MUSLIN RELICT OF A SENTIMENT
AUD0000000665_S0001763 HE ASKED
AUD0000000665_S0001769 THAT I HAD HELPED PREPARE AT THE JOHNSONS'
AUD0000000665_S0001774 A MAN THAT CAN'T BE HAPPY WITH A WOMAN WHO IS WILLING TO FULFIL HIS DESTINY DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE

AUD0000000694_S0001996 THE WELL-REMEMBERED VOICE LEAVES A MESSAGE BEHIND IT
AUD0000000708_S0000010 NOW WAIST-DEEP IN LUSH JUNGLE GRASSES STARRED WITH MYRIAD GORGEOUS BLOOMS
AUD0000000708_S0000016 THIS REMINDS ME OF SOUTH CLARK STREET REMARKED BRADY WHO HAD ONCE SERVED ON THE TRAFFIC SQUAD IN CHICAGO AND AS NO ONE ASKED HIM WHY HE VOLUNTEERED THAT IT WAS BECAUSE IT'S NO PLACE FOR AN IRISHMAN
AUD0000000708_S0000023 WE'LL TRY TO GO AROUND HIM
AUD0000000708_S0000028 THE LEAFY BRANCHES PARTED
AUD0000000708_S0000033 HE WAS EXPOSED TO THE SHOULDERS NOW
AUD0000000708_S0000038 THE MAN HAD A GOOD START AND THE TREE WAS NOT FAR AWAY BUT THE SPEED OF THE ENORMOUS CREATURE BEHIND HIM WAS SOMETHING TO MARVEL AT
AUD0000000708_S0000044 THE BEAR HALTED IN ITS TRACKS WHEELED TOWARD BRADLEY AND THEN BACK AGAIN TOWARD TIPPET
AUD0000000708_S0000049 AND AS HE SAW THE BEAR APPARENTLY UPON THE VERGE OF DECIDING TO CHARGE HIM
AUD0000000708_S0000054 THE OTHER MEN NOW SAFELY ENSCONCED UPON VARIOUS BRANCHES WATCHED THE RACE WITH BREATHLESS INTEREST
AUD0000000708_S0000059 IT ALL HAPPENED IN A FEW SECONDS BUT THEY WERE SECONDS THAT SEEMED LIKE HOURS TO THE MEN WHO WATCHED
AUD0000000708_S0000064 FIRING AS HE RAN TIPPET RACED AFTER THE GREAT CAVE BEAR THE MONSTROUS THING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXTINCT AGES BEFORE RAN FOR IT AND FIRED EVEN AS THE BEAST WAS ALMOST UPON BRADLEY
AUD0000000708_S0000069 OVERCAUTIOUS SOME THOUGHT HIM
AUD0000000708_S0000074 JUST THEN IT OCCURRED TO BRADY TO FIRE AND HE TOO OPENED UPON THE BEAR
AUD0000000708_S0000080 THE CREATURE SANK LIMPLY TO THE GROUND AND BRADLEY SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET
AUD0000000708_S0000085 LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THE PARTY CROSSED A SMALL STREAM OF WARM WATER UPON THE SLUGGISHLY MOVING SURFACE OF WHICH FLOATED COUNTLESS MILLIONS OF TINY GREEN EGGS SURROUNDED BY A LIGHT SCUM OF THE SAME COLOR
AUD0000000708_S0000090 THERE HAD BEEN THE PURE APES HUGE GORILLALIKE BEASTS AND THOSE WHO WALKED A TRIFLE MORE ERECT AND HAD FEATURES WITH JUST A SHADE MORE OF THE HUMAN CAST ABOUT THEM
AUD0000000708_S0000097 AND SO IT WAS THAT BRADLEY HAD NO DESIRE TO FOLLOW UP THE LITTLE STREAM TOWARD THE POOL NEAR WHICH WERE SURE TO BE THE CAVES OF SOME SAVAGE TRIBE
AUD0000000708_S0000102 ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY THERE APPEARED SOUTH OF THEM A PARTY OF NAKED MEN ARMED WITH CLUBS AND HATCHETS
AUD0000000708_S0000107 WHICH STILL RETAINED A CONSIDERABLE TRACE OF APISH PROGENITORS
AUD0000000708_S0000113 BRADLEY STEPPED FORWARD WITH UPRAISED HAND
AUD0000000708_S0000119 COME
AUD0000000708_S0000124 CAN'T WASTE AMMUNITION
AUD0000000708_S0000131 AND AS THE EUROPEANS GATHERED AROUND
AUD0000000708_S0000136 AT BRADLEY'S COMMAND
AUD0000000708_S0000141 BRADY WAS A BRAVE MAN
AUD0000000708_S0000148 THEN BRADY SPOKE AGAIN IN AN ALMOST INAUDIBLE VOICE
AUD0000000708_S0000153 ITS HUGE ROUND EYES GLARING DOWN UPON THEM
AUD0000000708_S0000160 YES SAID SINCLAIR WITH FINE SARCASM
AUD0000000708_S0000167 ITS FACE WAS MORE HUMAN THAN OTHERWISE
AUD0000000708_S0000176 OH GORD
AUD0000000708_S0000182 AND I COULD SEE ITS YELLOW TEETH BEHIND THIN TIGHT-DRAWN LIPS LIKE A MAN WHO HAD BEEN DEAD A LONG WHILE SIR HE ADDED TURNING TOWARD BRADLEY
AUD0000000708_S0000188 ONE OF US IS GOIN' TO DIE
AUD0000000708_S0000193 WASTE OF TIME CAN'T WASTE TIME
AUD0000000708_S0000198 HE COMMENCED HUMMING IT'S A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY AND PRESENTLY TO VOICE THE WORDS
AUD0000000708_S0000204 MOVED RESTLESSLY ABOUT
AUD0000000708_S0000209 SINCLAIR WAS STANDING GUARD
AUD0000000708_S0000214 AND THEN AS THOUGH THE HAND OF DEATH HAD REACHED OUT AND TOUCHED THEM ALL
AUD0000000708_S0000219 BRADLEY WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
AUD0000000708_S0000225 DO YOU BELIEVE IN GHOSTS SIR
AUD0000000708_S0000232 NOW GO TO SLEEP
AUD0000000708_S0000238 AS HE ALREADY HAD EXCEEDED THE TIME DECIDED UPON BY BOWEN TYLER AND HIMSELF FOR THE EXPEDITION
AUD0000000708_S0000300 AND POSSIBLY IF YOU ARE
AUD0000000708_S0000306 BUT THEY RAN IN BAFFLING TURNS AND TWISTS NOR EVER REACHED A DESTINATION
AUD0000000708_S0000312 AND THE COLUMNS WERE OF VARYING HEIGHTS
AUD0000000708_S0000317 THEY RIMMED THE EAVES OF EVERY HOUSE
AUD0000000708_S0000322 MOST OF THEM WERE APPARELED ALL IN WHITE LIKE HIS CAPTORS BUT OTHERS HAD MARKINGS OF RED OR BLUE OR YELLOW SLASHED ACROSS THE FRONT OF THEIR ROBES
AUD0000000708_S0000327 IF ANY QUESTION YOU SAY THAT YOU BELONG TO FOSH-BAL-SOJ
AUD0000000708_S0000332 THE CITY APPEARED INTERMINABLE
AUD0000000708_S0000337 HE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE SMOOTH WORN PAVEMENT
AUD0000000708_S0000343 A SEAT PROTRUDED FROM EACH OF THE FOUR SIDES OF THE PEDESTALS JUST A FLAT BOARD WITH A SUPPORT RUNNING FROM ITS OUTER END DIAGONALLY TO THE BASE OF THE PEDESTAL
AUD0000000708_S0000348 WHO ARE YOU HE CRIED WHAT DO YOU WANT
AUD0000000708_S0000354 THE WIEROO LOOKED PUZZLED SIT HERE JAAL-LU HE SNAPPED
AUD0000000708_S0000359 HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AT THE WIEROO IN HIS IMMEDIATE VICINITY
AUD0000000708_S0000366 BRADLEY WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD A PEDESTAL ALL TO HIMSELF
AUD0000000708_S0000371 AFTER THE FIRST MOUTHFUL HE CARED EVEN LESS TO INVESTIGATE THE ANTECEDENTS OF THE DISH FOR HE FOUND IT PECULIARLY PALATABLE
AUD0000000708_S0000376 HE FELL TO EXAMINING THE DISH FROM WHICH HE HAD EATEN AND THE PEDESTAL UPON WHICH IT RESTED
AUD0000000708_S0000382 THE FLOOR OF STONE SLABS WAS POLISHED BY THE CONTACT OF POSSIBLY MILLIONS OF NAKED FEET AND WORN AWAY IN THE AISLES BETWEEN THE PEDESTALS SO THAT THE LATTER RESTED UPON LITTLE MOUNDS OF STONE SEVERAL INCHES ABOVE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF THE FLOOR
AUD0000000708_S0000388 OR WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BUT CASPAK A SQUARE BIT OF PAPER
AUD0000000708_S0000395 AS THESE THOUGHTS FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND THE WIEROO HELD OUT A PEN OF BONE FIXED TO A WOODEN HOLDER AT THE SAME TIME MADE A SIGN THAT BRADLEY WAS TO WRITE UPON THE PAPER
AUD0000000708_S0000401 OF COURSE IT COULD MAKE NOTHING OF THE STRANGE CHARACTERS BUT IT EVIDENTLY ACCEPTED THEM AS PROOF THAT BRADLEY POSSESSED KNOWLEDGE OF A WRITTEN LANGUAGE OF HIS OWN
AUD0000000708_S0000407 OUTSIDE WERE SEVERAL WIEROOS THAT HAD BEEN EATING AT THE PEDESTALS WITHIN
AUD0000000708_S0000412 SINCE THE STERN LAWS OF THE WIEROOS FORBADE ALTERCATIONS WITHIN SUCH WALLS
AUD0000000708_S0000418 BRADLEY SWUNG UPON THE CREATURE AND WITH A HEAVY BLOW TO THE JAW FELLED IT
AUD0000000708_S0000423 HE DARED NOT USE HIS PISTOL FOR FEAR THAT ONCE THEY DISCOVERED ITS POWER HE WOULD BE OVERCOME BY WEIGHT OF NUMBERS AND RELIEVED OF POSSESSION OF WHAT HE CONSIDERED HIS TRUMP CARD TO BE RESERVED UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT THAT IT MIGHT BE USED TO AID IN HIS ESCAPE
AUD0000000708_S0000428 THE WHILE THEY MOANED AND WAILED IN LUGUBRIOUS CHORUS
AUD0000000708_S0000434 THOUGH NO SOONER DID HE REACH THE TOP OF THE LADDER THAN A GREAT FLAPPING OF WINGS BENEATH HIM WARNED HIM THAT THE WIEROOS WERE RISING AFTER HIM
AUD0000000708_S0000439 FOSH-BAL-SOJ LISTENED TO THEIR COMPLAINTS AND THEN WITH A SUDDEN SWEEP OF HIS RIGHT HAND SEIZED BRADLEY BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK AND HURLED HIM SPRAWLING THROUGH THE DOORWAY UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
AUD0000000708_S0000445 I AM GOING TO KILL YOU FOR THAT
AUD0000000708_S0000451 FOR BRADLEY HAD HIM BY THE THROAT BEFORE HE COULD UTTER A CRY AND WITH HIS RIGHT HAND STRUCK HIM HEAVILY AND REPEATEDLY UPON HIS FACE AND OVER HIS HEART UGLY SMASHING SHORT-ARM JABS OF THE SORT THAT TAKE THE FIGHT OUT OF A MAN IN QUICK TIME
AUD0000000708_S0000456 AND TOGETHER THE TWO FELL HEAVILY TO THE FLOOR
AUD0000000708_S0000461 AND EVEN THEN WITH DEATH STARING HIM IN THE FACE
AUD0000000708_S0000466 WHO LAY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES GASPING PAINFULLY IN AN EFFORT TO REGAIN HIS BREATH
AUD0000000708_S0000471 HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO FIND SOME MEANS FOR CONCEALING THE EVIDENCE OF HIS DEED AND THEN TO MAKE A BOLD EFFORT TO ESCAPE
AUD0000000708_S0000478 BUT WAS WITHOUT THE EXIT THROUGH THE ROOF AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL
AUD0000000708_S0000483 THE LID WAS MADE IN TWO PIECES EACH BEING HINGED AT AN OPPOSITE END OF THE CHEST AND JOINING NICELY WHERE THEY MET IN THE CENTER OF THE CHEST
AUD0000000708_S0000488 HE BENT CLOSER TO EXAMINE THE CONTENTS THE CHEST WAS ABOUT HALF FILLED WITH AN ASSORTMENT OF GOLDEN TRINKETS
AUD0000000708_S0000493 AND INTO THIS HE FORCED THE CORPSE
AUD0000000708_S0000499 AND TO THE RIGHT ANOTHER BUILDING SHUT OFF HIS LINE OF VISION AT ABOUT TWENTY FEET
AUD0000000708_S0000505 THUS CONCEALING HIMSELF FROM THE SIGHT OF THE WIEROO
AUD0000000708_S0000510 WHICH WAS HEIGHTENED WHEN AS IN ONE OF THE DOORS HE HAD SEEN
AUD0000000708_S0000515 AN ECCENTRIC DISK UPON THE INSIDE FACE OF THE DOOR ENGAGED A SLOT IN THE FRAME WHEN IT WAS DESIRED TO SECURE THE DOOR AGAINST INTRUDERS
AUD0000000708_S0000520 AND SO BOLDLY PUSHING IT IN HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD AND ENTERED A SMALL APARTMENT
AUD0000000708_S0000525 NOR WAS SHE APPARELED AS THEY OR RATHER SHE DID NOT ENTIRELY LACK APPAREL AS DID MOST OF THEM
AUD0000000708_S0000530 HER SKIN WAS WHITE AS FROM LONG CONFINEMENT WITHIN DOORS BUT IT WAS CLEAR AND FINE
AUD0000000708_S0000537 AND THEN BRADLEY SPOKE USING TO THE BEST OF HIS POOR ABILITY
AUD0000000708_S0000542 I AM NO WIEROO
AUD0000000708_S0000548 AND NEVER HAVE I SEEN A MALE GALU BROUGHT HITHER BEFORE
AUD0000000708_S0000553 HE TOLD HER BRIEFLY WHO AND WHAT HE WAS
AUD0000000708_S0000559 IT CAME THROUGH THE DOORWAY JUST AHEAD OF YOU
AUD0000000708_S0000564 AND STEPPING TO THE DOOR THE CREATURE RAISED ITS VOICE IN ONE OF THOSE UNCANNY DEPRESSING WAILS
AUD0000000708_S0000569 DEFILER IT SCREAMED YOU DARE TO THREATEN ONE OF THE SACRED CHOSEN OF LUATA
AUD0000000708_S0000574 AND WHAT OF YOU ASKED BRADLEY
AUD0000000708_S0000580 EGGS YOUNG
AUD0000000708_S0000587 HE WHO SPEAKS FOR LUATA HAS CHOSEN YOU FOR HIMSELF
AUD0000000708_S0000593 SHE SHOOK HER HEAD SORROWFULLY
AUD0000000708_S0000598 FOR ONLY THE WIEROOS LIVE UPON THIS ISLAND AND THEY DWELL ALWAYS IN CITIES OF WHICH THERE ARE THREE THIS BEING THE LARGEST
AUD0000000708_S0000603 THE TWO HAD SPOKEN RAPIDLY BUT WERE NOW INTERRUPTED BY THE ADVENT THROUGH THE OPENING IN THE ROOF OF SEVERAL WIEROOS WHO HAD COME IN ANSWER TO THE ALARM IT OF THE YELLOW SLASHING HAD UTTERED
AUD0000000708_S0000611 BUT THE FIRST ONE WENT REELING BACKWARD AGAINST HIS FELLOWS FROM THE BLOW TO THE CHIN WHICH BRADLEY FOLLOWED UP WITH A RUSH AND THE INTENTION TO CLEAN UP THE ROOM IN RECORD TIME BUT HE HAD RECKONED WITHOUT THE OPENING IN THE ROOF
AUD0000000708_S0000617 AT A WORD FROM THE WIEROO OF THE YELLOW SLASHING WHO EVIDENTLY WAS A PERSON OF AUTHORITY ONE LEFT AND PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH FIBER ROPES WITH WHICH BRADLEY WAS TIGHTLY BOUND
AUD0000000708_S0000623 IT WAS NOT AS LARGE AS HE HAD IMAGINED
AUD0000000708_S0000628 THE COLORS WERE VARIED AND STARTLING THE ARCHITECTURE AMAZING
AUD0000000708_S0000634 HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF A COLOSSAL CHINESE COOLIE HAT INVERTED
AUD0000000708_S0000639 OVER THE OPENING IN THE ROOF WAS A GRATED COVERING
AUD0000000708_S0000644 THEN THE CREATURE LOWERED AWAY UNTIL BRADLEY'S HEAD CAME IN SUDDEN AND PAINFUL CONTACT WITH THE FLOOR BELOW
AUD0000000708_S0000651 HE COULD SEE NOTHING OF HIS SURROUNDINGS IN THE GLOOM ABOUT HIM UNTIL AFTER A FEW MINUTES HIS EYES BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE DARK INTERIOR WHEN HE ROLLED THEM FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN SURVEY OF HIS PRISON
AUD0000000708_S0000656 HE WAS A MAN OF POWERFUL PHYSIQUE
AUD0000000708_S0000662 WITH EYES STRAINING THROUGH THE GLOOM THE MAN LAY WATCHING THE GRIM AND SINISTER THING IN THE CORNER
AUD0000000708_S0000667 WITH RENEWED STRENGTH BRADLEY STRAINED AT HIS BONDS
AUD0000000708_S0000672 BRADLEY WAS A BRAVE MAN ORDINARILY HIS NERVES WERE OF STEEL BUT TO BE AT THE MERCY OF SOME UNKNOWN AND NAMELESS HORROR
AUD0000000708_S0000677 IT WAS NOT DEATH THAT HE FEARED NOW IT WAS THAT HORROR OF THE UNKNOWN THAT IS PART THE FIBER OF EVERY SON OF WOMAN
AUD0000000708_S0000682 HE COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AND THEN FROM OUT OF THE BUNDLE OF RAGS ISSUED A HOLLOW GROAN
AUD0000000708_S0000687 THEN THERE BROKE FROM IT A MANIACAL LAUGH
AUD0000000708_S0000693 FOOD FOOD
AUD0000000708_S0000698 FOOD
AUD0000000708_S0000703 LIKE A MONSTROUS RAT SEEKING HIS LIFE'S BLOOD
AUD0000000708_S0000708 UNTIL BRADLEY THOUGHT THOSE TWO EXPRESSIONS ALONE WOULD DRIVE HIM MAD
AUD0000000708_S0000713 WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL FOR SUPPORT
AUD0000000708_S0000718 THERE BROKE FROM THE DRAWN LIPS THE MUMBLED WORDS FOOD FOOD
AUD0000000708_S0000723 AND THEN TOO THERE WAS THE SUGGESTION OF HOPE HELD OUT BY THE CONSTANT REITERATION OF THE PHRASE
AUD0000000708_S0000730 IT BROUGHT THE MAN TO A SITTING POSTURE HIS HANDS OFF THE GROUND
AUD0000000708_S0000736 I WAS YOUNG AND STRONG WHEN THEY BROUGHT ME HERE
AUD0000000708_S0000741 FOOD
AUD0000000708_S0000746 FOOD WHIMPERED AN-TAK
AUD0000000708_S0000751 AN-TAK SEIZED UPON IT AND DEVOURED IT RAVENOUSLY
AUD0000000708_S0000758 AND WHY THE WOMEN OF EACH TRIBE IMMERSED THEMSELVES EACH MORNING FOR AN HOUR OR MORE IN THE WARM POOLS NEAR WHICH THE HABITATIONS OF THEIR PEOPLE ALWAYS WERE LOCATED AND TOO HE DISCOVERED WHY THOSE POOLS WERE ALMOST IMMUNE FROM THE ATTACKS OF CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS AND REPTILES
AUD0000000708_S0000763 DEVELOPING AS THEY DRIFTED SLOWLY TOWARD THE SEA
AUD0000000708_S0000768 AND IN THIS FORM ALWAYS DEVELOPING
AUD0000000708_S0000774 WHILE BY FAR THE GREATER PROPORTION FORMED THE FOOD SUPPLY OF THE RAVENOUS CREATURES OF THE DEEP
AUD0000000708_S0000779 FROM THE APE THE INDIVIDUAL IF IT SURVIVED SLOWLY DEVELOPED INTO THE LOWEST ORDER OF MAN THE ALU AND THEN BY DEGREES TO BO-LU STO-LU BAND-LU KRO-LU AND FINALLY GALU
AUD0000000708_S0000788 IT IS PLAINLY A WONDER THAT EVEN A SINGLE BABE HAS EVER BEEN BORN TO A GALU WOMAN
AUD0000000708_S0000793 IT APPEARED SIMPLER
AUD0000000708_S0000798 THEN THE GALU RECOMMENCED HIS FOOD FOOD
AUD0000000708_S0000803 HE WHO DIED HERE JUST AFTER I CAME
AUD0000000708_S0000808 HE WAS TRYING TO TELL ME HOW TO FIND IT WHEN HE DIED
AUD0000000708_S0000813 THE LIZARDS AND THE RATS REPLIED AN-TAK
AUD0000000708_S0000819 I SHALL EAT NOW FOR YOU CANNOT REMAIN AWAKE FOREVER
AUD0000000708_S0000824 FOR A LONG TIME EACH SAT IN SILENCE
AUD0000000708_S0000829 WHAT IS THAT NOISE HE ASKED
AUD0000000708_S0000834 IT RUNS THROUGH THE TEMPLE GROUNDS
AUD0000000708_S0000839 THE WIEROOS DO LIKEWISE WITH THEIR OWN DEAD
AUD0000000708_S0000844 REPLIED AN-TAK
AUD0000000708_S0000849 HOW WOULD YOU
AUD0000000708_S0000854 BUT THE GALU SAID THAT NO WEIROO HAD OCCUPIED THE PLACE SINCE HE HAD BEEN INCARCERATED THERE
AUD0000000708_S0000859 BRADLEY FELT OVER EVERY SQUARE INCH OF THAT AREA WITH THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS
AUD0000000708_S0000864 STEADILY BUT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE
AUD0000000708_S0000869 THE ENGLISHMAN LEANED THROUGH IT AND REACHED HIS ARM AS FAR AS POSSIBLE INTO THE BLACKNESS BUT TOUCHED NOTHING
AUD0000000708_S0000874 YOU HAVE FOUND IT YOU HAVE FOUND THE WAY OUT SCREAMED AN-TAK
AUD0000000708_S0000879 AND NEITHER OF US WILL ESCAPE
AUD0000000708_S0000884 OH LUATA
AUD0000000708_S0000890 AND HE SLIPPED THROUGH THE OPENING
AUD0000000708_S0000895 HE COULD SEE NOTHING OF HIS SURROUNDINGS AND FELT NOTHING BUT THE SMOOTH WORN SIDES AND RUNGS OF THE LADDER DOWN WHICH HE FELT HIS WAY CAUTIOUSLY LEST A BROKEN RUNG OR A MISSTEP SHOULD HURL HIM DOWNWARD
AUD0000000708_S0000900 HE COULD NOT BUT MARVEL AS TO WHERE SO MANY COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF THE THINGS HAD COME FROM UNTIL HE PAUSED TO CONSIDER THAT THE INFANCY OF CASPAK DATED DOUBTLESSLY BACK INTO REMOTE AGES
AUD0000000708_S0000906 STOOPING HE GROPED ABOUT WITH ONE HAND
AUD0000000708_S0000911 AND THAT WAS TO LOWER HIMSELF INTO THE STREAM
AUD0000000708_S0000916 AND THEN WITH A SILENT PRAYER HE LET HIMSELF DROP GENTLY INTO THE STREAM
AUD0000000708_S0000921 FOLLOWING THE WINDING CURVATURES OF THE RIGHT-HAND WALL
AUD0000000708_S0000927 TIME AND AGAIN HIS HAND TOUCHED THEM AND NEVER FOR AN INSTANT COULD HE BE SURE THAT AT THE NEXT STEP SOME GRUESOME THING MIGHT NOT ATTACK HIM
AUD0000000708_S0000932 HE HAD PROMISED TO RETURN FOR AN-TAK IF IT PROVED HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO DO SO
AUD0000000708_S0000937 WITH AN OATH HE PUSHED HIS GRUESOME COMPANION OUT INTO MID-STREAM TO FLOAT ON DOWN TOWARD THE GREAT POOL AND THE AWAITING SCAVENGERS OF THE DEEP
AUD0000000708_S0000942 HE TRIED ALWAYS TO TAKE STEPS OF ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH SO THAT HE KNEW THAT THOUGH CONSIDERABLE TIME HAD ELAPSED YET HE HAD REALLY ADVANCED NO MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YARDS WHEN AHEAD HE SAW A LESSENING OF THE PITCH-DARKNESS
AUD0000000708_S0000948 A MOMENT LATER ANOTHER HEADLESS BODY FLOATED PAST
AUD0000000708_S0000953 ONLY TWO MORE PASSING HIM BEFORE AT SIX HUNDRED STEPS
AUD0000000708_S0000959 DRAWING CLOSER TO THE OPENING LEADING INTO THE BRIGHT DAYLIGHT
AUD0000000708_S0000964 TO AND FRO FLEW WIEROOS GOING TO AND FROM THE TEMPLE
AUD0000000708_S0000969 BRADLEY COULD NOT GUESS UNLESS HE RETRACED HIS STEPS UP THE STREAM AND SOUGHT EGRESS FROM THE OTHER END OF THE CITY
AUD0000000708_S0000974 WITH A GRUNT OF DISGUST HE WAS ABOUT TO PUSH IT FROM HIM WHEN THE WHITE GARMENT ENSHROUDING IT SUGGESTED A BOLD PLAN TO HIS RESOURCEFUL BRAIN
AUD0000000708_S0000979 THROUGH THE WEAVE OF THE CLOTH HE COULD DISTINGUISH LARGE OBJECTS
AUD0000000708_S0000984 AND HE KNEW THAT HE HAD ENTERED BENEATH THE TEMPLE
AUD0000000708_S0000989 AND ONTO THIS HE LOST NO TIME IN CLIMBING
AUD0000000708_S0000994 A FEW FEET ALONG THE PLATFORM A CLOSED DOOR BROKE THE BLANKNESS OF THE WALL
AUD0000000708_S0000999 ITS EYES WERE NOT UPON BRADLEY
AUD0000000708_S0001005 THE WIEROO PAUSED A MOMENT GAZING DOWN INTO THE WATER
AUD0000000708_S0001010 STILL BRADLEY REMAINED AS THOUGH CARVED OF STONE
AUD0000000708_S0001016 WHILE BRADLEY ACTING ALMOST INSTINCTIVELY TO THE URGE OF THE FIRST LAW OF NATURE ROLLED THE INANIMATE BODY OVER THE EDGE INTO THE RIVER
AUD0000000708_S0001021 AND AS HE CROSSED TOWARD IT HE GLANCED INTO SOME OF THE VESSELS WHICH HE FOUND WERE FILLED WITH DRIED FRUITS VEGETABLES AND FISH
AUD0000000708_S0001026 BRADLEY PAUSED AT THE FOOT OF IT
AUD0000000708_S0001031 IN CONFORMITY WITH SUCH WIEROO ARCHITECTURE AS HE HAD ALREADY OBSERVED THE WELL THROUGH WHICH THE LADDER ROSE CONTINUALLY CANTED AT AN ANGLE FROM THE PERPENDICULAR
AUD0000000708_S0001036 AND A GIRL OF HUMAN PROPORTIONS
AUD0000000708_S0001041 TALKING AS HE CAME
AUD0000000708_S0001047 WHILE WITH ME YOU SHALL HAVE LIFE AND FOOD AND NONE SHALL HARM YOU
AUD0000000708_S0001053 AT SIGHT OF THE TWO STRUGGLING UPON THE FLOOR THE NEWCOMER RAISED HIS VOICE IN A SHRIEK OF RAGE
AUD0000000708_S0001059 DREW A WICKED-LOOKING CURVED BLADE FROM BENEATH ITS RED ROBE
AUD0000000708_S0001064 WHILE THE LATTER HOPPED AROUND ON ITS DAINTY WHITE FEET
AUD0000000708_S0001069 IN THE MEANTIME THE GIRL MOVED ABOUT THE ROOM
AUD0000000708_S0001074 AND SO HE WAITED
AUD0000000708_S0001082 INSTANTLY THERE FLASHED INTO HIS MEMORY THE CIRCULAR OPENINGS IN THE ROOF OF THE RIVER VAULT AND THE CORPSES HE HAD SEEN DROP FROM THEM TO THE WATER BENEATH
AUD0000000708_S0001087 YOU SAW AND YOU MUST DIE
AUD0000000708_S0001092 AND BRADLEY WAS SWEPT FROM HIS FEET
AUD0000000708_S0001097 AND AS THE THING CAME CLOSE HE CUT AT THE HIDEOUS FACE WITH ALL THE STRENGTH THAT LAY WITHIN HIM
AUD0000000708_S0001102 HOW CAME YOU HERE
AUD0000000708_S0001107 THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN THEY DROPPED ME INTO THE BLUE PLACE OF SEVEN SKULLS REPLIED BRADLEY
AUD0000000708_S0001112 DON'T BE SO GLUM HE ADMONISHED THE FORMER AS HE CARRIED IT TOWARD THE WELL SMILE
AUD0000000708_S0001117 THE GIRL SHOOK HER HEAD AND EDGED AWAY FROM THE MAN TOWARD THE DOOR
AUD0000000708_S0001122 BRADLEY LAUGHED ALOUD
AUD0000000708_S0001127 SHE SAID THOUGH I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THAT YOU SAY EVEN THOUGH YOU SPEAK MY OWN TONGUE AND USE WORDS THAT I KNOW
AUD0000000708_S0001132 THE GIRL FOLLOWED HIM BUT AT THE DOORWAY BOTH DREW BACK
AUD0000000708_S0001137 WE MAY BE ABLE TO HIDE IN THE NEXT ROOM THERE ARE SKINS THERE BENEATH WHICH WE MAY CRAWL
AUD0000000708_S0001142 WHEN THE ROOM IS ALL BLUE THEY SHUN IT
AUD0000000708_S0001147 THERE ARE MANY SUCH HERE
AUD0000000708_S0001152 WHEN THEY HAVE COMMITTED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MURDERS WITHOUT BEING CAUGHT AT IT
AUD0000000708_S0001159 A MOMENT LATER THEY HEARD A NUMBER OF WIEROOS ENTER THE CHAMBER
AUD0000000708_S0001164 FOR HE COULD NOT KNOW THAT FROM BENEATH ONE OF THE HIDES THAT COVERED HIM PROTRUDED ONE OF HIS HEAVY ARMY SHOES
AUD0000000708_S0001169 AS THEY LED BRADLEY AWAY
AUD0000000708_S0001174 HE FELT RATHER ALL IN HIMSELF
AUD0000000708_S0001182 THE FARTHER THE GROUP PROGRESSED THE MORE BARBARIC AND THE MORE SUMPTUOUS BECAME THE DECORATIONS
AUD0000000708_S0001187 WHILE THICK UPON THE HIDES THAT COVERED THE WALLS WERE GOLDEN ORNAMENTS SIMILAR TO THOSE WORN BY THE GIRL AND THOSE WHICH HAD FILLED THE CHESTS HE HAD EXAMINED IN THE STOREROOM OF FOSH-BAL-SOJ
AUD0000000708_S0001192 AND ALSO AS THEY ADVANCED THE MORE NUMEROUS BECAME THE WIEROOS MOVING HITHER AND THITHER WITHIN THE TEMPLE
AUD0000000708_S0001198 IT MUST BE THE SAME THAT FOSH-BAL-SOJ CAPTURED IN THE STO-LU COUNTRY DURING THE LAST DARKNESS
AUD0000000708_S0001203 ITS POST WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN BY ANOTHER AND BRADLEY NOW SAW THAT AT LEAST TWENTY SUCH GUARDS LOITERED IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY
AUD0000000708_S0001208 ITS DEAD EYES ENTIRELY EXPRESSIONLESS
AUD0000000708_S0001213 THE WALLS OF THE CHAMBER AS WELL AS THE FLOOR WERE ENTIRELY HIDDEN BY SKINS AND WOVEN FABRICS
AUD0000000708_S0001218 AS THE WIEROOS APPROACHED THE FIGURE UPON THE DAIS THEY LEANED FAR FORWARD RAISING THEIR WINGS ABOVE THEIR HEADS AND STRETCHING THEIR NECKS AS THOUGH OFFERING THEM TO THE SHARP SWORDS OF THE GRIM AND HIDEOUS CREATURE
AUD0000000708_S0001223 HIS BLUE ROBE ANNOUNCED HIM THE ONE AND THE SEEMING HUMILITY OF HIS MINIONS THE OTHER
AUD0000000708_S0001229 CAN YOU TELL ME THE SECRET ASKED THE CREATURE
AUD0000000708_S0001234 BRADLEY LEANED FORWARD AND WHISPERED IT IS FOR YOUR EARS ALONE I WILL NOT DIVULGE IT TO OTHERS
AUD0000000708_S0001240 ANYTHING TO GAIN TIME TO GET THE REST OF THE WIEROOS FROM THE ROOM
AUD0000000708_S0001245 THEN GO BUT TELL THE GUARD TO REMAIN CLOSE BY COMMANDED THE HIGH ONE
AUD0000000708_S0001251 BRADLEY WAS RACKING HIS BRAIN TO FIND SOME SUGGESTION OF A PLAN WHEREBY HE MIGHT TURN THE SITUATION TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT
AUD0000000708_S0001256 THE SECRET
AUD0000000708_S0001261 NO CHANGE OF EXPRESSION UPON THE ENGLISHMAN'S COUNTENANCE BETRAYED THAT HE HAD SEEN AUGHT TO SURPRISE HIM
AUD0000000708_S0001267 LEAN CLOSE I WILL WHISPER IT INTO YOUR EAR
AUD0000000708_S0001272 HIS RIGHT HAND UPON THE HILT OF THE SPARE SWORD LYING AT THE LEFT OF HIM WHO SPEAKS FOR LUATA
AUD0000000708_S0001278 THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR EVEN THOUGH WE REACHED MY OWN COUNTRY LUATA CAN FIND YOU OUT
AUD0000000708_S0001283 IF WE DON'T GET OUT OF HERE THOUGH WE'LL DIE RIGHT ENOUGH
AUD0000000708_S0001288 THERE SEEMED NO POSSIBILITY OF ESCAPE
AUD0000000708_S0001293 HERE THE ARCH-FIEND DRAGGED HIS VICTIMS AND CAST THEIR BODIES INTO THE RIVER OF DEATH FAR BELOW
AUD0000000708_S0001298 ALL BELOW WAS DARK AS PITCH BUT AT THE BOTTOM HE KNEW WAS THE RIVER
AUD0000000708_S0001303 AND THEN HE TIED THE ENDS TOGETHER UNTIL HE HAD THREE ROPES ABOUT SEVENTY-FIVE FEET IN LENGTH
AUD0000000708_S0001308 WHEN YOU ARE SAFE BELOW GIVE TWO QUICK JERKS UPON THE ROPE
AUD0000000708_S0001313 AS RAPIDLY AS WAS CONSISTENT WITH SAFETY THE MAN PAID OUT THE ROPE
AUD0000000708_S0001319 THERE CAME TWO QUICK TUGS AT THE ROPE
AUD0000000708_S0001324 A STRANGE THRILL RAN THROUGH HIM AT THE CONTACT BUT HE ONLY CUT THE ROPE FROM ABOUT HER BODY AND LIFTED HER TO THE LITTLE SHELF AT THE RIVER'S SIDE
AUD0000000708_S0001329 I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT BUT OFTEN I HAVE HEARD THEM SPEAK OF IT A CORRIDOR THAT RUNS BESIDE THE RIVER FROM ONE END OF THE CITY TO THE OTHER
AUD0000000708_S0001334 COME SAID BRADLEY
AUD0000000708_S0001342 HE SOUGHT AND FOUND A DOORWAY LEADING OUT ONTO THE RIVER AND THEN STILL IN THE BLACKEST DARKNESS
AUD0000000708_S0001348 BRADLEY COULD NOT BUT MUSE UPON THE JOY OF THE MAN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHEN HE SHOULD DROP DOWN TO HIM WITH FOOD AND A NEW HOPE FOR ESCAPE
AUD0000000708_S0001353 YES THERE WAS THE MAN ASLEEP
AUD0000000708_S0001359 BENEATH THE PERCH HE PAUSED
AUD0000000708_S0001366 SHE TOLD HIM THAT THE WIEROOS SELDOM FREQUENTED THESE LOWER PASSAGES
AUD0000000708_S0001371 WE CAN SEE THEIR EYES SHINING IN THE DARK THEY RESEMBLE DULL SPLOTCHES OF LIGHT
AUD0000000708_S0001376 WHY DO YOU FEAR THEM SO HE ASKED
AUD0000000708_S0001382 THEY HELD NO HATRED FOR ONE ANOTHER
AUD0000000708_S0001388 THEY CALLED THIS TAS-AD WHICH MEANS DOING EVERYTHING THE RIGHT WAY
AUD0000000708_S0001393 IT WAS THEN THAT THE WIEROOS DECIDED TO CARRY TAS-AD INTO EVERY PART OF THE WORLD
AUD0000000708_S0001398 FOR NO ONE WANTED THEIR TAS-AD
AUD0000000708_S0001403 UNTIL AT LAST CAME THE MORE POWERFUL THAN THE OTHERS WITH A TAS-AD ALL HIS OWN
AUD0000000708_S0001408 THEY THINK GREAT THOUGHTS NO DOUBT AND STILL DREAM OF GREATNESS TO COME
AUD0000000708_S0001413 THEN THE CORRIDOR ENDED IN A BLANK WALL BUT IN A NICHE TO THE RIGHT WAS A LADDER LEADING ALOFT
AUD0000000708_S0001418 THERE COULD BE BUT ONE EXPLANATION THEY HAD REACHED A WATERFALL IN THE RIVER
AUD0000000708_S0001423 WHICH WAS THROUGH A WELL SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH HAD LED HIM TO THE UPPER FLOORS OF THE TEMPLE
AUD0000000708_S0001428 AND TOGETHER THEY LOOKED THROUGH THE CRACK INTO A LOW-CEILED CHAMBER IN WHICH WERE SEVERAL GALU WOMEN AND AN EQUAL NUMBER OF HIDEOUS LITTLE REPLICAS OF THE FULL-GROWN WIEROOS WITH WHICH BRADLEY WAS NOT QUITE FAMILIAR
AUD0000000708_S0001435 SEVERAL FEET ABOVE WAS A SECOND DOOR BEYOND WHICH THEY FOUND A SMALL ROOM STORED WITH FOOD IN WOODEN VESSELS
AUD0000000708_S0001440 SHORTLY AFTER THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES THEY HEARD SOMETHING DESCENDING THE LADDER FROM ABOVE
AUD0000000708_S0001445 IT WAS THE WIEROO OF THE YELLOW SLASHING WHOSE ABODE WAS THE PLACE OF THE YELLOW DOOR IN WHICH BRADLEY HAD FIRST SEEN THE GIRL
AUD0000000708_S0001450 WE ARE JUST BELOW THE PLACE OF THE YELLOW DOOR SHE SAID
AUD0000000708_S0001456 REPLIED THE GIRL
AUD0000000708_S0001461 TO FIND THE PISTOL WAS A MATTER OF BUT A MOMENT'S SEARCH ON THE PART OF BRADLEY'S COMPANION AND THEN AT THE ENGLISHMAN'S SIGNAL SHE FOLLOWED HIM TO THE YELLOW DOOR
AUD0000000708_S0001466 WHISPERED THE GIRL
AUD0000000708_S0001471 FOR ONLY THE WIEROOS MAY MURDER ONLY THEY MAY PRACTICE TAS-AD
AUD0000000708_S0001476 YOU STAY RIGHT HERE YOU WON'T BE ANY WORSE OFF THAN BEFORE I CAME AND I'LL GET AS FAR AS I CAN AND ACCOUNT FOR AS MANY OF THE BEGGARS AS POSSIBLE BEFORE THEY GET ME
AUD0000000708_S0001481 I WOULD RATHER DIE
AUD0000000708_S0001487 DO NOT LEAVE ME
AUD0000000708_S0001492 HOW HE MUST HAVE GRIEVED FOR ME
AUD0000000708_S0001497 SO SHE LOVED AN-TAK
AUD0000000708_S0001502 THE ENGLISHMAN SEARCHED AND FOUND THOSE THINGS FOR WHICH HE HAD COME TWO ROBES TWO PAIRS OF DEAD WINGS AND SEVERAL LENGTHS OF FIBER ROPE
AUD0000000708_S0001507 AND THE TWO STEPPED OUT UPON THE ROOF
AUD0000000708_S0001512 WIEROOS FLAPPED ABOVE THEM AND SEVERAL TIMES THEY PASSED OTHERS WALKING OR SITTING UPON THE ROOFS
AUD0000000708_S0001517 THEY THINK THAT WE CANNOT ESCAPE THE CITY
AUD0000000708_S0001523 AND IN SILENCE THEY CONTINUED UNTIL THE OUTER EDGE OF ROOFS WAS VISIBLE BEFORE THEM
AUD0000000708_S0001529 TO BE SEEN ATTEMPTING TO DESCEND TO THE GROUND BELOW WOULD BE TO BETRAY THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT WIEROOS
AUD0000000708_S0001534 THEN THEY WAITED
AUD0000000708_S0001540 AT NO TIME DID THEY HEAR THE CRY OF A CARNIVORE
AUD0000000708_S0001545 WHEN THE WIEROOS FIRST DEVELOPED WINGS UPON WHICH THEY COULD FLY
AUD0000000708_S0001550 AS IT WILL US SUGGESTED BRADLEY
AUD0000000708_S0001556 NOT WISHING TO LEAVE THE STREAM THE TWO WADED ALONG ITS BED TO A SPOT WHERE THE GORGE WIDENED BETWEEN PERPENDICULAR BLUFFS TO A WOODED ACRE OF LEVEL LAND
AUD0000000708_S0001561 FOR THREE DAYS THEY RESTED HERE BEFORE TRYING TO EXPLORE THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY
AUD0000000708_S0001569 AMONG OTHER PLANS BRADLEY HAD THOUGHT OF CONSTRUCTING A COVERED RAFT UPON WHICH THEY MIGHT DRIFT TO THE MAINLAND BUT AS SUCH A CONTRIVANCE WOULD NECESSARILY BE OF CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT
AUD0000000708_S0001574 WE HAVE ESCAPED FROM DEATH FOR A TIME AT LEAST
AUD0000000708_S0001579 I DO SHE SAID
AUD0000000708_S0001584 HE TURNED THEN AND LOOKED AT THE GIRL
AUD0000000708_S0001590 YET THERE HAD BEEN A DIFFERENCE HE RECALLED NOW THE STRANGE SENSATION OF ELATION THAT HAD THRILLED HIM UPON THE OCCASIONS WHEN THE GIRL HAD PRESSED HIS HAND IN HERS AND THE DEPRESSION THAT HAD FOLLOWED HER ANNOUNCEMENT OF HER LOVE FOR AN-TAK
AUD0000000708_S0001595 AND THE DAYS CAME AND WENT AND THE MAN FASHIONED SPEAR AND BOW AND ARROWS AND HUNTED WITH THEM THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE MEAT
AUD0000000708_S0001600 SHE WAS ALWAYS THE SAME SWEET AND KIND AND HELPFUL BUT ALWAYS THERE WAS ABOUT HER MANNER AND HER EXPRESSION JUST A TRACE OF WISTFULNESS
AUD0000000708_S0001605 HE BROUGHT WOOD FOR THEIR COOK-FIRE WHICH THEY USED ONLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY A TIME WHEN THERE WAS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF WIEROOS BEING IN THE AIR SO FAR FROM THEIR CITY AND THEN HE LEARNED TO BANK IT WITH EARTH IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE EMBERS HELD UNTIL THE FOLLOWING NOON WITHOUT GIVING OFF SMOKE
AUD0000000708_S0001610 I DO NOT KNOW WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM
AUD0000000708_S0001615 IF EITHER OF US MUST GO ALONE IT WILL BE YOU
AUD0000000708_S0001620 MY BROTHER SHE REPLIED WHY
AUD0000000708_S0001625 SHE DREW AWAY
AUD0000000708_S0001632 AND THE MONTHS FOLLOWED ONE ANOTHER IN A LAZY PROCESSION OF HOT
AUD0000000708_S0001638 AND SO HE TAUGHT HER TO SWIM SHE WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST HUMAN BEING IN ALL CASPAK'S LONG AGES WHO HAD DONE THIS THING
AUD0000000708_S0001644 MAKING NEW AND BETTER WEAPONS
AUD0000000708_S0001649 BRADLEY WAS JUST EMERGING FROM THE WATER AFTER HIS MORNING PLUNGE WHEN FROM OVERHEAD CAME THE SOUND OF FLAPPING WINGS
AUD0000000708_S0001654 AWAITING THE MOMENT WHEN THE HUNTERS WOULD COME FOR THEM BUT NOTHING HAPPENED UNTIL JUST AFTER DAWN OF THE THIRD DAY
AUD0000000708_S0001659 FOLLOWING A PLAN ALREADY DISCUSSED BRADLEY AND THE GIRL RETREATED SLOWLY INTO THE WOODS
AUD0000000708_S0001665 AWAITING THE MOMENT WHEN THEY SHOULD BE BEYOND THE TREES AND ABLE TO USE THEIR WINGS
AUD0000000708_S0001671 AND HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO CHANCE WASTING AMMUNITION ON MISSES
AUD0000000708_S0001676 THE SPREADING OF THEIR WINGS PROVED THEIR UNDOING IT HINDERED AND STOPPED THEM AND THREW THEM TO THE GROUND
AUD0000000708_S0001681 QUICK OR I KILL
AUD0000000708_S0001686 NOW APPROACH
AUD0000000708_S0001691 SHE DID AS HE BID
AUD0000000708_S0001696 AND REMEMBER THAT I AM WALKING CLOSE BEHIND AND THAT I WILL SHOOT THE NEARER ONE SHOULD EITHER ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE THAT WILL HOLD THE OTHER UNTIL I CAN KILL HIM AS WELL
AUD0000000708_S0001702 YOU SHALL BOTH DIE
AUD0000000708_S0001707 DO YOU AGREE
AUD0000000708_S0001714 NOR OF THOSE OTHER MENACES WHICH HE HAD FEARED MIGHT BRING DISASTER TO HIS PLANS FOR ESCAPE THE HUGE WINGED REPTILIA THAT ARE SO NUMEROUS ABOVE THE SOUTHERN AREAS OF CASPAK AND WHICH ARE OFTEN SEEN
AUD0000000708_S0001719 THE ROARS AND SCREAMS AND GROWLS OF GIANT CARNIVORA CAME FAINTLY TO THEIR EARS
AUD0000000708_S0001726 WHEN THE CREATURES HAD GONE THE GIRL TURNED TOWARD BRADLEY
AUD0000000708_S0001731 THERE WERE TWO REASONS REPLIED BRADLEY
AUD0000000708_S0001737 AND YOU ASKED THE GIRL
AUD0000000708_S0001742 WHEN HE RAISED HIS EYES AGAIN SHE WAS SMILING
AUD0000000708_S0001747 IT WAS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE GIRL SUDDENLY SEIZED BRADLEY'S ARM AND POINTED STRAIGHT AHEAD ALONG THE SHORE
AUD0000000708_S0001752 AND THEN HE SEIZED HER WRIST AND DREW HER QUICKLY BEHIND A CLUMP OF BUSHES
AUD0000000708_S0001758 THE THING THAT SWIMS UNDER THE WATER AND CARRIES MEN IN ITS BELLY
AUD0000000708_S0001763 MANY MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AMONG MY FRIENDS HE REPLIED
AUD0000000708_S0001768 WHEN I LEFT THERE WERE MORE GERMANS ON THE U THIRTY THREE THAN THERE WERE MEN OF MY OWN PARTY AT THE FORT
AUD0000000708_S0001773 AND WATCHED THE BOAT FOR SIGNS OF HUMAN LIFE ABOUT IT
AUD0000000708_S0001779 THE VOICE DID NOT COME FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE U-BOAT BUT FROM INLAND
AUD0000000708_S0001785 NOR OF THE PERFIDY OF THE GERMANS IN SHELLING THE FORT AND ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE IN THE U THIRTY THREE BUT HE WAS IN NO WAY SURPRISED AT WHAT HE SAW BEFORE HIM
AUD0000000708_S0001791 DIETZ HEINZ AND KLATZ ALSO SEEMED TO ENJOY THE ENTERTAINMENT IMMENSELY BUT TWO OF THE MEN PLESSER AND HINDLE MARCHED WITH EYES STRAIGHT TO THE FRONT AND WITH SCOWLING FACES
AUD0000000708_S0001796 STAY HERE HE WHISPERED
AUD0000000708_S0001801 THE GIRL PRESSED CLOSE TO HIM HER FACE VERY WHITE
AUD0000000708_S0001806 HE EJACULATED
AUD0000000708_S0001812 THEN HE ROSE AND LEAPED QUICKLY AND SILENTLY FROM THE JUNGLE SUDDENLY VON SCHOENVORTS FELT AN ARM THROWN ABOUT HIS NECK AND HIS PISTOL JERKED FROM ITS HOLSTER
AUD0000000708_S0001817 THE GERMANS HESITATED FOR A MOMENT LOOKING FIRST TOWARD VON SCHOENVORTS AND THEN TO SCHWARTZ WHO WAS EVIDENTLY SECOND IN COMMAND FOR ORDERS
AUD0000000708_S0001823 SUDDENLY VON SCHOENVORTS WHEELED ABOUT AND SEIZED BRADLEY'S PISTOL ARM WITH BOTH HANDS
AUD0000000708_S0001829 OLSON AND BRADY WERE NOT LONG IN ACTING UPON THE SUGGESTION
AUD0000000708_S0001834 BRADY AND OLSON WERE CHARGING THE GERMANS IN THE REAR WITH WILSON WHITELY AND SINCLAIR SUPPORTING THEM WITH BARE FISTS
AUD0000000708_S0001840 HEINZ AND KLATZ POSSIBLY INFLUENCED BY THEIR EXHORTATION
AUD0000000708_S0001845 AND THOUGH UNUSED TO THE LONG GERMAN RIFLE AND BAYONET HE MET THE BULL-RUSH OF THE HUN WITH THE COLD CRUEL PRECISION AND SCIENCE OF ENGLISH BAYONET-FIGHTING
AUD0000000708_S0001850 INSTANTLY HE STEPPED CLOSE IN
AUD0000000708_S0001855 VON SCHOENVORTS STILL LAY WHERE HE HAD FALLEN
AUD0000000708_S0001861 CO-TAN HE SAID

AUD0000000708_S0001871 VON SCHOENVORTS' FACE WAS LIVID WITH FEAR
AUD0000000708_S0001876 YOU MURDERED SCHWERKE YOU DROVE HIM INSANE BY YOUR CRUELTY UNTIL HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE

AUD0000000708_S0001924 LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF A NUMBER OF BAND-LU WARRIORS BUT WHEN THE VESSEL APPROACHED THE SHORE AND THE NATIVES REALIZED THAT HUMAN BEINGS STOOD UPON THE BACK OF THE STRANGE MONSTER OF THE SEA THEY FLED IN TERROR BEFORE BRADLEY COULD COME WITHIN HAILING DISTANCE
AUD0000000708_S0001930 HERE THEY WERE ATTACKED BY THE BOW-AND-ARROW MEN
AUD0000000708_S0001935 BUT THEY CONTINUED ON THEIR FRUITLESS QUEST AND THE THIRD DAY AFTER CRUISING ALONG THE SHORE OF A DEEP INLET

AUD0000000708_S0001955 SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN WIDE-EYED WONDER
AUD0000000708_S0001960 BUT EACH ONE WRUNG FROM A WOMAN'S HEART
AUD0000000708_S0001966 NOR DID HE NEED MORE THAN THE WONDERFUL NEW LIGHT IN HER EYES TO TELL HIM THAT SHE WOULD GO TO THE END OF THE WORLD WITH HIM IF HE WOULD BUT TAKE HER
AUD0000000708_S0001971 THEY ARE GALUS

AUD0000000708_S0002012 AND LOOKING CLOSELY HE SAW A HORSE BEARING TWO FIGURES SLIDING DOWN THE STEEP DECLIVITY
AUD0000000708_S0002017 WHEN THE GIRL ESPIED THE LATTER SHE SLID FROM THE HORSE AND RAN TOWARD HER FAIRLY SCREAMING FOR JOY

AUD0000000820_S0000629 AND THEN SHE WOULD GO ABOUT THE HOUSE WITH AN EXPRESSION ON HER FACE WHICH WAS A SOURCE OF GREAT SECRET ANNOYANCE TO MISS MINCHIN
AUD0000000820_S0000634 WHILE SHE WAS IN THE MIDST OF SOME HARSH AND CRUEL SPEECH
AUD0000000820_S0000639 I ONLY SPARE YOU BECAUSE I AM A PRINCESS

AUD0000000820_S0000686 THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WERE DOING
AUD0000000820_S0000691 AND I WAS THINKING THAT IF I WERE ONE
AUD0000000820_S0000696 IT ALMOST SEEMED FOR THE MOMENT TO HER NARROW UNIMAGINATIVE MIND THAT THERE MUST BE SOME REAL POWER BEHIND THIS CANDID DARING
AUD0000000820_S0000701 GO TO YOUR ROOM

AUD0000000820_S0000773 SO SHE CROSSED THE PAVEMENT AND PUT HER WET FOOT ON THE STEP OF THE SHOP AND AS SHE DID SO SHE SAW SOMETHING WHICH MADE HER STOP
AUD0000000820_S0000778 WITH BIG HOLLOW HUNGRY EYES
AUD0000000820_S0000783 THE CHILD THIS ONE OF THE POPULACE STARED UP AT SARA

AUD0000000820_S0000997 PERHAPS HE SAVED HIS MASTER'S LIFE IN THE SEPOY REBELLION SHE THOUGHT
AUD0000000820_S0001002 AND HIS START AT THE SOUND OF HIS OWN LANGUAGE EXPRESSED A GREAT DEAL OF SURPRISE AND DELIGHT
AUD0000000820_S0001007 WHEN HIS MASTER CAME OUT

AUD0000000847_S0000673 AND WITH A FURTHER NATURAL AND EASY TRANSITION REACH THE GRAND THEME OF THE GLORIOUS OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY A PHILANTHROPICAL OXFORD STREET TO A GASPING AND EXCITED PUBLIC
AUD0000000847_S0000680 BUT NOW THE MISTS ROLL AWAY AND I SEE AS IT WERE REMOTE PEAKS OF DELICATE AND IMPLICATING ADVERTISING THE EXISTENCE OF WHICH I HAD NEVER SUSPECTED
AUD0000000847_S0000688 IT IS A LETTER THAT I READ OFTEN AND VALUE HIGHLY
AUD0000000847_S0000693 TO BE PUBLISHED IN CASE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY SHOULD SET IN
AUD0000000847_S0000699 THROUGH NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN
AUD0000000847_S0000704 THOUGH WITH RATHER TOO MUCH TENDENCY TO BACK-CHAT
AUD0000000847_S0000710 YOU ARE MUCH MISSED
AUD0000000847_S0000716 HIS LORDSHIP'S HAD ONE FIT OF HIS TANTRUMS
AUD0000000847_S0000722 UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT EVERYBODY WHO WILL PUT INTO WRITING
AUD0000000847_S0000727 I ASKED HIM TO SEND HIS OPINION OF ME AS I THOUGHT OF MAKING A BOOK
AUD0000000847_S0000733 I HAVE THE COURAGE OF MY OPINIONS
AUD0000000847_S0000740 HE SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
AUD0000000847_S0000745 SHE IS WONDERFUL WONDERFUL
AUD0000000847_S0000750 POOR CHLORINE KNOWS NO FRENCH
AUD0000000847_S0000757 BUT SHE IS MORE LIKELY TO GO DOWN TO POSTERITY AS THE SUBJECT OF MY ART
AUD0000000847_S0000764 TO PREVENT ANY POSSIBILITY OF INCREDULITY
AUD0000000847_S0000770 SHE AT LAST PUT THROUGH A CALL TO SIR HERBERT TAYLOR
AUD0000000847_S0000776 WHAT WHAT WHAT
AUD0000000847_S0000781 IF I'D HAD MY OWN WAY THOUGH BETWEEN OURSELVES WHAT WHAT I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED SARAH
AUD0000000847_S0000786 KICKED AGAINST IT ALL MY LIFE
AUD0000000847_S0000794 PLENTY OF COURAGE
AUD0000000847_S0000800 WROTE AN ARTICLE ABOUT THEM
AUD0000000847_S0000806 BUT POSSIBLY FROM HABITS OF ECONOMY HE DID NOT I HAVE NOT GIVEN HIS NAME
AUD0000000847_S0000811 IF I COULD ONLY FEEL THAT FOR ONCE I HAD DONE THAT
AUD0000000847_S0000816 WIPE YOUR FEET
AUD0000000847_S0000824 PERVADING GLOW OF SATISFACTION THAT OBTAIN FROM A MORE NARCISSAN PROCEDURE
AUD0000000847_S0000833 DOES THIS MEAN THAT SHE DOES NOT PROPOSE TO TREAT HERSELF AS IF SHE WERE MR BERNARD SHAW
AUD0000000847_S0000838 BUT IF SHE HAD MEANT THAT
AUD0000000847_S0000845 BUT IN ITS SEVENTEENTH CHAPTER
AUD0000000847_S0000852 SHE MUST BE RIGHT
AUD0000000847_S0000861 NO NEVER MIND
AUD0000000847_S0000867 BESIDES
AUD0000000847_S0000872 THE EXPLANATION IS QUITE SIMPLE
AUD0000000847_S0000878 THERE IS JUST ONE QUALITY WHICH I CLAIM TO HAVE IN AN EVEN GREATER DEGREE THAN MY PROTOTYPE
AUD0000000847_S0000883 MORE IMPOSSIBILITY
AUD0000000847_S0000888 I HAVE IMAGINATION OF A CERTAIN KIND
AUD0000000847_S0000893 BUTTERSCOTCH
AUD0000000847_S0000899 SAID THE DEAN
AUD0000000847_S0000904 YES HE SAID WEARILY
AUD0000000847_S0000909 WRONG AGAIN
AUD0000000847_S0000917 THE IMAGINATION IS SOMETHING THAT RUNS AWAY WITH YOU
AUD0000000847_S0000924 THEY WILL HELP ME TO IMPROVE MYSELF
AUD0000000847_S0000929 WHEN YOU HAVE NOT GOT ENOUGH OF ANYTHING
AUD0000000847_S0000935 ANYHOW
AUD0000000847_S0000941 I AM TOO IMPULSIVE I HAVE ALWAYS SAID SO
AUD0000000847_S0000946 AND EVEN THE MURDERS SUCH AS THEY WERE WERE MORE THE FAULT OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES THAN OF MYSELF
AUD0000000847_S0000955 MY REVERED MODEL WROTE THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A COLLECTOR OF LETTERS OLD PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE FAMILY FAMOUS PEOPLE AND ODDS AND ENDS
AUD0000000847_S0000960 I SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT IS BEST TO KEEP THEM IN SPIRITS OF WINE
AUD0000000847_S0000965 ANOTHER DIFFICULTY IS THAT THE ORDINARY CYANIDE BOTTLES THAT YOU BUY AT THE NATURALIST'S THOUGH EXCELLENT FOR MOTHS
AUD0000000847_S0000970 I NEED EXPERT ADVICE
AUD0000000847_S0000975 DOWNRIGHT AND TRUTHFUL TO PUT UP WITH ANYTHING LESS THAN THE REAL THING
AUD0000000847_S0000983 IT IS NOT OF THE LEAST USE TO PUT TREACLE ON THE TREES
AUD0000000847_S0000992 POURING ADULATORY ARTICLES OVER EACH OTHER
AUD0000000847_S0000999 AND OCCASIONALLY THE LAST BUS
AUD0000000847_S0001005 BUT I USED SOME TO GET CHOCOLATES OUT OF THE AUTOMATIC MACHINES
AUD0000000847_S0001010 THE E FLAT CLARIONET IS NOT REALLY MY INSTRUMENT
AUD0000000847_S0001016 THOUGH I MIGHT CONCEIVABLY WRITE IT MORE CORRECTLY
AUD0000000847_S0001024 LATE EXTRA
AUD0000000847_S0001029 THE PRINCIPAL DIFFERENCE WOULD APPEAR TO BE THAT A RESPECTABLE LAUNDRESS DOES KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE
AUD0000000847_S0001037 I WANTED TOO
AUD0000000847_S0001044 THIS IS WHERE THE COMPLETED ARTICLES ARE PACKED FOR DELIVERY
AUD0000000847_S0001049 OUR SKILL IN CREATING ODD SOCKS AND STOCKINGS WAS GRATEFULLY RECOGNIZED BY THE AMALGAMATED HOSIERS' INSTITUTION
AUD0000000847_S0001055 THE REST IS MERELY INCIDENTAL
AUD0000000847_S0001062 AS ONE OF OUR DIRECTORS A MAN WITH A FINE SCHOLARLY HEAD ONCE SAID TO ME BRING THE LARGER VISION INTO THE ADDITION OF A CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT
AUD0000000847_S0001068 THIS WAS ALL IN ACCORD WITH THE FAR-SEEING AND GENEROUS POLICY OF THE LAUNDRY
AUD0000000847_S0001076 IT DID
AUD0000000847_S0001083 HE WAS OF COURSE
AUD0000000847_S0001089 HE WAS A CULTURED IDEALIST
AUD0000000847_S0001095 AND ADDED THIS BEAUTIFUL THOUGHT IN THE ORDEAL BY LAUNDRY THE SOFT-FRONTED OFTEN OUTLASTS THE STARCHED
AUD0000000847_S0001102 I ONCE HELD A SUBORDINATE POSITION IN THE LAUNDRY
AUD0000000847_S0001108 BUT IN IMAGINATION AND IT WAS JUST THERE THAT THE TACTLESS WAITRESS INTERRUPTED US SO RUDELY
AUD0000000847_S0001115 THE CLOCK AT THE POST-OFFICE GAVE HIM THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRED
AUD0000000847_S0001121 SHOVING BEHIND
AUD0000000847_S0001126 AND I'D SEEN THE CHARLIE CHAPLIN ONE BEFORE
AUD0000000847_S0001135 AND WAS ACCORDED
AUD0000000847_S0001142 EVERYBODY KNEW WELL THAT HECTOR WAS MARKED OUT FOR A GREAT POSITION
AUD0000000847_S0001149 MR CASHMERE EXPRESSED THE HIGHEST OPINION OF HECTOR
AUD0000000847_S0001154 WHILE REMAINING ON THE BEST POSSIBLE SOCIAL TERMS WITH THE CHAIRMAN SIR CHARLES CHEVIOT
AUD0000000847_S0001159 AND A RUPTURE WAS IMMINENT
AUD0000000847_S0001164 AND THAT HECTOR WOULD GET THE VACANT PLACE
AUD0000000847_S0001170 BUT IN THE INTERESTS OF THE SHAREHOLDERS WE DO NOT WISH THAT TO BE GENERALLY KNOWN
AUD0000000847_S0001175 IT WAS A GREAT POSITION HAD I ANY RIGHT TO REFUSE IT
AUD0000000847_S0001180 PEOPLE HAVE LOST FORTUNES BY OPENING THEIR MOUTHS TOO WIDE
AUD0000000847_S0001187 DO BE PATIENT
AUD0000000847_S0001196 I WAS TOLD THAT IN THE DIGNIFIED POSITION WHICH WAS TO BE MINE I MUST GIVE UP LARKING ABOUT AND THE USE OF WICKED WORDS WHEN IRRITATED
AUD0000000847_S0001202 I HAVE LIVED LONG
AUD0000000847_S0001207 IT GIVES HIM OR HER COMPLETE SATISFACTION
AUD0000000847_S0001212 THIS WOULD BE A MISERABLE MARRIAGE
AUD0000000847_S0001217 AND MOSTLY WOULD RESENT BEING TOLD IT
AUD0000000847_S0001222 MR J A BANTING SENT ME A TRAVELLING-CLOCK AT ONE TIME THE PROPERTY OF LORD BARINGSTOKE
AUD0000000847_S0001227 SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT ONE OF MY BROTHERS
AUD0000000847_S0001234 I CAN HARDLY BRING MYSELF TO WRITE OF IT
AUD0000000847_S0001239 THE TENDENCY OF A MRS HARRIS TO BECOME MYTHICAL WAS FIRST NOTICED BY AN ENGLISH WRITER OF SOME REPUTE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
AUD0000000847_S0001244 BUT I BECAME AWARE THAT I NEVER HAD
AUD0000000847_S0001249 I FADED AWAY
AUD0000000877_S0000043 TOINETTE
AUD0000000877_S0000060 TOINETTE
AUD0000000877_S0000065 TOINETTE
AUD0000000877_S0000070 YES I HAVE SOME SLIGHT IDEA THAT YOU WANT TO SPEAK OF OUR YOUNG LOVER
AUD0000000877_S0000075 YOU DON'T GIVE ME TIME AND YOU ARE SO EAGER THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO BE BEFOREHAND WITH YOU ON THE SUBJECT
AUD0000000877_S0000080 I AM FAR FROM DOING SO
AUD0000000877_S0000085 TELL ME
AUD0000000877_S0000092 DO YOU NOT THINK TOINETTE THAT HE IS VERY HANDSOME
AUD0000000877_S0000097 MOST CERTAINLY
AUD0000000877_S0000103 YOU ARE RIGHT
AUD0000000877_S0000109 AH TOINETTE WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THERE
AUD0000000877_S0000114 AND THE RESOLUTION WHICH HE SAYS HE HAS TAKEN OF ASKING YOU IN MARRIAGE
AUD0000000877_S0000122 TOINETTE
AUD0000000877_S0000130 THERE IS NOTHING SO FUNNY TO YOUNG GIRLS
AUD0000000877_S0000136 AND I HAVE PROMISED YOU
AUD0000000877_S0000141 SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN BENT UPON THAT
AUD0000000877_S0000223 YES HE CAN
AUD0000000877_S0000231 ANGELIQUE
AUD0000000877_S0000257 I COULD HAVE GONE TO YOUR HOUSE
AUD0000000877_S0000271 SINCE WE SEE IN YOU STEPS
AUD0000000877_S0000288 AND THAT ALL THOSE WHO SEE HIM SPEAK OF HIM AS OF A YOUTH WITHOUT GUILE
AUD0000000877_S0000293 HE WAS ALWAYS GENTLE PEACEFUL TACITURN
AUD0000000877_S0000298 TREES SLOW OF GROWTH BEAR THE BEST FRUIT
AUD0000000877_S0000303 WHEN I SENT HIM TO COLLEGE
AUD0000000877_S0000308 IN SHORT
AUD0000000877_S0000313 THERE HE HAS RENDERED HIMSELF FORMIDABLE
AUD0000000877_S0000318 AND PURSUES AN ARGUMENT TO THE LAST RECESSES OF LOGIC
AUD0000000877_S0000332 THERE IS YOUR PART
AUD0000000877_S0000339 VERY WELL LET US HEAR
AUD0000000877_S0000346 HE CAME NEAR THE SHEPHERDESS TO COMFORT HER
AUD0000000877_S0000351 HE ENDEAVOURS TO STOP THOSE BEAUTIFUL TEARS
AUD0000000877_S0000357 THE WHOLE PLAY WAS ACTED WITHOUT HIS PAYING ANY MORE ATTENTION TO IT YET HE COMPLAINS THAT IT WAS TOO SHORT
AUD0000000877_S0000364 BUT THE GREAT WATCH WHICH IS KEPT OVER HIS SHEPHERDESS DEPRIVES HIM OF ALL THE POWER OF DOING SO
AUD0000000877_S0000369 AND THAT EVERYTHING IS BEING GOT READY TO CELEBRATE THE WEDDING
AUD0000000877_S0000374 AS IF ALREADY ASSURED OF HIS CONQUEST
AUD0000000877_S0000379 AND THE GREATNESS OF HIS LOVE FORCES HIM TO SPEAK AS FOLLOWS
AUD0000000877_S0000390 MY EYES I LIFT TO HEAVEN I STRIVE TO PRAY
AUD0000000877_S0000399 O BLESSED WORDS
AUD0000000877_S0000407 ALAS
AUD0000000877_S0000415 CAN YOU POSSESS A HAPPINESS MORE SWEET
AUD0000000877_S0000422 AND MARS MY BLISS
AUD0000000877_S0000427 THEN THAT FATHER IS A FOOL TO PUT UP WITH THOSE SILLY THINGS
AUD0000000877_S0000434 AND WHERE ARE THE WORDS THAT YOU HAVE JUST SUNG THIS IS ONLY THE MUSIC
AUD0000000877_S0000439 THOUGHT I SHOULD AMUSE YOU
AUD0000000877_S0000447 TOINETTE
AUD0000000877_S0000453 I AM DELIGHTED TO HAVE COME HERE JUST IN TIME TO SEE YOU
AUD0000000877_S0000459 KEEP IT FOR ANOTHER TIME
AUD0000000877_S0000465 AND PLEDGE HIM YOUR TROTH
AUD0000000877_S0000471 AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED MADAM
AUD0000000877_S0000476 OH NONSENSE THERE WILL BE TIME ENOUGH FOR THE IMPRESSION TO BE MADE AFTER YOU ARE MARRIED
AUD0000000877_S0000481 NEGO CONSEQUENTIAM
AUD0000000877_S0000486 SO THAT THE LATTER MIGHT NOT SEEM TO FLY OF HER OWN ACCORD INTO THE ARMS OF A MAN
AUD0000000877_S0000492 BUT WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE INTEREST OF MY LOVE
AUD0000000877_S0000511 I AM SORRY TO LEAVE YOU MY CHILD BUT I HAVE SOME IMPORTANT BUSINESS WHICH CALLS ME TO TOWN
AUD0000000877_S0000518 HOW MUCH THIS WOMAN LOVES ME IT IS PERFECTLY INCREDIBLE
AUD0000000877_S0000534 MY STEP-MAMMA TOLD ME TO COME TO YOU
AUD0000000877_S0000539 WELL
AUD0000000877_S0000544 YES

AUD0000000877_S0000554 HAVE I NOT ASKED YOU TO TELL ME AT ONCE ALL YOU SEE

AUD0000000877_S0000565 I WILL MAKE YOU SEE SOMETHING SOON
AUD0000000877_S0000584 A CURSE ON THE ROD
AUD0000000877_S0000590 WELL
AUD0000000877_S0000595 AND IT WILL TELL ME IF YOU DON'T SPEAK THE TRUTH
AUD0000000877_S0000604 SHE SAID TO HIM
AUD0000000877_S0000609 BUT HE WOULD NOT GO AWAY
AUD0000000877_S0000614 AND THEN AFTER
AUD0000000877_S0000619 THEN MY MAMMA CAME TO THE DOOR AND HE ESCAPED
AUD0000000877_S0000626 AH
AUD0000000877_S0000631 WHICH SAYS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING YOU SAW
AUD0000000877_S0000638 WELL
AUD0000000877_S0000643 I HAVE NOT EVEN ENOUGH LEISURE TO ATTEND TO MY ILLNESS
AUD0000000877_S0000652 THAT'S A SAD THING INDEED
AUD0000000877_S0000722 I WAS ABOUT TO CLEANSE YOUR BODY AND TO CLEAR IT OF ITS BAD HUMOURS
AUD0000000877_S0000728 SINCE YOU HAVE FORSAKEN THE OBEDIENCE YOU OWE TO YOUR DOCTOR
AUD0000000877_S0000733 TO THE IMTEMPERAMENT OF YOUR INTESTINES
AUD0000000877_S0000739 AND I WILL HAVE YOU BEFORE FOUR DAYS IN AN INCURABLE STATE
AUD0000000877_S0000745 MR PURGON
AUD0000000877_S0000752 MR PURGON
AUD0000000877_S0000758 WHY
AUD0000000877_S0000763 AND I WOULD NOT FOR A GREAT DEAL THAT YOU SHOULD BE SEEN ACTING AS YOU ARE DOING
AUD0000000877_S0000768 HE SAYS THAT I SHALL BECOME INCURABLE WITHIN FOUR DAYS
AUD0000000877_S0000774 AND THAT ALL THE WRATH OF MR PURGON CAN DO AS LITTLE TOWARDS MAKING YOU DIE
AUD0000000877_S0000782 TOINETTE
AUD0000000877_S0000792 I FORGOT TO GIVE A SMALL ORDER TO MY SERVANT
AUD0000000877_S0000800 WHAT DO YOU WANT SIR
AUD0000000877_S0000806 JUST STOP HERE ONE MOMENT AND SEE HOW MUCH THAT DOCTOR IS LIKE YOU
AUD0000000877_S0000813 FOR MY PART
AUD0000000877_S0000856 YOU WILL SEE WHAT GRIEF SHE WILL BE IN WHEN I TELL HER THE NEWS
AUD0000000877_S0000886 AND KISS YOU AS A PROOF OF MY REPENTANCE
AUD0000000877_S0000899 AND I WOULD DO MUCH MORE TO OBTAIN FROM YOU THE FAIR ANGELIQUE
AUD0000000877_S0000905 I IMAGINE BROTHER THAT YOU ARE LAUGHING AT ME
AUD0000000877_S0000912 WHAT
AUD0000000877_S0000917 LOOK YOU SIR A BEARD IS SOMETHING IN ITSELF A BEARD IS HALF THE DOCTOR
AUD0000000931_S0000010 SO EASILY DISGUISED ON THE STAGE OR THE MUSIC-STOOL EVEN BY ADULTS IS MORE OBVIOUS IN THE FIELD OF PURE INTELLECT
AUD0000000931_S0000016 BUT IT HAPPENS TO POSSESS AN EXTRANEOUS VALUE
AUD0000000931_S0000021 MARY ANTIN'S VIVID DESCRIPTION OF ALL SHE AND HER DEAR ONES WENT THROUGH
AUD0000000931_S0000026 HER KEEN POWERS OF OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION
AUD0000000931_S0000031 AND SHE HAS ALREADY PRODUCED IN IT PASSAGES OF TRUE LITERATURE
AUD0000000931_S0000036 IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE LYRICAL SHAPE
AUD0000000931_S0000041 BUT I HAVE VENTURED TO COUNSEL DELAY RATHER THAN PRECIPITATION IN PRODUCTION FOR SHE IS NOT YET SIXTEEN AND THE COMPLETION OF HER EDUCATION
AUD0000000931_S0000046 THAT I HAVE NEITHER ADDED NOR SUBTRACTED EVEN A COMMA
AUD0000000931_S0000053 CARRYING WITH IT A VAST NUMBER OF THE JEWISH POPULATION TO THE DISTANT SHORES OF THE NEW WORLD FROM TYRANNY TO DEMOCRACY
AUD0000000931_S0000058 THE DIFFERENT CURRENTS THAT DIRECTED THE COURSE OF THAT WAVE CANNOT BE HERE ENUMERATED
AUD0000000931_S0000063 THE EMIGRATION FEVER WAS AT ITS HEIGHT IN PLOTZK MY NATIVE TOWN
AUD0000000931_S0000069 AND PROPHESIED NO GOOD FOR THOSE WHO BRAVED THE TERRORS OF THE SEA AND THE FOREIGN GOAL BEYOND IT
AUD0000000931_S0000086 WE DARED NOT BRAVE THE SYMPATHETIC PRESENCE OF THE WHOLE TOWNSHIP
AUD0000000931_S0000091 I REMEMBER HOW THE WOMEN CROWDED AROUND MOTHER
AUD0000000931_S0000097 HUGS AND GOOD WISHES
AUD0000000931_S0000102 AND WE THE WANDERERS COULD SCARCELY SEE THE RAINBOW WAVE OF COLORED HANDKERCHIEFS
AUD0000000931_S0000107 KNOWLEDGE
AUD0000000931_S0000112 AS I WROTE IT FOUR YEARS AGO
AUD0000000931_S0000121 DO A GREAT DEAL OF BUSTLING AND HURRYING AND QUESTIONING OF PORTERS AND MERE IDLERS
AUD0000000931_S0000126 I DO NOT CLEARLY REMEMBER JUST WHAT OCCURRED
AUD0000000931_S0000131 AND I DO NOT KNOW TO THIS DAY HOW MOTHER MANAGED TO GET AWAY FROM THE MOB AND HOW ABOVE ALL SHE DARED TO TRUST HERSELF WITH HER PRECIOUS BAGGAGE TO ONE OF THEM
AUD0000000931_S0000136 OUR STAY IN VILNA WAS MARKED BY NOTHING OF INTEREST
AUD0000000931_S0000141 THE SAME KIND OF STOREKEEPERS IN THE LOW STORE DOORS FOREVER STRUGGLING AND QUARRELLING FOR A CUSTOMER
AUD0000000931_S0000146 THE LATTER OBJECT MAY NOT SEEM OF ANY INTEREST TO MOST PEOPLE
AUD0000000931_S0000152 FOR WE STOPPED AT FEW PLACES AND ALWAYS UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH DID NOT PERMIT OF SIGHTSEEING
AUD0000000931_S0000157 BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT WAS AT THE BREAK OF DAY ON A SUNDAY AND VERY EARLY IN APRIL WHEN WE LEFT VILNA
AUD0000000931_S0000162 HALF SITTING HALF LYING ON SOME OF THE MANY BASKETS AND BOXES THAT STOOD ALL ABOUT THE ROOM ALL READY TO BE TAKEN TO THE STATION
AUD0000000931_S0000167 WE WENT OUT INTO THE STREET AND NOW I PERCEIVED THAT NOT WE ALONE WERE SLEEPY EVERYTHING SLEPT
AUD0000000931_S0000179 WHEN WE HAD SECURED OUR TICKETS AND SEEN TO THE BAGGAGE WE ENTERED A CAR IN THE WOMEN'S DIVISION AND WAITED IMPATIENTLY FOR THE TRAIN TO START
AUD0000000931_S0000184 THERE WAS A LONG TEDIOUS RIDE OF ABOUT EIGHT HOURS
AUD0000000931_S0000189 WE GOT LITTLE REST EXCEPT THE YOUNGER ONES
AUD0000000931_S0000194 MOTHER FOUND THEM VERY PLEASANT TO CHAT WITH
AUD0000000931_S0000199 THE WEATHER HAD CHANGED VERY MUCH
AUD0000000931_S0000205 WAITED UPON BY THE LIVELIEST BUSIEST WAITERS I HAD EVER SEEN
AUD0000000931_S0000211 SOON THE FIFTEEN MINUTES WERE UP
AUD0000000931_S0000227 AND NEVER HESITATED TO ASSERT HIS RIGHTS AS HOLDER OF UNLIMITED AUTHORITY OVER HIS LITTLE DOMAIN
AUD0000000931_S0000232 THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT APPROVE
AUD0000000931_S0000241 CAME IN FOLLOWED BY A THIRD GENDARME
AUD0000000931_S0000246 HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAD
AUD0000000931_S0000275 I REMEMBER
AUD0000000931_S0000285 TILL WE WENT TO SPEND THE NIGHT AT HERR SCHIDORSKY'S
AUD0000000931_S0000342 AND LITTLE WE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT
AUD0000000931_S0000348 BUT A CERTAIN AIR OF FOREIGNNESS WHICH SOMETIMES WAS VERY VAGUE
AUD0000000931_S0000355 AND RUBBED OUR EYES AND ASKED OF ONE ANOTHER WHAT WE SAW
AUD0000000931_S0000361 I'M SURE I DON'T
AUD0000000931_S0000366 HOLDING ON TO THAT SHINING THING
AUD0000000931_S0000371 AND NOT UNTIL MUCH LATER DID WE KNOW THAT THOSE WONDERFUL THINGS
AUD0000000931_S0000376 THOUGH MOST PASSED BY AS THOUGH USED TO SUCH SIGHTS
AUD0000000931_S0000381 HOURS WE THOUGHT AND STILL THE HORSES RAN
AUD0000000931_S0000386 THE CONVEYANCE NO WORD OF EXPLANATION AND ALL
AUD0000000931_S0000391 THE FACES AROUND ME CONFESSED THE SAME
AUD0000000931_S0000396 THE ROAR OF THE SEA AND THE WIND AMONG THE BRANCHES HAVE AN UNFRIENDLY SOUND
AUD0000000931_S0000401 THE DARK WAVES ROLL INWARD THE WHITE FOAM FLIES HIGH IN THE AIR DEEP SOUNDS COME FROM IT
AUD0000000931_S0000406 AND THE HOOFS AND THE WHEELS REPEAT THE COMMAND
AUD0000000931_S0000411 AND YET SO FUNNY
AUD0000000931_S0000416 WHERE ONLY THE TREES AND IN THE DISTANCE THE PASSING TRAINS CAN BE SEEN
AUD0000000931_S0000421 ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LITTLE CORRIDOR WAS A SMALL OFFICE WHERE A MAN SAT BEFORE A DESK COVERED WITH PAPERS
AUD0000000931_S0000427 THE LITTLE SUM WE STARTED WITH WAS TO LAST US TO THE END OF THE JOURNEY
AUD0000000931_S0000432 AND HAD SOLD SOME THINGS TO A WOMAN FOR LESS THAN A THIRD OF THEIR VALUE
AUD0000000931_S0000442 THAT WAS NICE TREATMENT
AUD0000000931_S0000447 AND NOW THIS OUTRAGEOUS INDIGNITY
AUD0000000931_S0000452 WHICH IT WAS NOT
AUD0000000931_S0000458 THINKING IT WORTH WHILE TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH A PLACE WHERE WE MIGHT BE OBLIGED TO STAY FOR I KNEW NOT HOW LONG
AUD0000000931_S0000463 WHEN THE DOCTOR WAS THROUGH WITH US HE TOLD US TO GO TO NUMBER FIVE
AUD0000000931_S0000468 AND ON SEEING THE SPEAKER FOUND IT TO BE AN OLD FRIEND OF OURS FROM PLOTZK
AUD0000000931_S0000475 I SAW A VERY LARGE ROOM AROUND WHOSE WALLS WERE RANGED ROWS OF HIGH IRON DOUBLE BEDSTEADS
AUD0000000931_S0000480 FROM THE CEILING HUNG TWO ROUND GAS LAMPS
AUD0000000931_S0000485 AND THE BEDS WERE SLEEPING ROOMS DINING ROOMS PARLORS AND EVERYTHING ELSE
AUD0000000931_S0000491 WHO HAD BEEN WALKING IN THE YARD RAN IN AND ANNOUNCED
AUD0000000931_S0000496 AND I WONDERED WHY THEY HURRIED SO
AUD0000000931_S0000502 PRETTY SOON A MAN APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY TALL SPARE WITH A THIN POINTED BEARD
AUD0000000931_S0000507 HE GAVE A PIECE TO EVERY PERSON THE YOUNGEST CHILD AND THE BIGGEST MAN ALIKE
AUD0000000931_S0000512 WE COULDN'T EAT THOSE THINGS AND ONLY WONDERED HOW ANY ONE COULD HAVE SUCH AN APPETITE FOR SUCH A DINNER
AUD0000000931_S0000517 THE DOORS OF THE PRISON WERE NEVER UNLOCKED EXCEPT WHEN NEW PASSENGERS ARRIVED OR OTHERS LEFT FOR THEIR SHIPS
AUD0000000931_S0000523 WITH THIS ALL WENT TO THE KITCHEN AND RECEIVED TWO LITTLE ROLLS AND A LARGE CUP OF PARTLY SWEETENED TEA
AUD0000000931_S0000541 WE WERE READY FOR IT AND ANXIOUS ENOUGH
AUD0000000931_S0000547 AND A SURE SIGN OF A HOLIDAY BOTH GAS LAMPS BURNING
AUD0000000931_S0000552 THE YOUNG MAN BLESS HIM WHO HAD THE HONOR TO PERFORM THE CEREMONIES
AUD0000000931_S0000557 ESPECIALLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE WINE FOR WHEN WE CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE TO DRINK THE WINE WE FOUND IT TASTED LIKE GOOD VINEGAR
AUD0000000931_S0000563 THEN OF THIS ONE JUST DESCRIBED
AUD0000000931_S0000574 AND WERE A LITTLE WAY FROM IT WHEN THE OLD WOMAN STOPPED SHORT AND CALLED ON THE REST TO WAIT
AUD0000000931_S0000579 CALLING FOR THE OVERSEER WHO HAD PROMISED TO SUPPLY US
AUD0000000931_S0000585 WE LOOKED AT THE OLD WOMAN
AUD0000000931_S0000590 SHE BROUGHT US MATZO
AUD0000000931_S0000596 AND WAIT TILL THE NAME OF OUR SHIP WAS CALLED
AUD0000000931_S0000601 THEN TO A LARGER STEAMER THAN THE ONE WE CAME IN
AUD0000000931_S0000610 I ONLY REMEMBER FROM THAT MOMENT THAT I HAD ONLY ONE CARE TILL ALL BECAME QUIET NOT TO LOSE HOLD OF MY SISTER'S HAND
AUD0000000931_S0000615 THERE WERE OFFICERS GIVING OUT ORDERS IN LOUD VOICES LIKE TRUMPETS
AUD0000000931_S0000620 AND THERE SEEMED TO BE EVERYTHING UNDER HEAVEN THAT HAD ANY NOISE IN IT
AUD0000000931_S0000625 WHEN THE SAILORS BROUGHT OUR THINGS WE GOT EVERYTHING IN ORDER FOR THE JOURNEY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AUD0000000931_S0000631 AND MANY PREPARATIONS MADE
AUD0000000931_S0000636 ALL THE LITTLE BOATS AND STEAMERS HAD DISAPPEARED
AUD0000000931_S0000641 BUT THEY DIDN'T SHOUT AS BEFORE
AUD0000000931_S0000646 THE AIR WAS STILL AND PLEASANT
AUD0000000931_S0000651 THE PEACE THAT ENCIRCLED EVERYTHING AROUND US
AUD0000000931_S0000656 ALL SEEMED TO DO SO ALL SPOKE IN LOW VOICES AND SEEMED TO BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING AS THEY GAZED QUIETLY INTO THE SMOOTH DEPTHS BELOW
AUD0000000931_S0000661 AND FILL THE AIR WITH WHITE CLOUDS AND LAST FAREWELLS
AUD0000000931_S0000666 FOR IT BEARS MY CHILDREN WITH IT
AUD0000000931_S0000671 I WILL OBEY MY MISTRESS
AUD0000000931_S0000676 I FELT ONLY A SENSE OF HAPPINESS
AUD0000000931_S0000681 WHEN THE LANTERN FIXED IN THE CEILING HAD BEEN LIGHTED THE CAPTAIN AND THE STEWARD PAID US A VISIT
AUD0000000931_S0000686 THEN ALL WENT TO BED THOUGH IT WAS VERY EARLY
AUD0000000931_S0000691 OH HOW WRETCHED IT MADE US
AUD0000000931_S0000696 THERE IS NOBODY TO COMFORT THEM ALL ARE SO MISERABLE
AUD0000000931_S0000703 SO I CRAWLED BACK AS WELL AS I COULD AND NOBODY ELSE TRIED TO GO OUT
AUD0000000931_S0000708 GIVING THEM CARDS TO GET IT WITH
AUD0000000931_S0000713 AT TWELVE A SAILOR ANNOUNCED THAT DINNER WAS READY
AUD0000000931_S0000719 ALTHOUGH WE LIVED ON WATER ALONE FOR A WEEK
AUD0000000931_S0000724 THE SHIP WAS QUIETER AND EVERYTHING SADDER THAN BY DAYLIGHT
AUD0000000931_S0000729 THAT I MIGHT BE MADE WELL BY SPEAKING TO THEM
AUD0000000931_S0000735 THE SHIP WAS TOSSED ABOUT MORE THAN THE DAY BEFORE
AUD0000000931_S0000740 A LITTLE BAND WAS PLAYING AND A FEW YOUNG SAILORS AND GERMAN GIRLS TRIED EVEN TO DANCE BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
AUD0000000931_S0000745 ITS WAVES GIVING OUT DEEP ANGRY TONES
AUD0000000931_S0000750 AND ANGER AND DISTANCE
AUD0000000931_S0000755 SO WE GO TO SLEEP
AUD0000000931_S0000760 ON THE EIGHTH DAY OUT WE ARE AGAIN ABLE TO BE ABOUT
AUD0000000931_S0000765 AND THE SAILORS AND GIRLS HAD A GOOD MANY DANCES
AUD0000000931_S0000770 OH WHAT SOLEMN THOUGHTS I HAD
AUD0000000931_S0000775 KNOCKING AGAINST EACH OTHER IN FURY AND SEETHING AND FOAMING IN THEIR ANGER THE GREY SKY WITH ITS MOUNTAINS OF GLOOMY CLOUDS FLYING MOVING WITH THE WAVES
AUD0000000931_S0000780 AND STIRRING AND WARMING
AUD0000000931_S0000785 AND KNEW I HAD NEVER BEFORE HAD SUCH A CLEAR IDEA OF THEM
AUD0000000931_S0000790 WHAT I DID AT SUCH TIMES I DO NOT KNOW I MUST HAVE BEEN DAZED
AUD0000000931_S0000795 I WAS AWARE OF NO HUMAN PRESENCE I WAS CONSCIOUS ONLY OF SEA AND SKY AND SOMETHING I DID NOT UNDERSTAND
AUD0000000931_S0000800 THE OCEAN SPOKE TO ME IN OTHER BESIDES MOURNFUL OR ANGRY TONES
AUD0000000931_S0000805 BUT I HEARD AND FELT IT
AUD0000000931_S0000810 LEADING A QUIET LIFE THE SAME EVERY DAY
AUD0000000931_S0000816 WHICH DISAPPEARED AS THOUGH FRIGHTENED AND WHEN THE SEA LOOKED MORE FRIENDLY
AUD0000000931_S0000821 HOW SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT WE FELT AT THE SIGHT
AUD0000000931_S0000826 WE USED TO WATCH FOR THEM AND OFTEN MISTOOK THE CLOUDS FOR BIRDS
AUD0000000931_S0000831 I THOUGHT MY THOUGHTS EACH DAY AS I WATCHED THE SCENE
AUD0000000931_S0000836 YET WHEN ON THE TWELFTH DAY AFTER LEAVING HAMBURG
AUD0000000931_S0000841 TO BE THE FIRST ONES TO SEE THE SHORES OF AMERICA
AUD0000000931_S0000846 AND WE COULD JUST SEE FROM ONE END OF THE DECK TO THE OTHER
AUD0000000931_S0000851 IN THE MORNING IT WAS STILL FOGGY
AUD0000000931_S0000856 AT LAST IT WAS NIGHT ONCE MORE AND WE IN OUR BERTHS BUT NOBODY SLEPT
AUD0000000931_S0000861 DISHES WERE BROKEN INTO LITTLE BITS THAT FLEW ABOUT FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER
AUD0000000931_S0000866 WHEN IT TOSSED ON THE OTHER SIDE WE COULD SEE THE LITTLE WINDOWS ALMOST TOUCH THE WATER
AUD0000000931_S0000872 AND OH HOW SAD IT SOUNDED
AUD0000000931_S0000877 THIS FRIGHTENED US MORE THAN EVER
AUD0000000931_S0000882 ANOTHER NIGHT PASSED AND THE DAY THAT FOLLOWED WAS PRETTY FAIR AND TOWARDS EVENING THE SKY WAS ALMOST CLOUDLESS
AUD0000000931_S0000887 WE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT
AUD0000000931_S0000892 AFTER SEEING AND HEARING NOTHING BUT THE SKY AND THE SEA AND ITS ROARING
AUD0000000931_S0000897 SOMEONE QUESTIONED THE CAPTAIN
AUD0000000931_S0000902 AND THEN WENT ON DECK TO WATCH FOR LAND
AUD0000000931_S0000907 AND AS WE TALKED OF THE STRANGE DELAY
AUD0000000931_S0000912 YOU CAN IMAGINE OUR FEELINGS AT THIS
AUD0000000931_S0000917 IT WAS THE EIGHTH OF MAY THE SEVENTEENTH DAY AFTER WE LEFT HAMBURG
AUD0000000931_S0000923 AND IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO LIVE MERELY TO HEAR THEIR SONGS
AUD0000000931_S0000928 AND THIS WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE JOYS OF THE DAY
AUD0000000931_S0000934 SUCH EXCITEMENT SUCH JOY
AUD0000000931_S0000939 NO CORNER OF THE EARTH IS HALF SO FAIR AS THE LOVELY PICTURE BEFORE US
AUD0000000931_S0000944 AND ARE SO DEAR TO OUR EYES THAT WE DARE NOT SPEAK A WORD NOW
AUD0000000931_S0000949 THE SUN WARMER THE SEA IS TOO QUIET FOR ITS NAME
AUD0000000931_S0000954 HOW COMPLETE
AUD0000000931_S0000959 WHEN A NUMBER OF MEN CAME ON BOARD FROM A LITTLE STEAMER
AUD0000001030_S0000052 HE HATES COR DIALLY IN THE TRUE PAGAN FASHION OF OLD HE IS FULL OF PREJUDICES AND HAS SOME IDEAS WHICH ALMOST AMOUNT TO SUPERSTITIONS AND THOUGH HE FEARS NOTHING
AUD0000001030_S0000060 IF THE VALET SEES THE HERO OR THE STATESMAN TOO CLOSELY SO SOMETIMES DOES THE GAMEKEEPER
AUD0000001030_S0000074 FROM THE SPORTSMEN
AUD0000001030_S0000085 AND THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF LIQUOR AND SILVER GOING ABOUT
AUD0000001030_S0000090 BESIDES WHICH BEING SWIFT OF FOOT AND WITH A SHREWD IDEA WHICH WAY THE FOX WILL RUN WHEN THE HUNT IS UP
AUD0000001030_S0000101 SO MUCH SO THAT THE CHARACTER OF THE COTTAGER MAY ALMOST BE GUESSED FROM A GLANCE AT HER GLASS
AUD0000001030_S0000108 SHE EXPLAINS THAT THIS RUG COMES WITHIN HER SPECIAL SPHERE IT IS A CARRIAGE RUG OF CAT-SKIN THE SKINS CAREFULLY SELECTED TO MATCH EXACTLY AND CURED AND PREPARED IN THE SAME WAY AS OTHER MORE FAMOUS FURS
AUD0000001030_S0000117 THIS GIVES AN IDEA OF THE EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF CATS WHICH STRAY ABROAD AND GET THEIR LIVING BY POACHING
AUD0000001030_S0000122 THE CAT IS DRIVEN AWAY BY THE NEW COMER AND TAKES TO THE FIELD
AUD0000001030_S0000131 THE FUR IS USED TO LINE CLOAKS
AUD0000001030_S0000138 THIS SOUNDS A DELI CATE MATTER AND DANGEROUSLY NEAR THE DEADLY SIN OF VULPECIDE
AUD0000001030_S0000145 THE TEETH MAKE STUDS SET IN GOLD AND NO PART OF REYNARD IS THROWN AWAY
AUD0000001030_S0000151 AND THE WORK IS A YEAR OR MORE ABOUT THERE IS THEN THE SEWING TOGETHER
AUD0000001030_S0000160 NEITHER STOATS' NOR WEASELS' SKINS ARE PRESERVED EXCEPT NOW AND THEN FOR STUFFING TO PUT UNDER A GLASS CASE
AUD0000001030_S0000165 WHICH AGAIN IS BORDERED BY WATER-MEADOWS
AUD0000001030_S0000175 THE KEEPER'S WIFE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RABBITS
AUD0000001030_S0000187 BUT THESE LARGE ONES ARE FROM A TREE WHICH BEARS A FINE NUT HER HUSBAND HAS THEM SAVED EVERY YEAR
AUD0000001030_S0000197 WHOSE PARENTS LOCK THEIR COTTAGE DOORS WHEN LEAVING FOR WORK IN THE MORN ING SO THAT THEIR OFFSPRING SHALL NOT GAIN ENTRANCE AND GET INTO MISCHIEF
AUD0000001030_S0000205 AFTER SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN
AUD0000001030_S0000214 FROM THIS IT WAS BUT A SHORT STEP TO BE TRUSTED WITH THE SINGLE BARREL
AUD0000001030_S0000220 WHERE EVEN A GOOD SHOT MAY MISS REPEATEDLY
AUD0000001030_S0000226 OR THE BRANCHES GET IN THE WAY
AUD0000001030_S0000232 RABBIT-SHOOTING ALSO IN AN ASH WOOD LIKE THIS IS TRYING TO THE TEMPER THEY DOUBLE AND DODGE AND IF YOU WAIT THINKING THAT THE BROWN RASCALS MUST PRESENTLY CROSS THE PARTIALLY OPEN SPACE YONDER
AUD0000001030_S0000238 THE LAD IF YOU ASK HIM
AUD0000001030_S0000244 HE IS MORE BITTER THAN HIS FATHER AGAINST POACHERS
AUD0000001030_S0000251 AND THUS THEY CAN EASILY CAST EARTH OVER AND CONCEAL THE ENTRANCE TO A HOLE
AUD0000001030_S0000262 SOME WHO ARE NOT CHILDREN OR ARE CHILDREN OF A LARGER GROWTH LIKE TO HAVE A TAME HAWK IN THE GARDEN
AUD0000001030_S0000271 THE KEEPER'S BOY SELLS TOO YOUNG SQUIRRELS FROM TIME TO TIME
AUD0000001030_S0000277 OR SLUNG ON A STICK OR THE GUN-BARREL ACROSS THE SHOULDER
AUD0000001030_S0000288 MEN MOVE ABOUT FROM PLACE TO PLACE
AUD0000001030_S0000297 AND SUPERINTEND THE MIXING OF THEIR FOOD HIS TREMBLING HAND UPON THE BACK OF WHICH THE CORDED SINEWS ARE SO STRONGLY MARKED NOW THE TISSUE HAS WASTED
AUD0000001030_S0000303 FALL TO BRISKLY WHEN THEY SEE HIM COMING WITH BESOM AND RUSTY KNIFE WHEREWITH TO UCK OUT THE SPRINGING GRASS
AUD0000001030_S0000333 AFTER SPENDING SO MANY YEARS OF HIS LIFE AMONG TREES
AUD0000001030_S0000340 A FIRMER SUPPORT COULD NOT BE FOUND BUT AS THE TREE SWELLS WITH THE RISING SAP AND EXPANDS YEAR BY YEAR THE IRON GIRDLE CIRCLING ABOUT IT DOES NOT GIVE OR YIELD TO THIS SLOW MOTION
AUD0000001030_S0000348 THOUGH NOT TO SUCH AN EXTENT ROUGH AND STRONG AS THE BARK SEEMS TO THE TOUCH IT SPEEDILY ABRADES UNDER THE CON STANT PRESSURE OF THE METAL
AUD0000001030_S0000360 SOON HOWEVER
AUD0000001030_S0000365 NOW IN THE FOREST OR THE WOODLANDS AWAY FROM THE PARK OR PLEASURE-GROUNDS
AUD0000001030_S0000371 AND EXAMINING THE TREES WITH CRITICAL EYE
AUD0000001030_S0000378 WHERE MORE FUNGUS IS FLOURISHING
AUD0000001030_S0000383 THE TREE SNAPS CLEAN OFF TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND
AUD0000001030_S0000389 OR OVER A BROOK LYING AT A LOWER LEVEL
AUD0000001030_S0000396 NO CARE IS TAKEN TO PLANT FRESH SAPLINGS
AUD0000001030_S0000401 THE HOOFS OF THE IRON HORSE MAY TRAMPLE THEM DOWN AS FRESH POPULATIONS GROW
AUD0000001030_S0000409 WAS REWARDED WITH A BROAD TRACT OF LAND WHICH HE WAS TO HOLD FOR THREE CROPS
AUD0000001030_S0000417 AND EVERYWHERE THE PARK AND DOMAIN OF THE FEUDAL LORDS
AUD0000001030_S0000428 WHEN ITS LOAD OF HONEY IS COMPLETED
AUD0000001030_S0000435 IT IS DIFFICULT TO DECIDE AT WHAT TIME OF THE YEAR THE PARK IS IN ITS GLORY
AUD0000001030_S0000441 A FLOWERING TREE I FANCY LOOKS BEST WHEN APART AND NOT ONE OF A ROW
AUD0000001030_S0000449 IS SOMEWHAT SUPERSTITIOUS
AUD0000001030_S0000456 SINCE THEN THE KEEPER AVOIDS THE SPOT NOR WILL HE HARDY AS HE IS GO NEAR IT AT NIGHT NOT EVEN IN THE SUMMER MOONLIGHT WHEN THE NIGHT IS MERELY A PROLONGATION OF THE DAY
AUD0000001030_S0000484 SOME CREDIT THE FOX WITH A FONDNESS FOR THE SAME FOOD AND EVEN THE HORNET'S NEST IS SAID TO BE SIMILARLY RAVAGED
AUD0000001030_S0000493 ALMOST ON THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND
AUD0000001030_S0000498 IN THE MEADOWS LOWER DOWN
AUD0000001030_S0000504 SOME DOGS WILL NOT TOUCH SNAKES OTHERS SEEM TO ENJOY DES TROYING THEM BUT IT IS NOTICEABLE THAT A DOG WHICH PREVIOUSLY HAS PASSED OR AVOIDED SNAKES IF ONCE HE KILLS ONE
AUD0000001030_S0000510 AND THE RICK IS OF COURSE TOO LARGE FOR THE SNAKE TO ENCIRCLE IT
AUD0000001030_S0000519 SO LOUD AND THREATENING IS THE HISSING NOISE MADE BY THE BROOD
AUD0000001030_S0000527 AS THE BOUGH DECAYS THE BARK LOOSENS AND IS INVADED BY INSECTS WHICH WHEN IT WAS GREEN COULD NOT TOUCH IT
AUD0000001030_S0000541 THIS IS THE SECRET OF OBSERVATION STILLNESS SILENCE AND APPARENT INDIFFERENCE
AUD0000001030_S0000550 KEEP YOUR GLANCE ON A FROND OF THE FERN JUST BEYOND HIM
AUD0000001030_S0000555 LET THE WAYFARER PASS BENEATH THE BOUGH ON WHICH THEY ARE SINGING AND THEY WILL SING ON IF HE MOVES WITHOUT APPARENT INTEREST SHOULD HE PAUSE TO LISTEN THEIR WINGS GLISTEN IN THE SUN AS THEY FLY
AUD0000001030_S0000564 COUNTRY PEOPLE WILL HAVE IT THAT CUCKOOS ARE GROWING SCARCER EVERY YEAR
AUD0000001030_S0000576 IN THE DEPTHS OF THAT POOL THERE WERE FORMERLY PLENTY OF FISH WITH DEEP DARK SPOTS IN WHICH TO HIDE
AUD0000001030_S0000586 IT IS BETTER SO NO DOUBT IN A PURELY UTILITARIAN SENSE BUT THE FISH HAUNT THE SPOT NO MORE
AUD0000001030_S0000597 THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT THE FISH WHICH GO DOWN THE STREAM AND ENTER THE CANAL ARE SPEEDILY DESTROYED
AUD0000001030_S0000606 THE TWO COME TO A BROAD DEEP BROOK
AUD0000001030_S0000611 SHAKES HIS HEAD
AUD0000001030_S0000620 AS YOU WAVE YOUR HAND IN TOKEN OF FAREWELL
AUD0000001030_S0000632 HE WALKS HASTILY TWENTY YARDS UP THE BROOK
AUD0000001030_S0000642 CHECKS IT
AUD0000001030_S0000650 WOULD INFALLIBLE INSTINCT HESITATE
AUD0000001030_S0000657 THERE IS AT LEAST A SINGULAR COINCIDENCE IN THE OUTWARD ACTIONS OF THE TWO
AUD0000001030_S0000667 ADMIT THE ANIMAL WORLD TO A SHARE IN THE FACULTY OF REASON
AUD0000001030_S0000675 EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY EDUCATES THE DOG AS IT DOES THE MAN
AUD0000001030_S0000683 SHE WAS WEAKLY WHEN YOUNG AND FOR THAT REASON TOGETHER WITH OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WAS NEVER PROPERLY TRAINED A FACT THAT MAY PERHAPS HAVE PREVENTED HER MIND FROM CONGEALING INTO THE STOLIDITY OF ROUTINE
AUD0000001030_S0000693 AND IN THAT POSITION GROPED ABOUT ON THE BOTTOM TILL A FISH CAME IN CONTACT WITH HER MOUTH AND WAS INSTANTLY SNATCHED OUT
AUD0000001030_S0000698 BUT AFTER A TIME HE TOO WAS CAPTURED
AUD0000001030_S0000706 IT WAS AN ORIGINAL MOTION OF HER OWN TO WHAT CAN IT BE COMPARED BUT MIND PROCEEDING BY EXPERI MENT
AUD0000001030_S0000717 A RACE LIKE THIS OVER THE ELASTIC TURF OF THE DOWNS INHALING WITH EXPANDED LUNGS AIR WHICH ACTS ON THE BLOOD AS STRONG DRINK ON THE BRAIN STIMULATING THE PULSE AND STRENGTHENING EVERY FIBRE OF THE FRAME IS EQUAL TO ANOTHER YEAR OF LIFE
AUD0000001030_S0000726 SHOOTING GENERALLY COMMENCES WITH PICKING OUT THE YOUNG RABBITS ABOUT THE MIDDLE OR TOWARDS THE END OF THE HAY HARVEST
AUD0000001030_S0000733 THE EYE IS ALSO GUIDED BY THE GRASS ITSELF AND THE ELEVATION OF THE RABBIT'S HEAD ABOVE IT WHEN LIFTED IN ALARM AT A CHANCE SOUND IF THE ANIMAL IS FULL GROWN OF COURSE THE HEAD STANDS HIGHER
AUD0000001030_S0000743 NEXT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK
AUD0000001030_S0000751 THE RABBIT PRESENTLY TURNS HIS BACK TOWARDS YOU SNIFFING ABOUT FOR THE TENDEREST BLADES THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY
AUD0000001030_S0000757 AND THE MOMENT HE TURNS HIS BACK TOWARDS YOU UP GOES THE GUN NOT BEFORE
AUD0000001030_S0000763 SO THAT IT IS MUCH BETTER TO STEADILY POT HIM
AUD0000001030_S0000775 SHOT HOLES THROUGH THE EARS ARE FREQUENTLY SEEN
AUD0000001030_S0000781 AND HE PASSED BETWEEN MY LEGS
AUD0000001030_S0000786 I ONCE WHILE LOOKING FOR SNIPE WITH CHARGES OF SMALL SHOT IN THE BARRELS ROUSED A FINE HARE AND FIRED WITHOUT APPARENT EFFECT
AUD0000001030_S0000800 A MOLE EMERGES
AUD0000001030_S0000805 OR SO GLOSSY A FUR WOULD PROVE HIS RUIN
AUD0000001030_S0000811 RAMIFYING LIKE THE ROADS WHICH LEAD FROM A CITY
AUD0000001030_S0000819 THIS RENDERS IT DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE THEM
AUD0000001030_S0000825 ONCE ON A HAWTHORN BRANCH IN A HEDGE I SAW A MOUSE DESCENDING WITH AN ACORN HE WAS PERHAPS FIVE FEET FROM THE GROUND
AUD0000001030_S0000833 THEY ARE FOUND TO BE ANIMATED BY SOME MOTIVE POWER
AUD0000001030_S0000841 THE MICE RUSH TO THEIR HOLES THE WEASEL DARTS BACK INTO THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH A RABBIT THAT HAS QUIETLY SLIPPED OUT UNSEEN INTO THE GRASS BOUNDS WITH EAGER HASTE TO COVER
AUD0000001030_S0000847 WHICH AT THE EXTREMITIES HAVE A TINGE OF RED INVISIBLE AT A DISTANCE TILL THE SUNBEAMS ILLUMINATE THE TREES
AUD0000001030_S0000853 DROPPING SUDDENLY FROM THEIR ROOSTING-PLACE ON THE HIGHEST BOUGHS OF THE GREAT BEECH-TREES
AUD0000001030_S0000858 WOOD-PIGEONS HAVE APPARENTLY MUCH INCREASED IN NUMBERS OF RECENT YEARS THEY FREQUENT SHELTERED SPOTS WHERE THE BUSHES DIMINISH THE SEVERITY OF THE FROST
AUD0000001030_S0000864 UPON INVESTIGATION THE REAL NUMBER IS FOUND TO BE SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN
AUD0000001030_S0000870 IT REQUIRES A GUN ON EACH SIDE OF THE HEDGE
AUD0000001030_S0000897 FOR THE MAGPIE OF RECENT YEARS HAS BECOME MUCH LESS COMMON
AUD0000001030_S0000904 HARDLY HAS HE LEFT THE GATEWAY BEFORE A LEGION OF SMALL BIRDS POURS OUT FROM THE HEDGEROWS AND SEEKS FOR THE STRAY SEEDS
AUD0000001030_S0000915 NOW AND THEN SOME ONE ARGUES WITH THE KEEPER
AUD0000001030_S0000921 AND NAILED TO THE SIDE OF THE SHED
AUD0000001030_S0000932 RABBITS TOUCHED BY THE DREAD PARASITE THAT CAUSES THE FATAL ROT THE YOUNG PHEASANT STRAYING FROM THE COOP
AUD0000001030_S0000943 AND WHERE NO KEEPER GOES HIS ROUNDS
AUD0000001030_S0000950 MAY LIE HIDDEN IN TANGLED MASSES OF FERN AND BRAMBLE WHILE THE KEEPER PASSES NOT TEN YARDS AWAY
AUD0000001030_S0000958 THE KEEPER IS OF OPINION THAT THE SOMEWHAT STIFF AND TRIM PLANTATIONS ARE PREFERABLE
AUD0000001030_S0000966 THIS MASS OF NEEDLES TAKES YEARS TO ALL APPEARANCE TO DECAY
AUD0000001030_S0000977 THOSE THEY GATHER THEY SELL OF COURSE AND ALTHOUGH THE PURSUIT MAY BE PERFECTLY HARMLESS IN ITSELF HOW IS THE KEEPER TO BE CERTAIN THAT IF OPPORTUNITY OFFERED THESE GENTRY WOULD NOT POUNCE UPON A RABBIT OR ANYTHING ELSE
AUD0000001030_S0000985 OCCASIONALLY MEN COME TO SEARCH FOR WALKING STICKS FOR WHICH THERE IS NOW A REGULAR TRADE
AUD0000001030_S0000992 ANOTHER KIND OF ASH STICK WHICH IS IN DEMAND IS ONE ROUND WHICH THERE RUNS A SPIRAL GROOVE
AUD0000001030_S0000998 WILD HOPS ARE COMMON IN MANY PLACES
AUD0000001030_S0001004 NEITHER BLACKTHORN NOR CRABTREE SEEM SO POPULAR AS THEY ONCE WERE FOR THIS PURPOSE
AUD0000001030_S0001010 AND WHERE THE DISORDERLY HOP-PICKERS ARE GREAT THIEVES
AUD0000001030_S0001019 IT IS CERTAIN THAT ONLY BY CONSTANT WATCHFULNESS CAN DOWNRIGHT DESTRUCTION BE PREVENTED
AUD0000001030_S0001025 SO OPPOSED TO THE ORDINARY CURRENT OF IDEAS AS TO BE CERTAIN OF ATTRACTING THE PASSER-BY
AUD0000001030_S0001031 TO LIGHT A FIRE SEEMS ONE OF THE SPECIAL DELIGHTS OF THESE LADS AND SOMETIMES OF MEN WHO SHOULD HAVE LEARNED BETTER AND TO LIGHT IT IN A HOLLOW TREE IS THE HIGHEST FLIGHT OF GENIUS
AUD0000001030_S0001037 WHERE AT THE POINTED ROOF ONE THIN STREAK OF DAYLIGHT PENETRATES
AUD0000001030_S0001043 NOW AND THEN THERE IS SUFFICIENT SAP YET REMAINING IN THE BARK AND OUTER RING OF WOOD TO CHECK THE FIRE WHEN IT REACHES IT AND FINALLY IT DIES OUT
AUD0000001030_S0001049 GRAVER MISCHIEF IS SOMETIMES COMMITTED WITH THE LUCIFER MATCH
AUD0000001030_S0001056 NOW NOTHING FLARES UP WITH SUCH A SUDDEN FIERCENESS AS FURZE
AUD0000001030_S0001064 STOATS BADGERS WILD CATS
AUD0000001030_S0001069 AND IN AN INSTANT ALL HAVE PERISHED
AUD0000001030_S0001077 YET ANIMAL LIFE IS NOT SO QUICKLY RE PAIRED
AUD0000001030_S0001088 THE RAIDERS COMING IN GANGS FROM A DISTANCE
AUD0000001030_S0001094 THEY THEREFORE DESERVE FIRST CONSIDERATION
AUD0000001030_S0001111 ARE PECULIARLY FAVOUR ABLE TO ILLICIT SPORT
AUD0000001030_S0001120 AND IN THE MORNING SHOULD ANY ONE PASS HIS LEAPS AND BOUNDS AND ROLLS WILL OF COURSE BE SEEN
AUD0000001030_S0001126 IT IS MEASURED BY PLACING THE CLENCHED FIST ON THE EARTH
AUD0000001030_S0001135 THE POACHER REVISITS HIS SNARES VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING
AUD0000001030_S0001141 THE PROFESSIONAL POACHER NEVER LEAVES HIS WIRES SET UP ALL DAY
AUD0000001030_S0001148 BUT THE FERRET IS THE POACHER'S CHIEF ASSISTANT IN RABBITING IT TAKES TWO MEN
AUD0000001030_S0001157 IF A MAN COMES ALONG AT AN EXCEPTIONALLY EARLY HOUR WITH COAT POCKETS VIOLENTLY BULGING
AUD0000001030_S0001164 FINDING A MAN WHOM HE KNOWS TO BE USUALLY SOBER OVERTAKEN WITH DRINK IN A LONELY ROAD WHERE HE INJURES NONE BUT HIMSELF
AUD0000001030_S0001171 THE LONDON DEALER WHO RECEIVES LARGE CONSIGNMENTS AT ONCE HAS OF COURSE NO MEANS OF DISTINGUISHING POACHED FROM OTHER GAME
AUD0000001030_S0001177 AND TO PREFER PUR CHASERS FROM A DISTANCE WHO MUST TAKE SOME TIME TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE DISTRICT POACHERS
AUD0000001030_S0001186 BUT IT IS ONLY FOR THEIR OWN EATING AND IS NOT OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE IN COMPARISON WITH THE WORK OF THE REAL LOCAL PROFESSIONAL
AUD0000001030_S0001195 BUT INSENSIBLY CHANGES HIS COURSE AND QUIETLY APPROACHES SIDELONG THEN
AUD0000001030_S0001201 THERE IS SOMETHING OF THE HANGMAN'S KNACK IN THIS
AUD0000001030_S0001208 WHILE THE REAL ENEMY COMES UP UNAWARES
AUD0000001030_S0001215 THE MANOEUVRE HOWEVER FREQUENTLY FAILS
AUD0000001030_S0001221 I HAVE KNOWN A COUPLE OF MEN TAKE A PONY AND TRAP FOR THIS SPECIAL PURPOSE
AUD0000001030_S0001228 THEY DRAW UP BY A GATEWAY AND ONE OF THEM DISMOUNTS
AUD0000001030_S0001250 SLOWLY WANDERING LIKE THIS
AUD0000001030_S0001257 HE IS AWARE THAT THEY HAVE NO NECESSITY TO VISIT HEDGEROWS AND MOUNDS A HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT
AUD0000001030_S0001268 HALF OF WHICH ARE OF VERY LITTLE USE BUT CANNOT BE CLOSED
AUD0000001030_S0001276 NEITHER IS IT OF ANY USE TO SEARCH A MAN WHOSE TOOLS TO A MORAL CERTAINTY ARE CONCEALED IN SOME HEDGE
AUD0000001030_S0001283 THE LURCHER SLINKS ALONG CLOSE BEHIND
AUD0000001030_S0001290 IF A MAN HAD TO GET HIS LIVING BY THE CHASE IN RED INDIAN FASHION
AUD0000001030_S0001297 BUT HE WORKS YET HARDER THAN ON WEEK-DAYS
AUD0000001030_S0001305 THIS NIGHTWORK IS VERY TRYING AFTER HIS LONG WALKS BY DAY
AUD0000001030_S0001312 UNDER PRETENCE OF CUTTING SKEWER-WOOD OFTEN CALLED DOG WOOD WHICH THEY SPLIT AND SHARPEN FOR THE BUTCHERS THEY WANDER ACROSS THE OPEN DOWNS WHERE IT GROWS
AUD0000001030_S0001318 AN INNOCENT-LOOKING BASKET OR SMALL SACK-BAG OF MUSHROOMS HAS BEFORE NOW WHEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
AUD0000001030_S0001325 HIGHER WAGES HAVE NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE DIMIN ISHED POACHING
AUD0000001030_S0001334 AND NOW AND THEN HE TAKES A WALK UP AND DOWN THE NARROW PATHS BETWEEN THE PLOTS
AUD0000001030_S0001340 AND HARES LINGER IN THEM
AUD0000001030_S0001346 INSTEAD OF DRIVING THEM OFF ARE ANXIOUS THAT THEY SHOULD COME SNIFFING AND LIMPING OVER THE PLOTS IN THE GLOAMING
AUD0000001030_S0001352 IF ANY A COUPLE OF RABBITS WOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE MAN WHO CARRIED THE COMPLAINT
AUD0000001030_S0001360 AND LETS HIS DOGS RUN ABOUT FOR THEIR NOSES ARE MUCH MORE CLEVER AT DISCOVERING HIDDEN FUR OR FEATHERS THAN HIS EYES IN WINTER IF THE WEATHER BE SEVERE HARES AND RABBITS ARE VERY BOLD AND WILL ENTER GARDENS THOUGH ATTACHED TO DWELLING-HOUSES
AUD0000001030_S0001368 POTATOES ARE A CROP WHICH FLOURISH IN FRESH-TURNED SOIL
AUD0000001030_S0001375 GENERALLY CURS IT IS TRUE
AUD0000001030_S0001382 IF A DOG COMMENCES TO HUNT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE CAN ONLY BE BROKEN OF THE HABIT BY THE UTMOST SEVERITY AND SO IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT OTHER DOGS BESIDES THOSE OF THE COTTAGERS COME TO AN UNTIMELY END BY SHOT AND GIN
AUD0000001030_S0001391 WHERE THE ANGLE MADE BY MEETING HEDGES PROTECTS THEM FROM THE WIND
AUD0000001030_S0001399 THEN THERE IS AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF FERRETING TO BE DONE
AUD0000001030_S0001407 THE STREAMS ARE NO MORE SACRED FROM MARAUDERS THAN THE WOODS AND PRESERVES
AUD0000001030_S0001413 GO IN PAIRS AND SOMETIMES IN TRIOS AND ARE MORE TAME THAN USUAL
AUD0000001030_S0001421 ELSE IT MAY TOUCH AND DISTURB THE JACK
AUD0000001030_S0001429 THE POACHER HAVING MARKED HIS PREY IN THE SHALLOW YONDER GENTLY EXTENDS HIS ROD SLOWLY ACROSS THE WATER THREE OR FOUR YARDS HIGHER UP THE STREAM
AUD0000001030_S0001436 PAST THE LONG VICIOUS JAWS AND GILLS
AUD0000001030_S0001443 IF THE OPERATION IS PERFORMED GENTLY THE JACK WILL REMAIN QUITE STILL THOUGH THE WIRE RUBS AGAINST HIS SIDE SILENCE AND STILLNESS HAVE SUCH A POWER OVER ALL LIVING CREATURES
AUD0000001030_S0001450 IT THEN GAROTTES THE FISH
AUD0000001030_S0001456 THE WIRE CAN BE CARRIED IN THE POCKET
AUD0000001030_S0001465 THE WIRE DOES A GOOD DEAL TO DEPOPULATE THE STREAM
AUD0000001030_S0001476 WITH A WIRE THERE IS LITTLE RISK OF THAT BUT THEN THE WITHY DOES NOT CUT ITS WAY INTO THE FISH
AUD0000001030_S0001482 BEING SO SHORT FOR POACHING FISH IT HAS TO BE FASTENED TO A THICKER AND LONGER STICK WHICH IS EASILY DONE AND SOME PREFER IT TO WIRE BECAUSE IT LOOKS MORE NATURAL IN THE WATER AND DOES NOT ALARM THE FISH
AUD0000001030_S0001492 AND THE MAN WAS BUT A FEW MINUTES IN ACCOMPLISHING THE FEAT
AUD0000001030_S0001501 THEY EXPOSE THEMSELVES IN OPEN PLACES
AUD0000001030_S0001506 EVERY ONE HAS HEARD OF TICKLING TROUT THE TENCH IS ALMOST EQUALLY AMENABLE TO TITILLATION
AUD0000001030_S0001513 HE THEN PASSES HIS FINGERS UNDER THE BELLY AND GENTLY RUBS IT
AUD0000001030_S0001519 AND THUS ENABLES THE HAND TO GET INTO PROPER POSITION FOR THE FINAL SEIZURE
AUD0000001030_S0001531 WITH A LONG POLE HE THRASHES THE WATER MAKING A GOOD DEAL OF SPLASH AND ROUSING UP THE MUD WHICH FISH DISLIKE AND AVOID
AUD0000001030_S0001537 IN ITS DOWNWARD COURSE THE BROOK IRRIGATES MANY WATER MEADOWS AND TO DRIVE THE STREAM OUT UPON THEM THERE ARE GREAT WOODEN HATCHES
AUD0000001030_S0001543 IN THE MAKING OF THESE DAMS SPEED IS AN OBJECT OR THE WATER WILL ACCUMULATE AND FLOW OVER THE HATCH SO HURDLES ARE USED AS THEY AFFORD A SUPPORT TO THE MUD HASTILY THROWN UP
AUD0000001030_S0001551 AND SUCH LINES MAY BE OVERLOOKED
AUD0000001030_S0001564 THE FOLLOWING CASE WHICH OCCURRED SOME YEARS SINCE
AUD0000001030_S0001572 ONE BRILLIANT MOONLIGHT NIGHT FROSTY AND CLEAR THE GANG CAME AGAIN
AUD0000001030_S0001581 WITH A SHOUT THE FOUR OR FIVE MEN IN THE DRIVE OR GREEN LANE SLIPPED BACK BEHIND THE TREES AND TWO FIRED
AUD0000001030_S0001592 BUT SEEMED TO SEPARATE AND GET OFF BY VARIOUS PATHS
AUD0000001030_S0001597 WHICH PROVED THAT ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN WOUNDED AT THE FIRST DISCHARGE
AUD0000001030_S0001605 BREECH-LOADING GUNS HAVE RENDERED SUCH AFFRAYS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ON ACCOUNT OF THE RAPIDITY OF FIRE
AUD0000001030_S0001615 WHY
AUD0000001030_S0001625 A BIT OF ASH IS THE BEST PHYSIC FOR POACHING AS I KNOWS ON
AUD0000001030_S0001634 OR POINTING THEM IN JOKE THAN EVER OCCUR IN THE FIELD
AUD0000001030_S0001642 BUT MEN WHO HAVE A GUN ALWAYS IN THEIR HANDS RARELY MEET WITH A MISHAP
AUD0000001030_S0001650 SMITHS SEEM TO HAVE A PARTICULAR FONDNESS FOR MED DLING WITH GUNS AND GENERALLY HAVE ONE STOWED AWAY SOMEWHERE
AUD0000001030_S0001659 AND AS IT IS DETACHED FROM THE HORN OR FLASK THERE IS NO DANGER OF FIRE BEING COMMUNICATED TO THE MAGAZINE SO THAT AN EXPLOSION IF IT HAPPENED
AUD0000001030_S0001666 WHEN A GUN GETS FOUL THE RAMROD IS APT TO STICK TIGHT IF PAPER IS USED AFTER PUSHING IT HOME
AUD0000001030_S0001671 THE REASON OF COURSE BEING THAT TWO CHARGES CANNOT BE INADVERTENTLY INSERTED ONE ABOVE THE OTHER
AUD0000001030_S0001677 TONE PITCH VARIATION THERE WAS NONE
AUD0000001030_S0001683 THIS GUN BELONGED TO ANOTHER PERSON AND WAS CAUGHT UP ALREADY LOADED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A FAVOURABLE CHANCE IT IS NOTICEABLE THAT HALF THE ACCIDENTS HAPPEN WITH A STRANGE GUN
AUD0000001030_S0001693 IT IS STILL SERVICEABLE HAVING BEEN KEPT DRY AND THE OWNER WILL TELL YOU THAT HE HAS BROUGHT DOWN PIGEONS WITH IT AT SEVENTY YARDS
AUD0000001030_S0001701 BUT THEY DO NOT ALIGHT AND IN SOME YEARS ARE NOT OBSERVED AT ALL
AUD0000001030_S0001706 THESE LATTER PRACTICES HAVE HOWEVER NOT YET COME INTO GENERAL USE
AUD0000001030_S0001712 AND TAKING A PERSONAL PRIDE IN A SUCCESSFUL SHOOTING SEASON
AUD0000001030_S0001719 HE IS NOT CHOICE IN THE USE OF MEANS TO THAT END
AUD0000001030_S0001726 AND TO COME FORTH WITH UNPREMEDITATED ENERGY
AUD0000001030_S0001732 ANOTHER TIME THEY HAVE PREVENTED STRAYING PHEASANTS FROM RETURNING TO THE COVERS BY INTERCEPTING THEIR RETREAT AND A SCORE OF SIMILAR TRICKS
AUD0000001030_S0001742 THE RASCAL FINDS A CLOAK FOR HIS OWN MISDEEDS
AUD0000001030_S0001747 SOME HUNDREDS OF YOUNG PHEASANTS FLOURISHING EXCEEDINGLY
AUD0000001030_S0001752 ALL THIS IS DOUBLY ANNOYING BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO THE LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SPORT THERE HAS BEEN AN EXOR BITANT EXPENDITURE
AUD0000001030_S0001761 THE ACCUSED ATTEMPTING TO EX PLAIN FINDS A STRONG PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM AND TURNS AWAY IN DUDGEON
AUD0000001030_S0001768 WHOSE GAINS WOULD BE HIS LOSS SINCE THERE WOULD REMAIN LESS FOR HIM TO SMUGGLE
AUD0000001030_S0001777 IF THEY ARE A SHADY LOT
AUD0000001030_S0001783 THINLY POPULATED IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL WHERE HE MAY BE HE HAS A REASONABLE PRETEXT FOR BEING ABOUT AT ALL HOURS
AUD0000001030_S0001792 OR TO GIVE UP THEIR ALLOTMENT GARDENS AND A GARDEN IS ALMOST AS IMPORTANT TO A COTTAGER AS HIS WEEKLY WAGES
AUD0000001030_S0001799 ANOTHER CLASS OF KEEPER IS RATHER PASSIVELY THAN ACTIVELY BAD
AUD0000001030_S0001806 GO TO SLEEP ON THE SWARD IN THE SHADE CALL AT THE ROADSIDE INN AND LEANING HIS GUN AGAINST THE TREE FROM WHICH THE SIGN HANGS
AUD0000001030_S0001811 AND FINALLY IS CORRUPTED AND SHARES THE PROCEEDS OF BOLDER RASCALS
AUD0000001030_S0001819 IF A WEAK KEEPER GETS AMONG SUCH A SET AS THIS HE SUCCUMBS AND THE SAME CAUSE HASTENS THE MORAL DECAY OF THE CONSTABLE
AUD0000001030_S0001828 SMIRCHING THE WHOLE CLASS TO WHICH THEY BELONG
AUD0000001030_S0001833 THE KEEPER WHO HAS GONE TO THE BAD BECOMES ONE OF THE MOST MISCHIEVOUS MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THE FAITHFUL AND UPRIGHT KEEPER IS NOT ONLY A VALUABLE SERVANT BUT A PROTECTION TO ALL KINDS OF PROPERTY
AUD0000001043_S0000010 AT HIS ELBOW HIS WIFE ROSE HER HEART-SHAPED FACE AND GREY EYES FRAMED BY THE WIDE FACE-WINDOW OF HER ARMOR
AUD0000001043_S0000015 LIFE CAN BE NICE OUT HERE
AUD0000001043_S0000020 ROSE'S WORDS WERE NOW LIKE DIM ECHOES OF HIS CONSCIENCE
AUD0000001043_S0000029 YOU HYDROPONIC PUN'KIN-HEAD
AUD0000001043_S0000035 TIED TO BABY'S DIAPER SUSPENDERS
AUD0000001043_S0000041 LET'S MAKE HIM SOCIABLE
AUD0000001043_S0000047 COMING OUT AGAIN FROM EARTH ACROSS THE ORBIT OF MARS TO THE ASTEROID BELT THEY HAD HAD THE ENDLICHS AS FELLOW PASSENGERS
AUD0000001043_S0000054 TAIN'T FAR
AUD0000001043_S0000061 YEAH
AUD0000001043_S0000066 AND THE OTHERS YELLING AND HOOTING MADE IT A PACK
AUD0000001043_S0000075 HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE SAVAGE RIBBING MORE CALMLY BUT THERE WAS TOO MUCH GRIM FACT BEHIND WHAT THESE ASTEROID MINERS SAID
AUD0000001043_S0000081 FOR THE MOMENT JOHN ENDLICH WAS SPEECHLESS AND STRANGLED BUT LIKE AN IGNITED FIRECRACKER
AUD0000001043_S0000086 THE KIDS HAD KEPT ON BAWLING MORE AND MORE VIOLENTLY BUT NOW THEY GOT DOWN TO VERBAL EXPLANATIONS OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS THE MATTER
AUD0000001043_S0000095 WHETHER THE LATTER IS TO BE INFLICTED ON THE ATTACKED OR THE ATTACKER REMAINS THE ONLY QUESTION MARK
AUD0000001043_S0000100 ENDLICH WAS HARDLY LACKING IN VIGOR HIMSELF
AUD0000001043_S0000106 DON'T JOHNNY PLEASE DON'T
AUD0000001043_S0000112 IT CERTAINLY WASN'T COWARDICE THAT ACCOMPLISHED THIS
AUD0000001043_S0000117 THEY WERE ITCHING TO BE ASSAULTED
AUD0000001043_S0000122 ALL SPACE WAS STILL ELECTRIFIED
AUD0000001043_S0000130 WHAT HELL COULD NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED BECAME FACT
AUD0000001043_S0000140 IT DON'T MATTER DUTCH
AUD0000001043_S0000145 HE FELT LIKE A MARTYR
AUD0000001043_S0000150 THE ROCKET JETS OF THE CRAFT EMITTED A SINGLE WEAK BURST OF FLAME LIKE A BOULDER GROWN AGILE AND FLIGHTY
AUD0000001043_S0000156 RUB WHAT'S LEFT OF YOU IN THE DUST OF YOUR CLAIM
AUD0000001043_S0000161 EVELYN
AUD0000001043_S0000167 IT BORED INTO HIS NERVES LIKE A DRILL
AUD0000001043_S0000172 DAMN THE OBVIOUS QUESTIONS OF WOMEN
AUD0000001043_S0000177 DAMN
AUD0000001043_S0000182 THROUGH JOHN ENDLICH'S MIND AGAIN THERE FLASHED A PICTURE OF WHAT THIS ASTEROID WAS LIKE
AUD0000001043_S0000187 LIKE A MAJOR PLANET OR MOST MOONS
AUD0000001043_S0000192 FOR IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM THE MESODERM OF THAT TORTURED MOTHER WORLD
AUD0000001043_S0000197 LOOK POP
AUD0000001043_S0000207 WHY DON'T YOU LOOK OVER THE OTHER WAY THERE'S THE HOUSE AND MAYBE THE BARN AND THE SHEDS AND THE OLD GARDEN
AUD0000001043_S0000213 DON'T YOU SEE
AUD0000001043_S0000218 ONE MAYBE THE HOUSE WAS OF GREY STONE
AUD0000001043_S0000225 OR HAD A GREAT BOMB AS LARGE AS AN OVERSIZED METEOR COME SELF-PROPELLED FROM SPACE TO BURY ITSELF DEEP IN THAT ANCIENT WORLD
AUD0000001043_S0000230 PERHAPS THERE WAS A SHORT AND TERRIBLE PASSING OF FLAME
AUD0000001043_S0000236 AND WITH THE SAME SWIFTNESS ALL REMAINING ARTIFACTS AND SURFACE FEATURES OF THIS CHIP OF A WORLD'S CRUST THAT WAS VESTA
AUD0000001043_S0000243 WHICH MEANT AGAIN IN PRACTICE ALL BUT ABSOLUTE ZERO
AUD0000001043_S0000249 A REVULSION
AUD0000001043_S0000254 BUBS URGED
AUD0000001043_S0000260 YEAH
AUD0000001043_S0000265 ROSE ORDERED
AUD0000001043_S0000271 AND THE CERTAINTY OF MORE TROUBLE TO COME FROM THAT SOURCE
AUD0000001043_S0000276 RIGHT NOW WE GOTTA DO WHAT WE GOTTA DO
AUD0000001043_S0000281 THEY TOLD US AT SCHOOL REMEMBER VESTA WAS THE OLD ROMAN GODDESS OF HEARTH AND HOME
AUD0000001043_S0000287 THAT WAS A ROAD
AUD0000001043_S0000293 JOHNNY
AUD0000001043_S0000298 THE BLUE SKY THE SHIFTING BEAUTY OF CLOUDS IN SUNSHINE
AUD0000001043_S0000303 ALL THE EVIDENCES OF LIFE
AUD0000001043_S0000308 KEEPING HIS DOUBTS HIDDEN BEHIND GRUFFNESS
AUD0000001043_S0000314 BUT HOW COULD ANYBODY STAND BEING HERE VERY LONG UNLESS SUCH THINGS WERE DONE
AUD0000001043_S0000319 AND IT WAS MORE BECAUSE OF THE TENSION OF HIS NERVES THAN BECAUSE OF THE VIGOR WITH WHICH HE PLIED HIS PINCHBAR
AUD0000001043_S0000324 THEY WORKED SOMEWHAT AWKWARDLY FOR THEIR INSTRUCTION PERIOD HAD BEEN BRIEF AND THEY WERE GREEN BUT THE JOB WAS SPEEDILY FINISHED
AUD0000001043_S0000329 THE ASTEROIDS HOMESTEADERS OFFICE HAD FILLED THESE BOXES ACCORDING TO A PRECISE SURVEY OF THE NEEDS OF A PEACEFUL SETTLER ON VESTA
AUD0000001043_S0000334 THE NEXT TASK PRESCRIBED BY THE HOMESTEADERS' SCHOOL WAS TO SECURE A SUPPLY OF AIR AND WATER IN QUANTITY
AUD0000001043_S0000339 AND SO SUDDENLY HAD VESTA BEEN CHILLED IN THE COLD OF SPACE AT THE TIME OF THE PARENT BODY'S EXPLOSION
AUD0000001043_S0000346 THE A H O SURVEY EXPEDITIONS HERE ON VESTA AND ON OTHER SIMILAR ASTEROIDS WHICH WERE CRUSTAL CHIPS OF THE ORIGINAL PLANET HAD DONE THEIR WORK WELL
AUD0000001043_S0000352 THE SHORT DAY EIGHTEEN HOURS LONG INSTEAD OF TWENTY-FOUR AND ALREADY FAR ADVANCED AT THE TIME OF HIS TUMULTUOUS LANDING WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE
AUD0000001043_S0000357 STILL
AUD0000001043_S0000364 AND SEVERAL HOURS LATER AMID HEAVY COOKING ODORS INSIDE THE NOW INFLATED PLASTIC BUBBLE THAT WAS THE TENT
AUD0000001043_S0000369 BUBS TRYING TO BE VERY MUCH A MAN BATTLED SLUMBER AND YAWNS AND KEPT HIS DAD COMPANY WITH SCRAPS OF CONVERSATION
AUD0000001043_S0000374 YOU GOT THE RIFLE AND THE PISTOL READY
AUD0000001043_S0000379 THANK THE LORD THAT BUBS WAS SO TRUSTING FOR HIS OWN PEACE OF MIND THE PRANKISH AND SAVAGE NATURE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF MEN WITH LIQUOR IN THEIR BELLIES BEING WHAT IT WAS
AUD0000001043_S0000387 OTHERWISE FROM ALL AROUND THE STILLNESS OF THE VACUUM WAS ABSOLUTE
AUD0000001043_S0000393 JOHN ENDLICH OBEYED HIS KID
AUD0000001043_S0000398 THE THUDDING WAS VIBRATED STRAIGHT THROUGH MANY MILES OF SOLID ROCK
AUD0000001043_S0000403 NOT LONG THEREAFTER HE WAS ASLEEP
AUD0000001043_S0000409 THUS THE HOURS SLIPPED AWAY UNTIL THE LUMINOUS DIAL OF THE CLOCK IN THE TENT IT HAD BEEN SYNCHRONIZED TO VESTAL TIME TOLD HIM THAT DAWN WAS NEAR
AUD0000001043_S0000414 IT CAME AGAIN AND STOPPED ONCE MORE AS IF SKULKING FORMS PAUSED TO FIND THEIR WAY
AUD0000001043_S0000420 THE BOX THAT CONTAINED THE MEANS OF SURVIVAL FOR HIS FAMILY AND HIMSELF AS IF HE FORESAW THE FUTURE A MOMENT AWAY
AUD0000001043_S0000426 HE DARTED OUT WITH THE OUTRUSHING AIR
AUD0000001043_S0000432 STRIKE BACK AT THEM EVEN IN SELF-DEFENSE
AUD0000001043_S0000437 HE DID JUST THAT WHEN HE RAISED HIS PISTOL STRUGGLING AGAINST THE AWFUL IMPULSE OF THE RAGE IN HIM LIFTED IT HIGH ENOUGH SO THAT THE EXPLOSIVE BULLETS THAT SPEWED FROM IT WOULD BE SURE TO PASS OVER THE HEADS OF THE DARK SILHOUETTES THAT WERE MOVING ABOUT
AUD0000001043_S0000442 AT THAT MOMENT THE SUN'S RIM APPEARED AT THE LANDSCAPE'S JAGGED EDGE AND ON THIS SIDE OF AIRLESS VESTA COMPLETE NIGHT WAS TRANSFORMED TO COMPLETE DAY
AUD0000001043_S0000448 ENDLICH KNEW THAT NEELY KNEW THAT HE WAS AFRAID FOR HIS WIFE AND WOULDN'T START ANYTHING UNLESS DRIVEN AND GOADED SHEERLY WILD
AUD0000001043_S0000453 GLAD TO OBLIGE
AUD0000001043_S0000459 NEELY AND HIS COMPANIONS HADN'T ATTEMPTED TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY OF THE EXPLOSION
AUD0000001043_S0000464 STILL ENDLICH RETAINED THE DROP ON HIM
AUD0000001043_S0000469 DON'T YOU THINK IT'S FUN
AUD0000001043_S0000475 I DARE YOU TO TRY TO SHOOT STRAIGHT PAL
AUD0000001043_S0000482 ANYWAY HALF DRUNK
AUD0000001043_S0000487 NEELY RUMBLED
AUD0000001043_S0000495 THEIR RETURN TO CAMP HUNDREDS OF MILES DISTANT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES
AUD0000001043_S0000501 IN ENDLICH WAS THE SAVAGE ENERGY OF DESPAIR
AUD0000001043_S0000506 NO DON'T WANT ANY BREAKFAST
AUD0000001043_S0000511 HE FOUND THAT HIS MAIN ATOMIC BATTERY SO NECESSARY TO ALL THAT HE HAD TO DO WAS DAMAGED AND UNWORKABLE
AUD0000001043_S0000518 THE EDGES OF THE PLASTIC WERE THEN ATTACHED TO MASSIVE METAL RAILS WHICH HE BURIED IN THE TRENCH
AUD0000001043_S0000524 THE WELL WAS IN THE AREA COVERED BY THE SHEET OF PLASTIC WHICH WAS NOW PROPPED UP HERE AND THERE WITH LONG PIECES OF BOARD FROM THE GREAT BOX
AUD0000001043_S0000530 THE FEW CYLINDERS OF THE COMPRESSED STUFF THAT WE'VE GOT WON'T BE ENOUGH TO MAKE A START AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE
AUD0000001043_S0000536 EVELYN SHRILLED
AUD0000001043_S0000545 THE NICHES IN THE STONE WALLS THE SLANTING RAMPLIKE OBJECT OF BLACKENED WOOD
AUD0000001043_S0000552 BEYOND THE CAR WAS WHAT MIGHT BE A SMALL TRACTOR AND A LOT OF ODD TOOLS
AUD0000001043_S0000558 IT WAS SEALED AND APPARENTLY SELF-CONTAINED
AUD0000001043_S0000564 NERVOUSLY HE TURNED A LITTLE WHEEL
AUD0000001043_S0000569 NO NOT LONG
AUD0000001043_S0000574 BUBS SHRILLED
AUD0000001043_S0000580 UNTIL HE GLANCED AT THE RAPIDLY DECLINING SUN
AUD0000001043_S0000586 NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
AUD0000001043_S0000593 HE GROWLED LUGUBRIOUSLY
AUD0000001043_S0000598 BUT HE FELT VERY SORRY FOR HER TOO AND HE DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT WHAT HE HAD JUST SAID WAS ENTIRELY THE TRUTH
AUD0000001043_S0000604 I'LL KEEP WATCH MAYBE IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT
AUD0000001043_S0000610 THEIR TENT WAS NOW COVERED BY THE RISING PLASTIC ROOF BUT BEYOND THE CLEAR SUBSTANCE HE COULD STILL WATCH FOR STARLIGHT TO BE STOPPED BY PROWLING FORMS OUT THERE AT THE JAGGED RIM OF VESTA
AUD0000001043_S0000619 BUT HE KNEW HOPELESSLY THAT THINGS WEREN'T QUITE THAT SIMPLE EITHER
AUD0000001043_S0000624 IT MADE A GREAT SQUARISH BUBBLE THE SKIN OF WHICH WAS SPECIALLY TREATED TO STOP THE HARD AND DANGEROUS PART OF THE ULTRA-VIOLET RAYS OF THE SUN
AUD0000001043_S0000629 THE WALLS OF THE SMALL TENT AROUND ENDLICH SAGGED WHERE THEY HAD BULGED TAUTLY BEFORE SHOWING THAT THERE WAS NOW A FIRM AND EQUAL PRESSURE BEYOND THEM
AUD0000001043_S0000634 HE WOKE UP HIS FAMILY BY SHOUTING LOOK
AUD0000001043_S0000639 BUT HAD THAT BEEN DONE ONLY TO KEEP HIM AT A FRUITLESS AND SLEEPLESS WATCH
AUD0000001043_S0000648 GOT TO PATCH UP THE PIECES OF THE HOUSE FIRST AND BOLT EM TOGETHER ROSE
AUD0000001043_S0000653 HIS WORDS RACED ON WITH HIS FLYING THOUGHTS
AUD0000001043_S0000659 SEALED THAT IS IF NEELY OR SOMEBODY DIDN'T USE A BLASTER OR AN EXPLOSIVE CAP OR BULLET IN AN ORGY OF PERVERTED HUMOR
AUD0000001043_S0000665 NERVE-TWISTING
AUD0000001043_S0000670 HE GROANED ALMOST TOO WEARY EVEN TO SWALLOW HIS FOOD IN SPITE OF THE LUXURY OF A REAL PULLMAN-STYLE SUPPER TABLE
AUD0000001043_S0000675 SHE SAID
AUD0000001043_S0000681 I REPORTED NEELY AND HIS COMPANIONS
AUD0000001043_S0000686 MATTER OF FACT I RADIOED HIM AGAIN LAST NIGHT
AUD0000001043_S0000692 JOHNNY
AUD0000001043_S0000697 ANYHOW MR MAHONEY SAID THAT WE SHOULD KEEP ON EXERCISING ALL REASONABLE CAUTION
AUD0000001043_S0000702 BUT HER HUSBAND HAD ALREADY PASSED BEYOND THOUGHTS OF JEALOUSY
AUD0000001043_S0000708 IN THEIR GREAT PLASTIC GREENHOUSE SUPPORTED LIKE A COLOSSAL BUBBLE BY THE HUMID ARTIFICIALLY-WARMED AIR INSIDE IT
AUD0000001043_S0000714 THEN HE HARROWED THE GROUND AGAIN
AUD0000001043_S0000720 SOME SEEDS OR SPORES HAD SURVIVED HERE FROM THE MOTHER WORLD OF THE ASTEROIDS
AUD0000001043_S0000726 HE HEARD IRRIGATION WATER TRICKLING
AUD0000001043_S0000731 IN CONTRAST TO THE AIRLESS DESOLATION OUTSIDE THE INTERIOR OF THIS FIVE-ACRE GREENHOUSE WAS THE ONE MOST DESIRABLE PLACE TO BE
AUD0000001043_S0000738 YES JOHNNY
AUD0000001043_S0000746 ENDLICH HAVING REPAIRED HIS ATOMIC BATTERY DIDN'T DRAW POWER ANYMORE FROM THE UNIT THAT HAD SUPPLIED THE ANCIENT BUILDINGS
AUD0000001043_S0000754 IT HAD EVIDENTLY HATCHED FROM A TINY EGG PRESERVED BY THE COLD FOR AGES
AUD0000001043_S0000759 SURE
AUD0000001043_S0000764 HIS TEMPER NEVER FLARED ONCE
AUD0000001043_S0000769 THEY WERE LIKE THE STUFF INSIDE A COMPLAINING VOLCANO
AUD0000001043_S0000777 HAVE LUCK WITH THEM JOHNNY BUT WATCH OUT
AUD0000001043_S0000782 AND HAD FORCED TOWARD MATURITY MOST

AUD0000001043_S0000794 HIS WARINESS SLIPPED INTO ABEYANCE
AUD0000001043_S0000799 FRUSTRATION IS A DANGEROUS FORCE
AUD0000001043_S0000804 THEN WITH CALM AND FOOLHARDY DETACHMENT HE SET THE SIX TOMATOES OUT IN A ROW BEFORE HIM ON THE SYNTHETIC MAHOGANY
AUD0000001043_S0000810 AGGRESSIVE AND SATANIC HUMOR
AUD0000001043_S0000815 LANDING ON HARD METAL SHAPED FOR THE INTERPLANETARY REGIONS
AUD0000001043_S0000820 YOU'RE A PRINCE

AUD0000001043_S0000897 I LOVE TOMATOES MR PUN'KINS
AUD0000001043_S0000903 WITH ALL THE STRENGTH OF HIS MUSCULAR BODY BACKED UP BY DREAD AND PENT-UP FURY HE SENT A GLOVED FIST CRASHING STRAIGHT INTO NEELY'S OPEN FACE-WINDOW
AUD0000001043_S0000908 BOTH ARMORED BODIES LACKING NOTHING IN INERTIA TORE THROUGH THE TOUGH PLASTIC WINDOW AND THEY BOUNCED LIGHTLY ON THE PAVEMENT OF THE MAIN SECTION OF THE REC-DOME
AUD0000001043_S0000913 HE JUST HAD THE RAGGED AND ALL BUT HOPELESS THOUGHT OF USING NEELY AS A HOSTAGE AS A WEAPON IN THE BITTER AND DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO DEFEND HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN FROM THE MOB THAT WOULD BE FOLLOWING CLOSE BEHIND HIM

AUD0000001047_S0000617 IT WAS BITTER TO REALIZE THAT THE TIME HAD COME WHEN JOHN COULD PREFER THE NEWSPAPER TO HIS WIFE'S SOCIETY
AUD0000001047_S0000622 BUT SOMEHOW HIS WORDS SEEMED TO FAIL HIM
AUD0000001047_S0000627 HOW LONELY AND STILL IT SEEMS IN THE WOOD WITH NO ONE HERE BUT OURSELVES
AUD0000001047_S0000632 LET'S GET OUT OF THIS
AUD0000001047_S0000637 THEN ONE EVENING IN JUNE AFTER TEA I LED JOHN DOWN A PATH BESIDE THE HOUSE TO A LITTLE CORNER BEHIND THE GARDEN WHERE THERE WAS A STONE WALL ON ONE SIDE AND A HIGH FENCE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US
AUD0000001047_S0000642 THERE'S SOMETHING I MEANT TO SAY OH JOHN I CRIED AND I FLUNG MY ARMS ROUND HIS NECK

AUD0000001047_S0000679 AND ON THE WEDDING MORNING HE WENT AND FETCHED HIM TO THE CHURCH IN A CLOSED CARRIAGE AND HAD HIM THERE ALL READY WHEN WE CAME
AUD0000001047_S0000684 AND FATHER LED JOHN UP THE AISLE AFTER ME
AUD0000001047_S0000690 AND THEY ALL SPOKE QUITE SHARPLY TO JOHN
AUD0000001047_S0000695 AND WHEN WE SAT DOWN IN THE COMPARTMENT AMONG ALL OUR BANDBOXES AND FLOWERS
AUD0000001047_S0000700 JOHN SAID
AUD0000001047_S0000705 AT FIRST I HAD THOUGHT OF GOING SOMEWHERE TO THE GREAT LONELY WOODS
AUD0000001047_S0000710 WHERE I COULD HAVE WATCHED THE GREAT WAVES DASHING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE ROCKS
AUD0000001047_S0000715 SO WE CAME TO NEW YORK
AUD0000001047_S0000720 ONE DAY I TOOK HIM TO THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM
AUD0000001047_S0000725 I HAD THE DRAWING-ROOM DONE IN BLUE
AUD0000001047_S0000730 JOHN SEEMED TO APPRECIATE HIS DEN AT ONCE
AUD0000001047_S0000735 I NOTICED IT AT FIRST IN SMALL THINGS
AUD0000001047_S0000740 AND WOULD GO ON TALKING JUST AS BRIGHTLY AS I COULD
AUD0000001047_S0000745 WAS IT COOLING I ASKED MYSELF
AUD0000001047_S0000750 BUT I KEPT NOTICING DIFFERENT LITTLE THINGS

AUD0000001047_S0000771 AND SO WE DID ALL WE COULD TO WAKE HIM UP
AUD0000001047_S0000776 I HAVE ALWAYS CALLED FORTH A GREAT DEAL OF ADMIRATION IN GENTLEMEN
AUD0000001047_S0000782 FOR THE PURPOSE SO HE SAID AT LEAST
AUD0000001047_S0000787 I HAD DETERMINED THAT IF HE TRIED TO CARRY ME DOWN WITH HIM I WOULD SCREAM FOR THE SERVANTS
AUD0000001047_S0000792 THERE WERE OTHERS TOO
AUD0000001047_S0000797 BUT I REFUSED
AUD0000001047_S0000802 HE HAD BEEN DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH ME YEARS BEFORE AT LEAST I REMEMBER HIS TAKING ME HOME FROM A HOCKEY MATCH ONCE
AUD0000001047_S0000807 BUT ONE NIGHT WHEN HE CAME OVER TO PLAY AND JOHN HAD HAD TO GO OUT
AUD0000001047_S0000813 I BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT JOHN WAS DRINKING
AUD0000001047_S0000818 TWO OR THREE TIMES WHEN MCQUEEN AND JOHN WERE TO PLAY CRIBBAGE
AUD0000001047_S0000823 AND INSTEAD OF STAYING IN HIS DEN HE WOULD WANDER ALL OVER THE HOUSE
AUD0000001047_S0000829 HE SAID
AUD0000001047_S0000834 BUT YET I FELT MORE AND MORE THAT HIS LOVE MUST BE DWINDLING TO MAKE HIM ACT AS HE DID
AUD0000001047_S0000839 SO AT LAST THE CONVICTION CAME TO ME THAT I MUST GO AWAY
AUD0000001047_S0000844 SO ONE MORNING I SAID TO JOHN
AUD0000001047_S0000850 THE COLD BRUTALITY OF IT CUT ME TO THE HEART
AUD0000001047_S0000855 SO I DECIDED ON BERMUDA INSTEAD

AUD0000001047_S0000865 AND I HOPED THAT HE WOULD TRY TO BE AS HAPPY AS HE COULD AND FORGET ME ENTIRELY

AUD0000001137_S0000943 THE CIVILIZED MAN HAS BUILT A COACH
AUD0000001137_S0000948 BUT HE FAILS OF THE SKILL TO TELL THE HOUR BY THE SUN
AUD0000001137_S0000954 BY A CHRISTIANITY ENTRENCHED IN ESTABLISHMENTS AND FORMS SOME VIGOR OF WILD VIRTUE
AUD0000001137_S0000959 AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AVAIL TO EDUCATE GREATER MEN THAN PLUTARCH'S HEROES
AUD0000001137_S0000965 BUT THEY LEAVE NO CLASS
AUD0000001137_S0000971 HUDSON AND BEHRING ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH IN THEIR FISHING-BOATS AS TO ASTONISH PARRY AND FRANKLIN
AUD0000001137_S0000978 WE RECKONED THE IMPROVEMENTS OF THE ART OF WAR AMONG THE TRIUMPHS OF SCIENCE
AUD0000001137_S0000985 UNTIL IN IMITATION OF THE ROMAN CUSTOM
AUD0000001137_S0000992 THE SAME PARTICLE DOES NOT RISE FROM THE VALLEY TO THE RIDGE
AUD0000001137_S0000998 INCLUDING THE RELIANCE ON GOVERNMENTS WHICH PROTECT IT
AUD0000001137_S0001004 THEY MEASURE THEIR ESTEEM OF EACH OTHER BY WHAT EACH HAS AND NOT BY WHAT EACH IS
AUD0000001137_S0001011 WHICH DOES NOT WAIT THE BECK OF RULERS
AUD0000001137_S0001018 THE POLITICAL PARTIES MEET IN NUMEROUS CONVENTIONS THE GREATER THE CONCOURSE AND WITH EACH NEW UPROAR OF ANNOUNCEMENT
AUD0000001137_S0001023 IN LIKE MANNER THE REFORMERS SUMMON CONVENTIONS AND VOTE AND RESOLVE IN MULTITUDE
AUD0000001137_S0001028 HE IS WEAKER BY EVERY RECRUIT TO HIS BANNER

AUD0000001137_S0001044 BUT DO THOU LEAVE AS UNLAWFUL THESE WINNINGS
AUD0000001137_S0001049 A POLITICAL VICTORY A RISE OF RENTS

AUD0000001137_S0001069 UNCONTAINABLE FLOWING FORELOOKING IN THE FIRST SENTIMENT OF KINDNESS ANTICIPATES ALREADY A BENEVOLENCE WHICH SHALL LOSE ALL PARTICULAR REGARDS IN ITS GENERAL LIGHT
AUD0000001137_S0001074 CARRIES HIM WITH NEW SYMPATHY INTO NATURE
AUD0000001137_S0001079 THE NATURAL ASSOCIATION OF THE SENTIMENT OF LOVE WITH THE HEYDAY OF THE BLOOD SEEMS TO REQUIRE THAT IN ORDER TO PORTRAY IT IN VIVID TINTS
AUD0000001137_S0001084 AND THEREFORE I KNOW I INCUR THE IMPUTATION OF UNNECESSARY HARDNESS AND STOICISM FROM THOSE WHO COMPOSE THE COURT AND PARLIAMENT OF LOVE
AUD0000001137_S0001091 THOUGH IN A DIFFERENT AND NOBLER SORT
AUD0000001137_S0001097 IT MATTERS NOT THEREFORE WHETHER WE ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE PASSION AT TWENTY
AUD0000001137_S0001103 SO CENTRAL THAT IT SHALL COMMEND ITSELF TO THE EYE AT WHATEVER ANGLE BEHOLDEN
AUD0000001137_S0001108 EACH MAN SEES OVER HIS OWN EXPERIENCE A CERTAIN STAIN OF ERROR
AUD0000001137_S0001114 EVERY THING IS BEAUTIFUL SEEN FROM THE POINT OF THE INTELLECT OR AS TRUTH
AUD0000001137_S0001119 AND FEAR
AUD0000001137_S0001125 BUT GRIEF CLEAVES TO NAMES AND PERSONS

AUD0000001137_S0001166 WITHOUT BEING TEMPTED TO UNSAY
AUD0000001137_S0001171 YET THE REMEMBRANCE OF THESE VISIONS OUTLASTS ALL OTHER REMEMBRANCES
AUD0000001137_S0001178 IN LOOKING BACKWARD THEY MAY FIND THAT SEVERAL THINGS WHICH WERE NOT THE CHARM HAVE MORE REALITY TO THIS GROPING MEMORY THAN THE CHARM ITSELF WHICH EMBALMED THEM
AUD0000001137_S0001184 AND ALL MEMORY WHEN ONE WAS GONE WHEN THE YOUTH BECOMES A WATCHER OF WINDOWS AND STUDIOUS OF A GLOVE

AUD0000001137_S0001231 HE IS SOMEWHAT HE IS A PERSON HE IS A SOUL
AUD0000001137_S0001236 SEEMS SUFFICIENT TO ITSELF
AUD0000001137_S0001242 SHE INDEMNIFIES HIM BY CARRYING OUT HER OWN BEING INTO SOMEWHAT IMPERSONAL
AUD0000001137_S0001247 HIS FRIENDS FIND IN HER A LIKENESS TO HER MOTHER OR HER SISTERS
AUD0000001137_S0001258 WE ARE TOUCHED WITH EMOTIONS OF TENDERNESS AND COMPLACENCY
AUD0000001137_S0001263 BUT AS IT SEEMS TO ME

AUD0000001157_S0000105 OUT OF WHICH SHE RAN INTO STREETS DAVID AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THOUGH WE HAVE HEARD THEM ROARING
AUD0000001157_S0000110 WHICH IS SO FULL OF PERAMBULATORS THAT YOU COULD CROSS FROM SIDE TO SIDE STEPPING ON BABIES
AUD0000001157_S0000115 WHERE THERE ARE REAL KETTLES
AUD0000001157_S0000120 WHICH WAS FULL OF WATER WHEN MALCOLM THE BOLD FELL INTO IT
AUD0000001157_S0000125 AND ONE DAY WHEN THEY WERE PLAYING NEAR THE WELL
AUD0000001157_S0000130 AND FREQUENTLY THE CHOOSING OF SIDES EXHAUSTS SO MUCH TIME THAT THERE IS SCARCELY ANY CRICKET
AUD0000001157_S0000135 WHICH IS REAL CRICKET WITH A BAT
AUD0000001157_S0000141 THERE WAS A VERY DISAGREEABLE INCIDENT ONE DAY WHEN SOME FORWARD GIRLS CHALLENGED DAVID'S TEAM
AUD0000001157_S0000146 AND WHEN YOU ARE COME TO IT YOU NEVER WANT TO GO ANY FARTHER
AUD0000001157_S0000151 AND WHEN YOU REMEMBER YOU ARE SO WET THAT YOU MAY AS WELL BE WETTER
AUD0000001157_S0000156 THE BOW-LEGGED CHILDREN IN THE GARDENS ARE THOSE WHO HAD TO WALK TOO SOON BECAUSE THEIR FATHER NEEDED THE PERAMBULATOR
AUD0000001157_S0000162 BECAUSE SHE IS RATHER LIKE A STICK UNTIL SHE IS IN THE WATER AND YOU ARE HOLDING THE STRING
AUD0000001157_S0000167 NIGHT PASSES IN A TWINK
AUD0000001157_S0000173 FOR TWO BOYS TOGETHER CANNOT ADVENTURE FAR UPON THE ROUND POND
AUD0000001157_S0000178 WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN OR WHAT SWELLED YOUR SAILS
AUD0000001157_S0000183 BUT THOSE YACHTS HAVE NOTHING IN THEIR HOLD
AUD0000001157_S0000188 YOU YACHTSMEN WITH YOUR WANDS
AUD0000001157_S0000193 PATHS FROM EVERYWHERE CROWD LIKE CHILDREN TO THE POND
AUD0000001157_S0000198 AND AT ANOTHER SO NARROW THAT YOU CAN STAND ASTRIDE THEM
AUD0000001157_S0000203 AT NIGHT AFTER THE GATES ARE CLOSED
AUD0000001157_S0000208 THOUGH HIS MOTHER HAS NEVER BEEN QUITE THE SAME BRIGHT CREATURE SINCE SO HE DESPISES THE SHEEP AS THEY RUN FROM THEIR SHEARER
AUD0000001157_S0000213 THE SHEEP ARE SO FRIGHTENED BY THE SHEARING THAT IT MAKES THEM QUITE WHITE AND THIN
AUD0000001157_S0000218 AND IF IT MAKES THEM FIGHT WITH THE WRONG ONES
AUD0000001157_S0000223 AND THEN A LIGHT FROM LAST YEAR BREAKS UPON PORTHOS
AUD0000001157_S0000228 IT IS A LOVELY LAKE
AUD0000001157_S0000233 PETER PAN SEES THEM WHEN HE IS SAILING ACROSS THE LAKE IN THE THRUSH'S NEST
AUD0000001157_S0000239 AND IT REACHES PETER PAN'S ISLAND AFTER DARK
AUD0000001157_S0000244 THAT WAS WHAT WE CALLED HIM
AUD0000001157_S0000249 AND CARRIED HIS ADDRESS INSIDE HIS HAT
AUD0000001157_S0000254 THEY HAVE BEEN CRONIES EVER SINCE
AUD0000001157_S0000260 AS PORTHOS IS ALWAYS WITH US
AUD0000001157_S0000265 AND INSTEAD OF THE BALL WE FOUND A LOVELY NEST MADE OF THE WORSTED
AUD0000001157_S0000270 AND SOON THE BIRD KNEW US AS FRIENDS
AUD0000001157_S0000275 LOOKING SO REPROACHFULLY AT US THAT WE KNEW SHE THOUGHT WE HAD DONE IT AND THOUGH DAVID TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HER
AUD0000001157_S0000284 WHAT A FOOLISH QUESTION TO ASK CERTAINLY HE DID
AUD0000001157_S0000289 PERHAPS SHE HAS FORGOTTEN
AUD0000001157_S0000295 OF COURSE IT ALSO SHOWS THAT PETER IS EVER SO OLD
AUD0000001157_S0000300 THE REASON IS THAT HE ESCAPED FROM BEING A HUMAN WHEN HE WAS SEVEN DAYS OLD HE ESCAPED BY THE WINDOW AND FLEW BACK TO THE KENSINGTON GARDENS
AUD0000001157_S0000306 AND WHEN HE HAD DONE THIS HARD AND EVEN HARDER
AUD0000001157_S0000312 FOR HAVING BEEN BIRDS BEFORE THEY WERE HUMAN
AUD0000001157_S0000318 THE UNDERSTANDING BEING THAT IT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT STORY AND THEN I RETELL IT WITH HIS ADDITIONS
AUD0000001157_S0000323 FOR THIS BOY CAN BE A STERN MORALIST BUT THE INTERESTING BITS ABOUT THE WAYS AND CUSTOMS OF BABIES IN THE BIRD-STAGE ARE MOSTLY REMINISCENCES OF DAVID'S
AUD0000001157_S0000330 IT IS WONDERFUL THAT HE COULD FLY WITHOUT WINGS
AUD0000001157_S0000336 AND THOUGHT HE WAS A BIRD EVEN IN APPEARANCE
AUD0000001157_S0000341 FOR THERE WERE A GOOD MANY FAIRIES ABOUT
AUD0000001157_S0000347 BUT OF COURSE IT WAS ONLY HIS NOSE
AUD0000001157_S0000352 WHEN A REAL BIRD FALLS IN FLOP
AUD0000001157_S0000358 HE AWOKE LONG BEFORE MORNING
AUD0000001157_S0000363 WHAT SEEMS A WARM NIGHT TO A BIRD IS A COLD NIGHT TO A BOY IN A NIGHTGOWN
AUD0000001157_S0000368 WHAT HE WANTED SO MUCH WAS HIS MOTHER TO BLOW HIS NOSE
AUD0000001157_S0000373 AND HE HOPPED DOWN TO ADDRESS THEM
AUD0000001157_S0000378 READING A POSTAGE-STAMP WHICH SOME HUMAN HAD LET FALL
AUD0000001157_S0000384 CROWDS OF FAIRIES WERE RUNNING THIS WAY AND THAT
AUD0000001157_S0000389 PETER HEARD THE LITTLE PEOPLE CRYING EVERYWHERE THAT THERE WAS A HUMAN IN THE GARDENS AFTER LOCK-OUT TIME
AUD0000001157_S0000394 AND EVEN THE LANCERS WHEN HE APPROACHED THEM UP THE HUMP
AUD0000001157_S0000399 BUT NOW HE REMEMBERED AS AN ODD THING
AUD0000001157_S0000405 HE SAT DOWN AND CRIED
AUD0000001157_S0000410 AND THE MOMENT YOU DOUBT WHETHER YOU CAN FLY
AUD0000001157_S0000415 FOR THE BOATS OF HUMANS ARE FORBIDDEN TO LAND THERE
AUD0000001157_S0000420 MUCH HEARTENED TO FIND HIMSELF AT LAST AT HOME
AUD0000001157_S0000425 AND HE LISTENED QUIETLY TO PETER'S ADVENTURES
AUD0000001157_S0000430 HOW MANY OF YOUR TOES ARE THUMBS SAID SOLOMON A LITTLE CRUELLY
AUD0000001157_S0000435 AND PETER TRIED MOST DESPERATELY HARD TO RUFFLE HIS FEATHERS
AUD0000001157_S0000440 I THINK I SHALL GO BACK TO MOTHER HE SAID TIMIDLY
AUD0000001157_S0000445 I SUPPOSE SAID PETER HUSKILY
AUD0000001157_S0000450 YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FLY AGAIN
AUD0000001157_S0000455 HE PROMISED VERY KINDLY HOWEVER TO TEACH PETER AS MANY OF THE BIRD WAYS AS COULD BE LEARNED BY ONE OF SUCH AN AWKWARD SHAPE
AUD0000001157_S0000460 AND CERTAINLY HE WAS A WISE OLD FELLOW
AUD0000001157_S0000466 THEY CAME OUT OF THE EGGS DAILY
AUD0000001157_S0000471 THOUSANDS GATHERED ROUND HIM DAILY TO WATCH HIM DO THESE THINGS
AUD0000001157_S0000534 HE HAD TO TELL THE BIRDS OF THE VALUE OF SHELLEY'S BOAT AND THOUGH THEY WERE TOO HONEST TO DEMAND IT BACK
AUD0000001157_S0000539 NOW PETER KNEW THAT UNLESS SOLOMON WAS ON YOUR SIDE
AUD0000001157_S0000544 HE LOOKED FORWARD TO RETIRING BY AND BY
AUD0000001157_S0000549 THIRTY-FOUR NUTS SIXTEEN CRUSTS
AUD0000001157_S0000554 HE CUT IT OFF HIS BANK-NOTE WITH A SHARP STICK
AUD0000001157_S0000560 BECAUSE HE SOON BECAME IRRITABLE IF OTHER PEOPLE TALKED
AUD0000001157_S0000565 AND AS A RESULT THEY DID NOT HOLD WATER
AUD0000001157_S0000570 AND THEN THE THRUSHES STOPPED CHEERING
AUD0000001157_S0000576 BUT AGAIN HE WAS PERPLEXED
AUD0000001157_S0000581 AND IT INSPIRED HIM
AUD0000001157_S0000587 WE DON'T PLACE OUR NESTS ON THE SERPENTINE THEY DID WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE AT FIRST CHASED HER FROM THE MEETING
AUD0000001157_S0000592 TO BUILD A BOAT
AUD0000001157_S0000597 WE ARE VERY BUSY PEOPLE THEY GRUMBLED AND THIS WOULD BE A BIG JOB QUITE SO SAID SOLOMON
AUD0000001157_S0000602 THEN ALL THE THRUSHES HOPPED FOR JOY
AUD0000001157_S0000608 THE STOUT RATHER GREEDY CHILDREN
AUD0000001157_S0000613 HE SENT OVER TO THE HOUSE-TOPS FOR A LOT OF SPARROWS AND ORDERED THEM TO LAY THEIR EGGS IN OLD THRUSHES' NESTS
AUD0000001157_S0000618 YOU ASK THEM
AUD0000001157_S0000623 AND PRESENTLY HE CALLED THE ROLL
AUD0000001157_S0000628 THE BOAT WAS FINISHED
AUD0000001157_S0000633 HE SLEEPS IN HIS NEST STILL
AUD0000001157_S0000638 BEING WOVEN OF GRASS AND TWIGS
AUD0000001157_S0000643 AND SAID THAT THE BOAT WOULD NOT BALANCE ON THE WATER
AUD0000001157_S0000648 FOR HE HAD A SAIL
AUD0000001157_S0000654 HE LOOKED UPWARD WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED
AUD0000001157_S0000659 HIS FACE WAS FLUSHED BUT HE NEVER LOOKED BACK
AUD0000001157_S0000664 WHEREUPON HE SHORTENED SAIL
AUD0000001157_S0000669 BUT SUSPECTED THEM
AUD0000001157_S0000674 HE PASSED UNDER THE BRIDGE AND CAME TO HIS GREAT REJOICING WITHIN FULL SIGHT OF THE DELECTABLE GARDENS
AUD0000001157_S0000679 AND HE WAS NEAR TO BEING DROWNED
AUD0000001157_S0000686 HE WAS MERCIFULLY CARRIED INTO A SMALL BAY
AUD0000001157_S0000691 THIS WITH MUCH BRANDISHING OF THEIR HOLLY-LEAVES
AUD0000001157_S0000696 NEVERTHELESS HAVING FOUND A JOLLY HARBOUR HE WAS IN NO TEMPER TO DRAW OFF THEREFROM
AUD0000001157_S0000702 WHEREUPON THEY STRAIGHTWAY LOVED HIM
AUD0000001157_S0000707 AND THEY LED HIM CIVILLY TO THEIR QUEEN
AUD0000001157_S0000713 BUT PETER NEVER GROWS ANY OLDER
AUD0000001157_S0000771 THEY STAND QUITE STILL PRETENDING TO BE FLOWERS
AUD0000001157_S0000845 AND THEN SAID THAT FOR PLAYING SO BEAUTIFULLY SHE WOULD GIVE HIM THE WISH OF HIS HEART
AUD0000001157_S0000850 COULD YOU GIVE ME THAT WISH
AUD0000001157_S0000856 IS THAT QUITE A LITTLE WISH HE INQUIRED
AUD0000001157_S0000863 I THINK I SHALL HAVE TWO LITTLE WISHES INSTEAD OF ONE BIG ONE
AUD0000001157_S0000868 HIS SECOND WISH HE WOULD HOLD IN RESERVE
AUD0000001157_S0000873 MOTHER ALWAYS KEEPS IT OPEN IN THE HOPE THAT I MAY FLY BACK HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY ASKED QUITE SURPRISED
AUD0000001157_S0000878 AND SOON HE FELT A FUNNY ITCHING IN THAT PART
AUD0000001157_S0000883 THE WINDOW WAS WIDE OPEN
AUD0000001157_S0000888 SHE LAY WITH HER HEAD ON HER HAND
AUD0000001157_S0000893 HE WAS VERY GLAD SHE WAS SUCH A PRETTY MOTHER
AUD0000001157_S0000898 O MOTHER SAID PETER TO HIMSELF
AUD0000001157_S0000903 AND SHE WOULD WAKE UP
AUD0000001157_S0000908 THAT I AM AFRAID IS HOW PETER REGARDED IT
AUD0000001157_S0000913 BUT WHY DOES PETER SIT SO LONG ON THE RAIL WHY DOES HE NOT TELL HIS MOTHER THAT HE HAS COME BACK
AUD0000001157_S0000918 CERTAINLY IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO BE HER BOY AGAIN
AUD0000001157_S0000923 THEY WERE STILL THERE
AUD0000001157_S0000928 WHEN HE HAD A GREAT ADVENTURE
AUD0000001157_S0000933 HE REMAINED SITTING ON THE FLOOR AND HELD HIS BREATH
AUD0000001157_S0000938 SHE MADE LITTLE MOANS ONLY
AUD0000001157_S0000943 SITTING ON THE RAIL AT THE FOOT OF THE BED
AUD0000001157_S0000948 O PETER HOW EXQUISITELY YOU PLAY
AUD0000001157_S0000953 BUT HESITATED ABOUT BEGINNING TO-NIGHT
AUD0000001157_S0000958 ALSO
AUD0000001157_S0000964 I PROMISE TO COME BACK HE SAID SOLEMNLY
AUD0000001157_S0000969 WANTING TO KISS HIS MOTHER
AUD0000001157_S0000974 ONE REASON WAS THAT HE HAD SO MANY GOOD-BYES TO SAY
AUD0000001157_S0000979 AND HIS LAST SAIL OF ALL
AUD0000001157_S0000985 THIS LAST REASON DISPLEASED OLD SOLOMON
AUD0000001157_S0000990 BUT MIND YOU
AUD0000001157_S0000995 AND TO BRING THIS TO PASS THEY TRIED TO TRICK HIM INTO MAKING SUCH A REMARK AS I WISH THE GRASS WAS NOT SO WET AND SOME OF THEM DANCED OUT OF TIME IN THE HOPE THAT HE MIGHT CRY
AUD0000001157_S0001000 I WISH HE ALWAYS STOPPED IN TIME
AUD0000001157_S0001005 AND HE KNEW WHAT WAS THE GREAT THING SHE CRIED FOR
AUD0000001157_S0001010 BUT THE WINDOW WAS CLOSED
AUD0000001157_S0001015 AND HE NEVER SAW HIS DEAR AGAIN
AUD0000001157_S0001021 NOT FOR MOST OF US
AUD0000001157_S0001033 AND UNLESS YOU SLEEP IN IT YOU NEVER SEE IT
AUD0000001157_S0001038 BUT ONLY THE LIGHT IN THE WINDOWS
AUD0000001157_S0001043 ANGELA CLARE WHO LOVES TO HAVE A TOOTH EXTRACTED BECAUSE THEN SHE IS TREATED TO TEA IN A SHOP
AUD0000001157_S0001049 THOUGH SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE FOR THEY JUMPED ABOUT SO
AUD0000001157_S0001054 MAIMIE WAS ALWAYS RATHER A STRANGE GIRL
AUD0000001157_S0001059 WHO WAS A MAGNIFICENT FELLOW OF SIX TOOK NOTICE OF HER
AUD0000001157_S0001064 SHE WOULD PAUSE THOUGH THE BALL WAS IN THE AIR TO POINT OUT TO YOU THAT SHE WAS WEARING NEW SHOES
AUD0000001157_S0001069 FOR WITH DARK THERE CAME INTO HER FACE A LOOK THAT I CAN DESCRIBE ONLY AS A LEARY LOOK
AUD0000001157_S0001076 BUT MAIMIE MERELY SMILED HER AGITATING SMILE
AUD0000001157_S0001081 IT IS COMING NEARER SHE CRIES
AUD0000001157_S0001088 AND THEN TONY DID MOST OF THE TALKING
AUD0000001157_S0001093 AS HE OFTEN DID WITH SPLENDID FIRMNESS
AUD0000001157_S0001098 PERHAPS SHE SAID THRILLING
AUD0000001157_S0001103 AND AFTER THAT TONY WAS A MARKED BOY
AUD0000001157_S0001109 MAIMIE WAS ONE OF THE KIND WHO LIKE TO FIX A DAY FOR DOING THINGS
AUD0000001157_S0001114 WILL IT BE TO-DAY AND THEN HE COULD ALWAYS SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WOULD NOT BE TO-DAY
AUD0000001157_S0001119 AND MANY BRIGHT LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS WERE DOING THAT
AUD0000001157_S0001124 POOR AYAH
AUD0000001157_S0001129 BUT SHE WAS UNACQUAINTED WITH THE TRICKY WAYS OF THE FAIRIES
AUD0000001157_S0001136 HER EAGER EYES ASKED THE QUESTION
AUD0000001157_S0001141 SHE DID A VERY KIND THING SHE TOOK OFF HER SCARF AND GAVE IT TO HIM
AUD0000001157_S0001146 I'M AFRAID NURSE WOULD SEE ME SO I SHAN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT
AUD0000001157_S0001152 TONY COULD ALWAYS OUTDISTANCE HER EASILY
AUD0000001157_S0001157 AT THIS BITTER SIGHT MAIMIE STOPPED BLANKLY
AUD0000001157_S0001162 TWILIGHT CREPT OVER THE GARDENS
AUD0000001157_S0001168 IT WAS THE STILLNESS OF THE GARDENS
AUD0000001157_S0001174 SO THAT'S ALL RIGHT
AUD0000001157_S0001179 I SUPPOSE IT IS A BIT COLDISH UP THERE AND THE ELM REPLIED
AUD0000001157_S0001184 SHE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST COLD
AUD0000001157_S0001190 WHERE MAIMIE ARRIVED IN TIME TO SEE A MAGNOLIA AND A PERSIAN LILAC STEP OVER THE RAILING AND SET OFF FOR A SMART WALK
AUD0000001157_S0001195 AND THEY ALL HAD CRUTCHES
AUD0000001157_S0001200 HE WAS A STREET BOY FAIRY WHO WAS RUNNING UP THE WALK CLOSING THE WEEPING TREES
AUD0000001157_S0001206 BUT A CHRYSANTHEMUM HEARD HER
AUD0000001157_S0001211 BUT YOU KNOW QUITE WELL YOU OUGHT NOT TO BE HERE
AUD0000001157_S0001217 THEY THEN SAID
AUD0000001157_S0001222 I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU FOR A WALK ONE AT A TIME YOU CAN LEAN ON ME YOU KNOW
AUD0000001157_S0001227 AND TREATING THE FOREIGN ONES QUITE AS COURTEOUSLY AS THE ENGLISH
AUD0000001157_S0001232 BUT IT WAS QUITE UNINTENTIONAL
AUD0000001157_S0001237 THE REASON SHE FELT NO MORE FEAR WAS THAT IT WAS NOW NIGHT-TIME
AUD0000001157_S0001242 IF THE FAIRIES SEE YOU THEY WARNED HER THEY WILL MISCHIEF YOU STAB YOU TO DEATH OR COMPEL YOU TO NURSE THEIR CHILDREN
AUD0000001157_S0001247 THIS MADE THEM SULKY
AUD0000001157_S0001252 HE WAS AN ORIENTAL FAIRY
AUD0000001157_S0001257 QUEEN MAB WHO RULES IN THE GARDENS
AUD0000001157_S0001263 AND THEN ALWAYS SHOOK HIS BALD HEAD AND MURMURED
AUD0000001157_S0001268 HOW I SHOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CUPIDS IN THEIR DEAR LITTLE FOOLS CAPS MAIMIE CRIED
AUD0000001157_S0001273 ON WHICH THOSE INVITED MAY WALK TO THE DANCE WITHOUT WETTING THEIR PUMPS
AUD0000001157_S0001278 TO HER SURPRISE THEY SEEMED TO BE RETURNING FROM THE BALL
AUD0000001157_S0001283 FOR IN THIS WAY DO ARISTOCRATIC FAIRIES TRAVEL ABOUT
AUD0000001157_S0001288 THE HIGH-BORN FAIRIES OBTAIN THIS ADMIRED EFFECT BY PRICKING THEIR SKIN
AUD0000001157_S0001293 AND SHE CONCLUDED THAT THIS MUST BE ANOTHER CASE IN WHICH THE DOCTOR HAD SAID COLD QUITE COLD
AUD0000001157_S0001298 BUT SOON SHE SAT IN HER HAND CHATTING GAILY AND EXPLAINING THAT HER NAME WAS BROWNIE
AUD0000001157_S0001303 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT TO REPLY
AUD0000001157_S0001308 HE HAD GONE TO A FASHIONABLE BAZAAR WHERE ALL THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADIES IN LONDON WERE ON VIEW FOR HALF A CROWN THE SECOND DAY
AUD0000001157_S0001313 MAIMIE REPEATED THIS STORY
AUD0000001157_S0001318 BUT MAIMIE'S CURIOSITY TUGGED HER FORWARD
AUD0000001157_S0001323 WAS COMPOSED OF MYRIADS OF GLOW-WORMS ALL HOLDING ON TO EACH OTHER
AUD0000001157_S0001328 IT WAS AMAZING AND EVEN IRRITATING TO HER THAT THE DUKE OF CHRISTMAS DAISIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP OUT OF LOVE FOR A MOMENT
AUD0000001157_S0001573 THE FAIRIES BUILD THE HOUSE MERELY BECAUSE IT IS SO PRETTY
AUD0000001157_S0001579 AND EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT
AUD0000001157_S0001584 AND HE DIGS A GRAVE FOR THE CHILD AND ERECTS A LITTLE TOMBSTONE
AUD0000001157_S0001589 HE PUTS THEM IN TWOS BECAUSE THEY SEEM LESS LONELY
AUD0000001157_S0001594 PHOEBE AGED THIRTEEN MONTHS AND WALTER PROBABLY STILL YOUNGER
AUD0000001157_S0001601 TO FIND THE SWEETEST LITTLE TOMBSTONE INSTEAD
AUD0000001221_S0000009 THAT THE PRESSURE OF HARD TIMES AND FINANCIAL STRESS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER FATHER TO THINK OF SENDING HER BACK IN THE FALL
AUD0000001221_S0000014 YOU WILL BE BRAVE AND TRY NOT TO DISTRESS YOUR FATHER BY SHOWING YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT TOO MUCH
AUD0000001221_S0000019 WAIT YES BUT THEN SHE COULD NOT GO ON WITH HER CLASS WITH POLLY AND EVELYN AND JOAN AND THE REST
AUD0000001221_S0000024 MOTHER
AUD0000001221_S0000029 I KNOW THERE ISN'T
AUD0000001221_S0000034 I'VE HAD ONE YEAR ANYWAY AND MAYBE I CAN TAKE A CORRESPONDENCE COURSE OR SOMETHING
AUD0000001221_S0000039 SHE WOULD REPLY QUIETLY
AUD0000001221_S0000044 TO WHICH SHE TRIED TO LISTEN PATIENTLY
AUD0000001221_S0000049 FROM JOAN AND KATHERINE IN EUROPE ALL TELLING OF THE GOOD TIMES THEY WERE HAVING
AUD0000001221_S0000055 SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD THERE SEEMED NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO
AUD0000001221_S0000060 WITH GLOWING SUN AND DEEP BLUE SKIES
AUD0000001221_S0000067 WONDERING WHY FATHER LOOKED SO FUNNY
AUD0000001221_S0000074 ALL THE FAMILY WERE LISTENING NOW
AUD0000001221_S0000083 HERE IT IS IN THE WILL TO MY GREAT NIECE ALISON FAIR
AUD0000001221_S0000088 AND YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF WHAT AUNT JUSTINA'S LEGACY IS LIKE
AUD0000001221_S0000093 IT SEEMED UNSUITABLE TO THINK OF MONEY WHEN AUNT JUSTINA WAS JUST DEAD
AUD0000001221_S0000098 AND AS LAYER AFTER LAYER OF WRAPPINGS WAS LIFTED OFF
AUD0000001221_S0000103 A CRY OF ADMIRATION AROSE AS ALISON LIFTED IT FROM THE LAST SWATHINGS AND HELD IT UP TO VIEW
AUD0000001221_S0000108 SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF HER AND SENT HER THIS BEAUTIFUL THING
AUD0000001221_S0000113 YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ME PERHAPS YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ME
AUD0000001221_S0000119 AND I WAS WRONG TO TRY TO FORCE HIM TO DO AS I WISHED
AUD0000001221_S0000124 I WANT TO LEAVE TO HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER A SMALL TOKEN OF MY INTEREST AND AFFECTION
AUD0000001221_S0000131 IF YOU HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OTHER RESOURCES
AUD0000001221_S0000136 JUSTINA LAURENCE
AUD0000001221_S0000142 AND WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE ME PRESIDENT

AUD0000001221_S0000279 IF NOT EXACTLY FORBIDDING
AUD0000001221_S0000285 UNTIL ALISON SAID PLEASANTLY
AUD0000001221_S0000290 PRETTY
AUD0000001221_S0000295 AS ALISON ENTERED AND LOOKED ABOUT HER
AUD0000001221_S0000300 AND A DRESSER CHAIR AND SMALL TABLE FOR EACH GIRL

AUD0000001221_S0000310 ONLY HANGING UP A FEW DRESSES AND LEAVING THE REST IN HER TRUNK
AUD0000001221_S0000315 AND STOOD SURVEYING THE EFFECT WHEN THERE WAS A RUSH OF LITTLE FEET IN THE CORRIDOR
AUD0000001221_S0000322 BUT YOU TOO LATE FOR US TO BE ROOMMATES JO
AUD0000001221_S0000327 JOAN SHOOK BACK HER LIGHT FLUFFY HAIR
AUD0000001221_S0000332 I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS TAKING YOUR ROOM
AUD0000001221_S0000339 CONVERSATION LANGUISHED
AUD0000001221_S0000345 ALISON SLIPPED OUT OF THE ROOM ACROSS THE HALL TO THE ROOM OPPOSITE
AUD0000001221_S0000350 IT WAS PRETTILY FURNISHED AND HER PICTURES AND RUGS WERE BETTER AND MORE LUXURIOUS THAN MOST SCHOOLGIRLS' ROOMS COULD BOAST
AUD0000001221_S0000356 I'M JUST TOO DISAPPOINTED AND CROSS FOR ANYTHING
AUD0000001221_S0000361 SAID KATHERINE EQUABLY
AUD0000001221_S0000366 AND IN THE MEAN TIME JOAN IS WELCOME WITH ME AS LONG AS SHE LIKES
AUD0000001221_S0000371 THEY FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION OF SCHOOL MATTERS
AUD0000001221_S0000376 WHOSE GOLDEN HEAD AND APPLE-BLOSSOM FACE SCARCELY SUGGESTED BOOKS OR SCHOLARSHIP
AUD0000001221_S0000381 AND CONSTERNATION REIGNED WHEN THE NEWS SPREAD THAT THE NEWCOMER HAD USURPED JOAN'S PLACE
AUD0000001221_S0000386 WE SHALL LIKE HER WHEN WE KNOW HER
AUD0000001221_S0000391 WELL DID YOU KNOW WE HAVE A NEW ENGLISH TEACHER
AUD0000001221_S0000396 ARE HELEN YORKE AND BRENDA THORNTON BACK
AUD0000001221_S0000402 IT SEEMS IT CAN FOR IT IS
AUD0000001221_S0000407 SHE GAVE THE GROUP AN APPEALING LOOK AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM
AUD0000001221_S0000417 THE DINING ROOM WAS A LARGE SQUARE LIGHT ROOM
AUD0000001221_S0000422 THE NEW ENGLISH TEACHER MISS BURNETT PRESIDED A PRETTY GIRL NOT MANY YEARS OLDER THAN HER PROSPECTIVE PUPILS
AUD0000001221_S0000427 AND EVEN COPIED HER CLOTHES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
AUD0000001221_S0000432 MISS BURNETT HAD AN EAGER CLASS
AUD0000001221_S0000438 I DON'T BELIEVE I COULD WRITE ANYTHING WORTH READING BUT I'LL TRY BECAUSE MISS BURNETT WANTS US TO
AUD0000001221_S0000443 JUST LET HER HEAR YOU SAYING GOT THAT'S ALL

AUD0000001221_S0000471 YOU'VE HAD A GRAND QUIET TIME TO WORK I WISH I HAD BEEN AS INDUSTRIOUS BUT IT WAS SO LOVELY OUT
AUD0000001221_S0000476 SAID JOAN
AUD0000001221_S0000481 BUT NO SUCH SELF-LAUDATORY OPINION WAS HINTED AT IN HER DIGNIFIED DEMEANOR
AUD0000001221_S0000486 MOST OF THE OTHER GIRLS HAD TRIED BECAUSE MISS BURNETT WISHED IT
AUD0000001221_S0000493 SHE HAD A VACANT PERIOD NEXT AND SHE TOOK A SUDDEN RESOLVE
AUD0000001221_S0000498 AS SHE OPENED HER ENGLISH LITERATURE SEVERAL HALF-SHEETS OF PAPER FELL OUT
AUD0000001221_S0000503 SHE OPENED IT PUZZLED
AUD0000001221_S0000508 WHICH WAS LIKE HERSELF PRETTY BUT ENTIRELY CHARACTERLESS
AUD0000001221_S0000513 BUT AFTER A FEW INADEQUATE SENTENCES ROSALIND'S IMAGINATION HAD APPARENTLY FAILED HER
AUD0000001221_S0000518 AS AT THE EFFORTS OF A CHILD
AUD0000001221_S0000524 ASKED ROSALIND'S VOICE
AUD0000001221_S0000531 WAS IT ABOUT THIS
AUD0000001221_S0000537 IT'S MY ESSAY
AUD0000001221_S0000544 DID YOU READ THIS ALISON

AUD0000001221_S0000556 I BORROWED MARCIA'S THE OTHER DAY AND FORGOT TO RETURN IT TO HER
AUD0000001221_S0000561 I KNOW IT WAS
AUD0000001221_S0000566 AND LEFT MARCIA STUDYING FOR HER ESSAY
AUD0000001221_S0000571 SAID ROSALIND EASILY
AUD0000001221_S0000576 OR STRAIGHTEN OUT A MUDDLE
AUD0000001221_S0000582 AND WE WERE WONDERING HOW IT GOT THERE THAT WAS ALL
AUD0000001221_S0000588 AND LEFT THE ESSAY IN IT YOU KNOW WHAT A CARELESS THING SHE IS
AUD0000001221_S0000593 I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
AUD0000001221_S0000600 I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD MIND LENDING ME YOUR BOOK OF COURSE I DIDN'T MARCIA YOU KNOW THAT
AUD0000001221_S0000605 PLEASE DON'T THINK I MEANT TO BE PERSONAL MARCIA
AUD0000001221_S0000610 WOUNDED TO THE VERGE OF TEARS BUT TO HER RELIEF MARCIA LEFT THE ROOM
AUD0000001221_S0000615 ALISON
AUD0000001221_S0000622 THE TEARS OVERFLOWED AT THE MENTION OF THEM
AUD0000001221_S0000629 NOBODY WOULD THINK IT UNLESS SHE HAD A GUILTY CONSCIENCE
AUD0000001221_S0000635 SO ALISON WAS OBLIGED TO TELL THE FACTS OF THE FINDING OF THE ESSAY IN HER BOOK AFTER IT HAD BEEN BORROWED BY MARCIA
AUD0000001221_S0000640 IF ROSALIND HAD NOT TOLD YOU WHILE SHE WAS SEARCHING FOR HER ESSAY
AUD0000001221_S0000645 SAID JOAN ADDRESSING THE COMPANY AT LARGE
AUD0000001221_S0000650 MY DEAR ALISON
AUD0000001221_S0000656 TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE

AUD0000001221_S0000686 THE BEST WAS KATHERINE'S
AUD0000001221_S0000691 ALISON'S RECEIVED SECOND PLACE TO HER OWN SURPRISE
AUD0000001221_S0000696 FINALLY THERE WERE BUT TWO PAPERS LEFT ON THE DESK
AUD0000001221_S0000701 IN THE SPACE OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED WORDS THE AUTHOR HAS REVIEWED THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE FROM ITS SOURCE TO THE PRESENT TIME
AUD0000001221_S0000707 SHE SMILED FRANKLY AND BEGUILINGLY INTO THE TEACHER'S EYES
AUD0000001221_S0000712 I COULD HARDLY DO THAT
AUD0000001221_S0000717 I HAVE KEPT THIS ONE FOR THE LAST BECAUSE I WANTED TO TALK WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT IT MARCIA
AUD0000001221_S0000723 NO ONE KNEW WHO HAD WRITTEN IT
AUD0000001221_S0000728 DID YOU TALK WITH ANYONE ELSE ABOUT YOUR ESSAY
AUD0000001221_S0000733 MISS BURNETT LOOKED GRAVE AND TROUBLED
AUD0000001221_S0000738 MARCIA LOOKED THE TEACHER STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AS IF DEFYING HER TO FIND A FLAW IN HER STATEMENT
AUD0000001221_S0000743 IF THERE WERE ANY GUILE IN THIS SPEECH
AUD0000001221_S0000749 THANKSGIVING HAD COME AND GONE AND THE GIRLS WERE SETTLED DOWN FOR THE UNEVENTFUL STRETCH THAT COMES BETWEEN THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS
AUD0000001221_S0000754 POLLY HAD A QUESTION TO PROPOUND
AUD0000001221_S0000760 I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID AT LAST
AUD0000001221_S0000766 SHE HATES SCHOOL SHE CALLS IT A JAIL
AUD0000001221_S0000772 WELL I DON'T LIKE HER AND I WISH SHE ROOMED IN ANOTHER HALL
AUD0000001221_S0000777 SHE ASKED
AUD0000001221_S0000782 AND I WAS GIRLS

AUD0000001221_S0000804 I DON'T LIKE BEING SUSPICIOUS
AUD0000001221_S0000815 ROSALIND WAS TOILING OVER A HISTORY LESSON AND WISHING THAT ALL THE KINGS AND QUEENS OF FRANCE HAD BEEN GUILLOTINED BEFORE THEY MADE TROUBLE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF SCHOOLGIRLS
AUD0000001221_S0000821 AND HOW

AUD0000001221_S0000838 IF YOU WOULD BE AFRAID TO GO WITHOUT LEAVE I'LL ASK ALISON BUT SHE'S SUCH A STICKLER FOR RULES I DIDN'T THINK SHE WOULD
AUD0000001221_S0000843 WE'LL SLIP DOWN TO THE BASEMENT
AUD0000001221_S0000850 BUT MARCIA DID NOT EXPLAIN THAT SHE HAD SEEN SARA MARSHALL THE DAY BEFORE
AUD0000001221_S0000856 THE ONLY TROUBLE IS
AUD0000001221_S0000861 OFFERED ROSALIND DISMAYED AT THE THOUGHT OF DISAPPOINTMENT
AUD0000001221_S0000867 AND THE DIE WAS CAST
AUD0000001221_S0000872 AND WITH THE DOOR SECURELY SHUT AND FASTENED
AUD0000001221_S0000877 AND THEY CREPT NOISELESSLY DOWNSTAIRS TO THE BASEMENT
AUD0000001221_S0000883 THEY CLIMBED OVER THE LOW PLACE IN THE WALL AND FOUND THEMSELVES OUT IN THE QUIET STREET
AUD0000001221_S0000888 BUT IT WAS ONLY TOM MARSHALL WHO GREETED THEM CORDIALLY
AUD0000001221_S0000894 AND WERE GLAD TO FIND THEMSELVES IN THE WARM CAR
AUD0000001221_S0000899 WHO INTRODUCED THEM TO HER FRIENDS
AUD0000001221_S0000905 NOT HAVING BEEN CONSULTED
AUD0000001221_S0000910 A PEARL NECKLACE CLASPED HER THROAT
AUD0000001221_S0000916 SHE WAS GLAD WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR BREAKING UP
AUD0000001221_S0000922 AND GOODNIGHT
AUD0000001221_S0000927 CAREFULLY THEY SCRAMBLED THROUGH AND FINALLY STOOD ON THE FLOOR SAFE AND NOBODY SAW US
AUD0000001221_S0000932 FOR A LONG MINUTE THEY FACED EACH OTHER
AUD0000001221_S0000937 I SHALL REPORT YOU ABSENT WITHOUT LEAVE
AUD0000001221_S0000942 THE GIRLS SCURRIED NOISELESSLY UP TWO LONG FLIGHTS OF STAIRS AND REACHED ROSALIND'S ROOM WITHOUT MEETING ANYONE
AUD0000001221_S0000947 WITH NO SENSE OF WRONGDOING TO HOUND HER
AUD0000001221_S0000952 YOU WERE VERY WILLING TO LISTEN AT THE TIME IT SEEMS TO ME
AUD0000001221_S0000958 I DIDN'T CONTRADICTED ROSALIND TOO EXASPERATED TO SYMPATHIZE AND PRESENTLY SHE WAS IN BED WITH THE COVERS PULLED OVER HER HEAD
AUD0000001221_S0000963 AND SHE CRIED HERSELF TO SLEEP
AUD0000001221_S0000968 AND OPENING THE DOOR NOISELESSLY
AUD0000001221_S0000973 DAYLIGHT WAS BRIGHTENING THE WINDOWS BEFORE SHE FELL INTO A TROUBLED DOZE
AUD0000001221_S0000979 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CARVED OUT OF STONE AS SHE STOOD WITH HER LOWERING BROW
AUD0000001221_S0000984 SHE WAS FRANKLY CRYING
AUD0000001221_S0000990 I AM SORRY YOU HAD NOT CONFIDENCE ENOUGH IN ME TO TELL ME ABOUT IT
AUD0000001221_S0000995 DEFIANT EXPRESSION
AUD0000001221_S0001003 THEN TELL ME AT WHOSE HOUSE YOU WERE AND WHAT TOOK YOU THERE
AUD0000001221_S0001009 SHE SAID SHE WAS GLAD YOU DID NOT OBJECT HERE MARCIA GAVE A WARNING GLANCE IN ROSALIND'S DIRECTION
AUD0000001221_S0001015 IN A HOARSE DEFIANT VOICE
AUD0000001221_S0001020 ROSALIND ANSWERED AS MARCIA SEEMED DETERMINED NOT TO SPEAK AGAIN
AUD0000001221_S0001025 IN FACT AS MISS HARLAND KNEW SHE WAS TOO SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD TO BE OTHER THAN TRUTHFUL
AUD0000001221_S0001030 MISS HARLAND FELT THAT THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION SOMEWHERE
AUD0000001221_S0001035 BUT RELIEVED THAT THE AFFAIR WAS NO WORSE THAN A SCHOOLGIRL'S NATURAL LOVE OF A SECRET ADVENTURE
AUD0000001221_S0001041 YOU WILL BE RESTRICTED FOR ONE MONTH OR UNTIL AFTER CHRISTMAS
AUD0000001221_S0001047 ROSALIND LINGERED SOBBING
AUD0000001221_S0001052 AND I WAS SCARED ALL THE TIME THAT SOMEBODY WOULD RECOGNIZE US
AUD0000001221_S0001057 THE PRETTY FACE WAS VERY PLEADING AS ROSALIND LOOKED UP WITH BLUE EYES DROWNED IN TEARS
AUD0000001221_S0001062 YOU MEAN GOD
AUD0000001221_S0001073 RACHEL IN THE WINDOW SEAT
AUD0000001221_S0001078 THE GIRLS WERE ALL TALKING AT ONCE

AUD0000001221_S0001126 OF COURSE WE BELIEVE YOU
AUD0000001221_S0001131 SAID KATHY GRAVELY
AUD0000001221_S0001136 AND SHOWED THE TWO MISSING ARTICLES UNDER DISCUSSION
AUD0000001221_S0001141 HOW DID IT HAPPEN THAT YOU DIDN'T FIND THEM BEFORE
AUD0000001221_S0001146 AND I WAS HUNTING FOR A COLLAR
AUD0000001221_S0001151 BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN

AUD0000001221_S0001168 ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY OCCUPIED BY THREE SUBSTANTIAL GIRLS

AUD0000001221_S0001178 IT'S GONE
AUD0000001221_S0001186 IT WASN'T THERE
AUD0000001221_S0001192 SAID ALISON BEGINNING TO CRY AGAIN
AUD0000001221_S0001197 I DON'T KNOW
AUD0000001221_S0001202 SHE RAN ACROSS THE HALL TO ALISON'S ROOM
AUD0000001221_S0001207 DEMANDED JOAN
AUD0000001221_S0001212 A HASTY BUT THOROUGH SEARCH ESTABLISHED THE CERTAINTY THAT MARCIA WAS NOT IN ANY OF THE BUILDINGS
AUD0000001221_S0001217 JOAN AS USUAL WAS THE SPOKESWOMAN
AUD0000001221_S0001222 SHE PUT BACK THE OTHER THINGS SHE BORROWED AND TRIED TO THROW THE BLAME ON ROSALIND BY HIDING THEM IN HER DRAWER
AUD0000001221_S0001227 IF JOAN IS RIGHT WE OUGHT TO REPORT MARCIA'S DISAPPEARANCE AT ONCE
AUD0000001221_S0001233 THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS WERE SEARCHED AGAIN WITH NO RESULT

AUD0000001221_S0001258 AND BEING IN HASTE TO CATCH THE AFTERNOON TRAIN
AUD0000001221_S0001263 BUT MR WEST SHOOK HIS HEAD
AUD0000001221_S0001268 AND SHE WOULD HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO SAY GOODBYE TO THE GIRLS AND MISS HARLAND
AUD0000001221_S0001274 AND WITH HER DEPARTED SOMETHING THAT HAD SPOILED THE SPIRIT OF CONCORD AND HAPPINESS WHICH USUALLY PREVAILED IN THE SCHOOL
AUD0000001221_S0001279 ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL WITH ALISON BUT FOR THE GRIEF FOR THE LOSS OF HER LAMP
AUD0000001221_S0001285 COULD NOT HAVE LEFT THE ROOM BY ITSELF
AUD0000001221_S0001290 THE GIRLS WERE BUSY WITH PLANS FOR THE TWO WEEKS' VACATION
AUD0000001221_S0001295 THE PRETTY SCARF FOR FLOSS

AUD0000001221_S0001317 BUT THEY ONLY LAUGHED AND ENJOYED THE FROLIC AS THEY RAN DOWN THE STEEP HILLSIDE AND REACHED THE LEVEL STREET ON WHICH THE STORES WERE
AUD0000001221_S0001322 IT WAS A LENGTHY ORDEAL
AUD0000001221_S0001327 JOAN SAID

AUD0000001221_S0001368 AND IF I WOULD BUY IT FROM HER
AUD0000001221_S0001373 SHE WAS COMING BACK TO GET IT LATER
AUD0000001221_S0001379 SHOULD SHE RISK LEAVING IT IN MR DELANY'S SHOP EVEN OVERNIGHT
AUD0000001221_S0001384 BUT I WANT MY LAMP BACK AT ONCE TO TAKE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS

AUD0000001221_S0001434 THE CLASS HISTORY WAS PRONOUNCED FAIRLY GOOD
AUD0000001221_S0001439 AND THEY REALIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF FAITHFUL WORK
AUD0000001221_S0001444 AND NOW WITH THE CLOSE OF THE SENIOR YEAR THE CLASS HAD WON ITS LAURELS CONCLUDED THE HISTORIAN AND ONE SENSED THE LONG BREATH OF RELIEF WITH WHICH SHE FINISHED HER TASK
AUD0000001221_S0001449 AND THEN SUDDENLY CLOSED THE BOOK
AUD0000001221_S0001454 AND LET US MEET HERE IN THIS VERY ROOM TEN YEARS FROM NOW AND SEE HOW MANY OF HER PROPHECIES HAVE COME TRUE
AUD0000001221_S0001459 YOU

AUD0000001221_S0001470 I'M GOING TO FLY
AUD0000001221_S0001475 IT WAS RACHEL'S TURN
AUD0000001221_S0001481 ROSALIND SMILED AND BLUSHED ALL OVER HER PRETTY FLOWER-LIKE FACE
AUD0000001221_S0001486 KATHY HAD BEEN WRITING AND NOW READ HER NOTES A TEACHER AT BRIARWOOD A FLYER A GREAT TRAVELER A DOMESTIC SCIENCE TEACHER A MUSICIAN A LAWYER AND A TRAINED NURSE
AUD0000001221_S0001491 THE PROPHECY PURPORTED TO BE ITEMS FROM NEWSPAPERS OF THE FUTURE
AUD0000001221_S0001497 WITH MISS ALISON FAIR AS HEAD NURSE
AUD0000001221_S0001503 A RECENT ITEM IN A MISSIONARY MAGAZINE TELLS US THAT MISS JOAN WENTWORTH HAS DECIDED TO DEVOTE HER LIFE AND TALENTS TO THE MISSIONFIELD
AUD0000001221_S0001509 HELEN MAY HISTORIAN
AUD0000001221_S0001514 BUT IN ANY CASE WE CAN ONLY DO OUR VERY BEST IN WHATEVER PLACE IN LIFE WE MAY FIND OURSELVES
AUD0000001221_S0001519 BUT THE WORDS HAD COME TO HER INSTINCTIVELY
AUD0000001221_S0001524 TOMORROW THEY WOULD SEPARATE
AUD0000001259_S0000007 YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE BRAINS THAN THAT DIGRIZ HE SNARLED
AUD0000001259_S0000013 JUST BECAUSE I HEAD THE SPECIAL CORPS DOESN'T MEAN THAT I AM THE SPECIAL CORPS HE SAID MOISTLY WHILE HE DRAINED THE GLASS
AUD0000001259_S0000018 HE WAS AT MY MERCY REALLY
AUD0000001259_S0000023 ONE EYE OPENED SLOWLY
AUD0000001259_S0000029 THAT COULD PROBABLY TURN ANY FLEET EXISTENT TODAY INTO FINE RADIOACTIVE ASH EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THE LAST ONE WAS BROKEN UP FOR SCRAP OVER A THOUSAND YEARS AGO HE MUMBLED
AUD0000001259_S0000036 OH IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO WATCH
AUD0000001259_S0000042 TALK BLAST YOU DIGRIZ TALK HE ROARED
AUD0000001259_S0000047 I SAVORED MY SMALL MOMENT OF POWER
AUD0000001259_S0000052 AT THE SAME TIME IT WILL GET THE RECORDS IN SHAPE
AUD0000001259_S0000058 BREAKING MY SPIRIT UNDER THE GUISE OF GIVING ME A LITTLE BACKGROUND IN THE CORPS ACTIVITIES IN THIS SENSE YOUR PLAN FAILED
AUD0000001259_S0000063 INDEXES IT TO EVERY CATEGORY IT CAN POSSIBLY RELATE THEN FILES IT
AUD0000001259_S0000068 YOU'VE STOLEN ENOUGH OF THEM IN YOUR TIME
AUD0000001259_S0000073 WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT HE MUMBLED AS HE RAN HIS EYES OVER THE BLUEPRINTS
AUD0000001259_S0000078 BUT AS I SAID I KNOW MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SHIPS
AUD0000001259_S0000083 YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN AFTER THREE MINUTES OF GROANING
AUD0000001259_S0000089 I WAS STILL TEASED AS I HAD NO IDEA WHAT A SHIP THIS LARGE COULD BE USED FOR
AUD0000001259_S0000095 INSKIPP GRABBED AGAIN AND BEGAN COMPARING THE TWO PRINTS
AUD0000001259_S0000100 THE HULLS ARE IDENTICAL
AUD0000001259_S0000105 OF COURSE THIS COULD ALL BE COINCIDENCE THE PLANS OF A NEWLY BUILT SHIP AGREEING TO SIX PLACES WITH THOSE OF A SHIP BUILT A THOUSAND YEARS AGO
AUD0000001259_S0000112 CITTANUVO SECOND PLANET OF A B STAR IN CORONA BOREALIS
AUD0000001259_S0000117 WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME TROUBLE CAME FROM SOME OUT-OF-THE-WAY SPOT I NEVER EVEN KNEW EXISTED
AUD0000001259_S0000122 MODESTY PREVENTED ME FROM SPEAKING FIRST BUT I HAD A VERY SHORT WAIT BEFORE INSKIPP REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION I HAD
AUD0000001259_S0000127 YET WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH IT WHEN THEY HAVE IT BUILT
AUD0000001259_S0000133 I HAVE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THEM
AUD0000001259_S0000140 AND THIS ISN'T REALLY AN OPERATION
AUD0000001259_S0000148 SINCE MY FORCED INDUCTION INTO THE CORPS SIX MONTHS EARLIER I HAD BEEN STUCK ON THIS SUPER-SECRET PLANETOID THAT WAS ITS HEADQUARTERS AND MAIN BASE
AUD0000001259_S0000153 AFTER A FEW HAPPY YEARS OF SUCCESSFUL CRIME YOU BEGIN TO WONDER HOW LONG IT WILL LAST
AUD0000001259_S0000159 SOUNDS LIKE TV DRAMA STUFF
AUD0000001259_S0000164 BUT I STILL THINK IT WAS A WISE MOVE
AUD0000001259_S0000169 SIX MONTHS OF THIS HAD ME SLIGHTLY GA-GA AND I WANTED OUT
AUD0000001259_S0000178 IT DIDN'T FIT
AUD0000001259_S0000185 I PUT IT OUT OF MY MIND AND WORKED ON SOME TRI-DI CHESS PROBLEMS
AUD0000001259_S0000190 LET PEOPLE VERY OBVIOUSLY SEE WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO SEE
AUD0000001259_S0000195 THE STURDY LITTLE M THREE ROBOT RUMBLED AFTER ME WITH MY BAGS
AUD0000001259_S0000200 THAT'S WHAT I LIKE MAKES ME FEEL GRATEFUL VERY PLEASED TO MEET YOU
AUD0000001259_S0000206 THE SHIP IS OPEN THEY CAN CHECK THAT WHENEVER THEY PLEASE
AUD0000001259_S0000212 PEEKED INTO ONE OR TWO FOR CONFORMITY'S SAKE
AUD0000001259_S0000220 SOME OF IT QUITE LETHAL AND EXPLOSIVE AND VERY EMBARRASSING IF IT WAS DISCOVERED IN MY BAGS
AUD0000001259_S0000225 THE BRAIN WAS AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER ROBOT BRAIN I HAVE KNOWN
AUD0000001259_S0000230 ALL ROOMS CHECKED
AUD0000001259_S0000237 IT CAME COMPLETE WITH DECORATIONS GOLD BULLION
AUD0000001259_S0000244 BUT THE GOLD-ENCRUSTED HELMET AND A BRIEF CASE OF PAPERS WERE A PROBLEM
AUD0000001259_S0000249 THE THING HAD MORE DRAWERS IN IT THAN A BATTERY OF CASH REGISTERS
AUD0000001259_S0000255 I PULLED ON A FANCY SPORTS CAP BUCKLED THE CAPE UP TIGHT AND WAS READY TO GO
AUD0000001259_S0000260 I USED A BACK STAIRS AND WE MET IN THE STREET
AUD0000001259_S0000265 I TOOK MYSELF AND A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY KILO ROBOT THROUGH THE GUARDS AND ALARMS WITHOUT CAUSING THE SLIGHTEST STIR
AUD0000001259_S0000271 IF I HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN BLACKMAIL I HAD ENOUGH EVIDENCE IN MY HAND TO SUPPORT ME FOR LIFE
AUD0000001259_S0000276 I SAT BEHIND HIS DESK ALL HIS PERSONAL PAPERS BEFORE ME WEIGHTED DOWN WITH A PISTOL AND AS FIERCE A SCOWL AS I COULD RAISE SMEARED ACROSS MY FACE
AUD0000001259_S0000281 WHEN HE SAW THE PAPERS ON THE DESK HIS EYES BULGED AND HE JUST GURGLED A LITTLE
AUD0000001259_S0000287 IT GAVE HIM TIME TO REGAIN A BIT OF CONTROL AND HE USED IT TO BLUSTER
AUD0000001259_S0000292 I AM ARRESTING YOU FOR CONSPIRACY EXTORTION THEFT AND WHATEVER OTHER CHARGES DEVELOP AFTER A CAREFUL REVIEW OF THESE DOCUMENTS
AUD0000001259_S0000297 I CAN EXPLAIN HE SAID DESPERATELY EVERYTHING CAN BE EXPLAINED
AUD0000001259_S0000303 ALL THOSE QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED BY A COURT AT THE PROPER TIME
AUD0000001259_S0000308 WHEN HE MANAGED TO SPEAK THE WORDS WERE COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY HE HAD ALREADY REGISTERED EVERY EVIDENCE OF INJURED INNOCENCE
AUD0000001259_S0000314 EXAMINED THE INITIALS AND SUCH
AUD0000001259_S0000320 I PHRASED MY QUESTION CAREFULLY AS I HAD HIM RIGHT WHERE I WANTED HIM NOW
AUD0000001259_S0000325 I SAT BACK WITH A RELAXED SIGH AND LIT A CIGAR
AUD0000001259_S0000331 WHILE YOU TALKED IT REGISTERED YOUR SKIN TEMPERATURE BLOOD PRESSURE
AUD0000001259_S0000337 REPORT
AUD0000001259_S0000342 EXACTLY SEVENTY-FOUR PER CENT OF ALL STATEMENTS HE MADE WERE FAKE
AUD0000001259_S0000349 HE HAD NO IDEA I WASN'T INTERESTED IN HIS OTHER HANKY-PANKY
AUD0000001259_S0000354 BUT IF HE WASN'T RESPONSIBLE WHO WAS
AUD0000001259_S0000360 AS SOON AS I SHOWED HIM THE DIFFERENT BLUEPRINTS AND EXPLAINED THE POSSIBILITIES HE UNDERSTOOD
AUD0000001259_S0000366 TRYING TO GET A LINE TO HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS
AUD0000001259_S0000372 THE SPACEYARD MANAGER WAS NAMED ROCCA AND HE WAS HAPPILY ASLEEP WHEN WE ARRIVED
AUD0000001259_S0000377 TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION
AUD0000001259_S0000382 ANYONE WITH LESS SELF-ESTEEM THAN MYSELF OR WHO HAD LED A MORE HONEST EARLY LIFE MIGHT HAVE DOUBTED HIS OWN REASONING AT THAT MOMENT
AUD0000001259_S0000387 IF THERE ARE TWO CHOICES TO TAKE TAKE THE SIMPLER
AUD0000001259_S0000392 ROCCA I BARKED IN WHAT I HOPED WAS AUTHENTIC OLD SPACE-DOG MANNER
AUD0000001259_S0000397 NO THE PLANS WERE CHANGED
AUD0000001259_S0000402 HE RUBBED HIS JAW WHILE HE LOOKED AT IT
AUD0000001259_S0000407 BIG THING LOTS OF POWER LEADS IT WAS A BATTLESHIP ALL RIGHT NO DOUBT OF THAT NOW
AUD0000001259_S0000413 REMEMBER THERE WAS SOME TROUBLE
AUD0000001259_S0000418 CAUSING A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TROUBLE
AUD0000001259_S0000423 CARS GUNS I BELLOWED TO THE SPACEYARD
AUD0000001259_S0000429 THE SHIP WAS GONE
AUD0000001259_S0000435 THE GOVERNMENT WAS INVOLVED FOR SURE BUT ONLY AS A PAWN
AUD0000001259_S0000441 HAD STAGGERED BACK AND WAS PULLING AT HIS HAIR CURSING AND CRYING AT THE SAME TIME
AUD0000001259_S0000447 I HAD TO FIND THE BATTLESHIP BEFORE IT BLASTED ITS WAY ACROSS THE GALAXY
AUD0000001259_S0000455 BUT IT WAS ENOUGH
AUD0000001259_S0000460 THESE PEOPLE HAD IT DOWN TO A FINE SCIENCE
AUD0000001259_S0000466 THIS WOULD HAVE TAKEN TOO LONG
AUD0000001259_S0000471 ALL I HAD TO DO WAS SUGGEST A LINE OF SEARCH AND THE RELEVANT DOCUMENTS WOULD BEGIN APPEARING AT ONCE
AUD0000001259_S0000477 A PARTY OR PARTIES UNKNOWN HAD NEATLY WARPED THE SHIP CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM TO THEIR OWN ENDS
AUD0000001259_S0000482 ORDERS WERE ORIGINATED IN MANY PLACES PASSED ON
AUD0000001259_S0000488 ALL THE GIRLS HAD FOOD POISONING
AUD0000001259_S0000494 LIKE A SPIDER ON ITS WEB PULLING THE STRINGS THAT SET THINGS INTO MOTION
AUD0000001259_S0000500 HE ALSO HAD A SECRETARY WHOSE ILLNESSES COINCIDED WITH HER EMPLOYMENT IN OTHER OFFICES
AUD0000001259_S0000506 YOU'VE FOUND THEM THE CRIMINAL RING HE ASKED HIS FINGERS GROPING OVER HIS SCALP FOR A FRESH HOLD
AUD0000001259_S0000511 THE GIRL IS CALLED ANGELINA
AUD0000001259_S0000517 I SHALL DO NOTHING I TOLD HIM WITH THE SNAPPED PRECISION OF AN OLD SPACE DOG
AUD0000001259_S0000524 THIS WAS STILL A JOB FOR THE CORPS INSKIPP WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN THE LATEST INFORMATION AT ONCE
AUD0000001259_S0000529 THE PSIMAN WAS IN HIS TRANSPARENT CUBICLE AND I LOCKED MYSELF IN WITH HIM
AUD0000001259_S0000534 I WAITED UNTIL HIS ATTENTION CLICKED BACK INTO THE ROOM
AUD0000001259_S0000539 HE READ THE CODE WORDS CAREFULLY SHAPING THEM WITH HIS MOUTH BUT NOT SPEAKING ALOUD
AUD0000001259_S0000545 AND I TOOK THE CODE GROUPS DOWN IN SHORTHAND MYSELF
AUD0000001259_S0000551 THAT GOT RID OF THE SMILE
AUD0000001259_S0000556 I WOULD KEEP MY IDENTITY AS AN ADMIRAL FOR THE REST OF THE JOB
AUD0000001259_S0000561 NEVER A WORD ABOUT MY EFFORTS IN UNCOVERING THE PLOT IN THE FIRST PLACE
AUD0000001259_S0000566 AND WAITING WAS ALL I COULD DO
AUD0000001259_S0000571 WHICH WAS WAITING FOR BAD NEWS
AUD0000001259_S0000577 THEY HAD COVERED THEIR TRACKS WELL
AUD0000001259_S0000582 I SHUFFLED THE MEAGER FINDINGS CONTROLLED MY IMPATIENCE
AUD0000001259_S0000588 THE MESSENGER WOKE ME FROM A DEEP SLEEP
AUD0000001259_S0000593 THE NAVY BOYS KNOW THEIR BUSINESS
AUD0000001259_S0000599 TRIANGULATION HAD LEAD INVESTIGATORS TO THE SPOT WHERE THEY FOUND A FREIGHTER OGGET'S DREAM
AUD0000001259_S0000604 HE HAD USED IT IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE
AUD0000001259_S0000609 THE THIEVES WERE NOW MURDERERS
AUD0000001259_S0000614 DESTROYING ANYONE WHO STOOD IN HIS WAY
AUD0000001259_S0000619 EXCEPT WHERE WAS HE
AUD0000001259_S0000625 THAT WAS MY PROBLEM IT HAD KEPT ME AWAKE NIGHTS AND TALKING TO MYSELF DAYS
AUD0000001259_S0000630 THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS THE FACT I HAD FORCED HIM TO MAKE HIS PLAY BEFORE HE WAS ABSOLUTELY READY
AUD0000001259_S0000637 NOW I HAD TO KEEP PUSHING UNTIL HE FELL
AUD0000001259_S0000642 PUFFING ON IT STARING AT THE SMOOTH BULKHEAD RELAXED ME A BIT
AUD0000001259_S0000647 I WAS TALKING TO MYSELF
AUD0000001259_S0000652 WHY ALL THE TROUBLE AND YEARS OF WORK TO GET A SHIP THAT TWO PEOPLE COULD JUST BARELY MANAGE
AUD0000001259_S0000657 WHICH MEANT HE HAD MORE IN MIND THAN SIMPLE PIRACY
AUD0000001259_S0000662 A PLAN WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE SHAPE IN MY HEAD BUT I DIDN'T RUSH IT
AUD0000001259_S0000669 GETTING A CREW WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT IN THESE PEACEFUL TIMES ALTHOUGH I COULD THINK OF A FEW ANSWERS TO THAT ONE TOO
AUD0000001259_S0000674 I SHUDDERED A BIT AS THE THOUGHT HIT ME
AUD0000001259_S0000680 I MIGHT BE WRONG ON SOME OF THE MINOR DETAILS
AUD0000001259_S0000686 GET THE COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER IN HERE AT ONCE
AUD0000001259_S0000691 AND I REALIZED MY ENTHUSIASM HAD CARRIED ME OUT OF CHARACTER
AUD0000001259_S0000696 WHILE HALF HIS CREW WAS INVOLVED IN GETTING OUT WHAT APPEARED TO BE INSANE INSTRUCTIONS
AUD0000001259_S0000701 THERE WEREN'T TOO MANY OF THESE AT FIRST AND THE PSIMAN COULD HANDLE THEM ALL CALLING EACH IN TURN AND SENDING BY NEWS RELEASES TO THE NAVAL PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICERS THERE
AUD0000001259_S0000706 THE RELEASE AND FOLLOW-UPS ALL HARPED ON ONE THEME
AUD0000001259_S0000711 IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER I WANTED THE BASIC INFORMATION IN EVERY MAGAZINE NEWSPAPER AND JOURNAL INSIDE THAT EXPANDING SPHERE
AUD0000001259_S0000716 BOREDOM OR CURIOSITY HAD DRIVEN HIM OUT
AUD0000001259_S0000721 WHAT CONNECTION DOES THIS TRIPE HAVE WITH CATCHING THOSE MURDERERS
AUD0000001259_S0000729 I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE RICH
AUD0000001259_S0000737 IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE HE GROWLED
AUD0000001259_S0000744 THIS PEPE IS SMART AND AS TRICKY AS A FIXED GAMBLING MACHINE
AUD0000001259_S0000749 I TRY NOT TO BE I TOLD HIM
AUD0000001259_S0000754 WHATEVER ELSE HE IS AFTER HE IS GOING TO TAKE ALL OF THE MAGAZINES AND PAPERS HE CAN FIND
AUD0000001259_S0000759 I BRIDLED MY TEMPER AND TRIED ONE LAST TIME
AUD0000001259_S0000765 I NEVER HEARD WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE WHICH IS ALL RIGHT SINCE HE WAS GETTING UNDER MY SKIN AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO PULL MY PSEUDO-RANK
AUD0000001259_S0000770 HE LOOKED AT ME WHILE HE TALKED AND HIS FACE WAS HARD AND COLD
AUD0000001259_S0000775 IF MY PLAN DOESN'T WORK CAPTAIN THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH OF MY SKIN LEFT TO PICK UP WITH A TWEEZER
AUD0000001259_S0000781 WHILE THE PSIMAN UNFOCUSED HIS EYES AND MUMBLED UNDER HIS BREATH I RIFFLED SOME PAPERS RELAXED AND COOL
AUD0000001259_S0000786 AMONG OTHER THINGS IT LEFT NEWSPAPERS CONTAINING THE ARTICLE
AUD0000001259_S0000791 I STROLLED OUT SLOWLY IN COMMAND OF THE SITUATION
AUD0000001259_S0000798 I PRESSED THE BUTTON
AUD0000001259_S0000803 ALL THE FITTINGS INSIDE AND OUT WERE EITHER MACHINE-TURNED OR PLATED
AUD0000001259_S0000808 IF THAT HAPPENED IT WOULD BE BEST IF I STAYED THERE
AUD0000001259_S0000813 NOTHING HAS CHANGED
AUD0000001259_S0000819 WOULD HE BE INTERESTED IN THE PLANETARY HOMESTEADING GEAR
AUD0000001259_S0000825 IT TOOK AN EFFORT TO CONCENTRATE ON ANYTHING ELSE
AUD0000001259_S0000830 BUT THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE
AUD0000001259_S0000835 THE RADIO BLEEPED AT ME FOR ATTENTION AT THE SAME TIME
AUD0000001259_S0000841 BUT MY OWN SCREEN STAYED DARK
AUD0000001259_S0000846 OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T SEE MY HANDS
AUD0000001259_S0000851 LOOKING AROUND FOR A WAY TO ESCAPE AND TAKING A PEEK AT THE OUTSIDE SCANNERS
AUD0000001259_S0000856 WIPING AWAY THE WORRIED BILLIONAIRE EXPRESSION
AUD0000001259_S0000861 AND THE ONE IN THE GENERATOR ROOM CAME ON
AUD0000001259_S0000867 AND I WOULD ADVISE YOU NOT TO TRY
AUD0000001259_S0000872 I GRABBED UP THE MONITOR RECEIVER AND RAN TOWARDS THE AIR LOCK
AUD0000001259_S0000877 I WAS IN SPACE NOW LEAPING ACROSS TO THE GIGANTIC WALL OF THE OTHER SHIP
AUD0000001259_S0000883 THERE WAS NO GETTING OUT OF IT
AUD0000001259_S0000889 YEAH YEAH I TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT YOU'RE A FLYING BOMB
AUD0000001259_S0000894 WAS THE DOOR TO THE CONTROL ROOM
AUD0000001259_S0000900 THE GIRL CAUGHT WISE FIRST SHE SPUN AROUND AND POINTED
AUD0000001259_S0000905 REAL OR FAKED I DIDN'T CARE
AUD0000001259_S0000913 ANGELINA ASKED HER EYES WERE OPEN NOW
AUD0000001259_S0000919 SIT UP PEPE
AUD0000001259_S0000924 ANGELINA WAS ON HER FEET NOW HER BACK PRESSED TO THE WALL
AUD0000001259_S0000929 THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO I TOLD HER
AUD0000001259_S0000934 IN FACT HE WAS LAUGHING NOT CRYING
AUD0000001259_S0000940 THE WHOLE PLAN BUILDING THE BATTLESHIP THEN STEALING IT WAS HERS
AUD0000001259_S0000946 THE COLD FEELING WAS NOW A BALL OF ICE THAT THREATENED TO PARALYZE ME
AUD0000001259_S0000951 THERE'S NO POINT IN LYING NOW
AUD0000001259_S0000956 WE COULD FEEL THE VIBRATION DISTANTLY THROUGH THE FLOOR
AUD0000001259_S0000962 BUT SHE KNOWS THAT I LOVED HER TO THE END
AUD0000001259_S0000967 AND I COULDN'T BE BLAMED IF THE GIRL HAD SLIPPED AWAY
AUD0000001259_S0000972 BUT IT WASN'T GOING TO BE BIG ENOUGH TO HIDE ANGELINA NOW
AUD0000001283_S0000008 THE LONG VEINS ROSE UP ON HIS ARMS
AUD0000001283_S0000017 SILVER AND PEARL WAS HER TAIL AND THE GREEN WEEDS OF THE SEA COILED ROUND IT AND LIKE SEA-SHELLS WERE HER EARS AND HER LIPS WERE LIKE SEA-CORAL
AUD0000001283_S0000024 AND STRUGGLED THAT SHE MIGHT ESCAPE
AUD0000001283_S0000029 I WILL NOT LET THEE GO SAVE THOU MAKEST ME A PROMISE THAT WHENEVER I CALL THEE THOU WILT COME AND SING TO ME FOR THE FISH DELIGHT TO LISTEN TO THE SONG OF THE SEA FOLK
AUD0000001283_S0000034 EVERY EVENING THE YOUNG FISHERMAN WENT OUT UPON THE SEA AND CALLED TO THE MERMAID
AUD0000001283_S0000045 AND OTHERS HE TOOK WITH A SPEAR
AUD0000001283_S0000050 BUT SHE WOULD NOT AND WHEN HE SOUGHT TO SEIZE HER SHE DIVED INTO THE WATER AS A SEAL MIGHT DIVE
AUD0000001283_S0000056 WITH LIPS PARTED AND EYES DIM WITH WONDER HE SAT IDLE IN HIS BOAT AND LISTENED
AUD0000001283_S0000062 THEN COULD I LOVE THEE AND THE YOUNG FISHERMAN SAID TO HIMSELF
AUD0000001283_S0000071 BUT HOW SHALL I SEND MY SOUL FROM ME CRIED THE YOUNG FISHERMAN
AUD0000001283_S0000076 THE NOVICE LOOKED OUT THROUGH THE WICKET AND WHEN HE SAW WHO IT WAS HE DREW BACK THE LATCH AND SAID TO HIM
AUD0000001283_S0000081 TELL ME HOW I CAN SEND MY SOUL AWAY FROM ME
AUD0000001283_S0000088 THERE IS NO THING MORE PRECIOUS THAN A HUMAN SOUL
AUD0000001283_S0000094 AND THEY WHO WOULD TRAFFIC WITH THEM ARE LOST ALSO
AUD0000001283_S0000099 THE FAUNS LIVE IN THE FOREST AND ARE GLAD
AUD0000001283_S0000106 I HAVE HEARD THEM AT NIGHT-TIME AND THEY HAVE SOUGHT TO LURE ME FROM MY BEADS
AUD0000001283_S0000112 FOR THEM THERE IS NO HEAVEN NOR HELL
AUD0000001283_S0000118 FOR HER BODY I WOULD GIVE MY SOUL AND FOR HER LOVE I WOULD SURRENDER HEAVEN
AUD0000001283_S0000123 AND ONE OF THEM CAME FORTH TO MEET HIM AND CALLED HIM BY NAME AND SAID TO HIM
AUD0000001283_S0000128 OF WHAT USE IS A MAN'S SOUL TO US
AUD0000001283_S0000135 THE PRIEST TELLETH ME THAT THE SOUL IS WORTH ALL THE GOLD IN THE WORLD
AUD0000001283_S0000140 AND A CLOUD OF DUST FOLLOWED HIM AS HE SPED ROUND THE SAND OF THE SHORE
AUD0000001283_S0000147 FISH FOR THY NET WHEN THE WIND IS FOUL
AUD0000001283_S0000153 BUT I HAVE A PRICE PRETTY BOY

AUD0000001283_S0000533 WHEN ONE STOPS TO SPEAK TO THEM THEY THROW PINCHES OF FRANKINCENSE UPON A CHARCOAL BRAZIER AND MAKE THE AIR SWEET
AUD0000001283_S0000540 FROM THE TEA-HOUSES COMES THE SOUND OF THE GUITAR
AUD0000001283_S0000546 IN THE MARKET-PLACE STAND THE FRUITSELLERS WHO SELL ALL KINDS OF FRUIT RIPE FIGS WITH THEIR BRUISED PURPLE FLESH
AUD0000001283_S0000551 ITS TRUNK WAS PAINTED WITH VERMILION AND TURMERIC
AUD0000001283_S0000557 ONE EVENING I MET SOME NEGROES CARRYING A HEAVY PALANQUIN THROUGH THE BAZAAR
AUD0000001283_S0000563 AT LAST THEY STOPPED AT A SQUARE WHITE HOUSE
AUD0000001283_S0000572 WHEN I SAW THAT I KNEW WHO THE WOMAN WAS AND WHEREFORE SHE HAD SMILED AT ME

AUD0000001283_S0000598 AT THE END OF THE GARDEN STOOD A LITTLE PAVILION
AUD0000001283_S0000604 THEY WENT BACK TO THE PALACE THE EUNUCHS FOLLOWING SLOWLY BEHIND AND PLUCKING THE SWEET MULBERRIES FROM THE TREES AS THEY PASSED
AUD0000001283_S0000609 BEHIND HIM STOOD A BRASS TURBANED NUBIAN NAKED DOWN TO THE WAIST AND WITH HEAVY EARRINGS IN HIS SPLIT EARS
AUD0000001283_S0000614 THE BLADE WHIZZED THROUGH ME AND DID ME NO HURT

AUD0000001283_S0000634 THE EMPEROR TOUCHED ONE OF THE WALLS AND IT OPENED AND WE PASSED DOWN A CORRIDOR THAT WAS LIT WITH MANY TORCHES
AUD0000001283_S0000639 THERE WERE HUGE TORTOISE-SHELLS FULL OF PEARLS AND HOLLOWED MOONSTONES OF GREAT SIZE PILED UP WITH RED RUBIES
AUD0000001283_S0000646 THE PILLARS WHICH WERE OF CEDAR WERE HUNG WITH STRINGS OF YELLOW LYNX-STONES

AUD0000001283_S0000691 AND A GREAT DESIRE CAME OVER HIM
AUD0000001283_S0000696 AND THE YOUNG FISHERMAN SAW STRETCHED BEFORE HIM UPON THE SAND THAT SHADOW OF THE BODY THAT IS THE BODY OF THE SOUL

AUD0000001283_S0000820 BUT CLOSED HIS LIPS WITH THE SEAL OF SILENCE AND WITH A TIGHT CORD BOUND HIS HANDS AND JOURNEYED BACK TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH HE HAD COME
AUD0000001283_S0000826 AND CALLED TO THE LITTLE MERMAID
AUD0000001283_S0000831 THOU ART AS ONE WHO IN TIME OF DEATH POURS WATER INTO A BROKEN VESSEL

AUD0000001283_S0000890 AND TO THE DEAD THING HE MADE CONFESSION

AUD0000001283_S0000917 AND THE SEA CAME NEARER AND SOUGHT TO COVER HIM WITH ITS WAVES
AUD0000001283_S0000923 AND THE SEA COVERED THE YOUNG FISHERMAN WITH ITS WAVES
AUD0000001283_S0000928 AND HAVING MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS HE CRIED ALOUD AND SAID
AUD0000001283_S0000935 AND IN THE CORNER OF THE FIELD OF THE FULLERS WHERE NO SWEET HERBS GREW THEY DUG A DEEP PIT AND LAID THE DEAD THINGS WITHIN IT
AUD0000001283_S0000940 AND THEIR BEAUTY TROUBLED HIM AND THEIR ODOUR WAS SWEET IN HIS NOSTRILS
AUD0000001283_S0000946 BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE WHITE FLOWERS TROUBLED HIM
AUD0000001283_S0000952 AND THE DEACONS CAME IN AND BEGAN TO UNROBE HIM AND TOOK FROM HIM THE ALB AND THE GIRDLE
AUD0000001283_S0000957 WHAT FLOWERS THEY ARE WE CANNOT TELL
AUD0000001283_S0000962 AND CAME TO THE SHORE OF THE SEA
AUD0000001283_S0000968 AND THE PEOPLE WERE FILLED WITH JOY AND WONDER
AUD0000001381_S0000008 THAT'S ALL HE REPLIED WITH BREVITY AND I CHANGED THE SUBJECT
AUD0000001381_S0000013 CARNACKI SNUGGED HIMSELF COMFORTABLY DOWN IN HIS BIG CHAIR
AUD0000001381_S0000019 AND IT IS A STORY TOO
AUD0000001381_S0000024 AND WHEN HE CAME I FOUND THAT HE WISHED ME TO INVESTIGATE AND SEE WHETHER I COULD NOT CLEAR UP A LONG-STANDING AND WELL TOO WELL AUTHENTICATED CASE OF WHAT HE TERMED HAUNTING
AUD0000001381_S0000030 PLEADING EXCUSES FOR HIS ABSENCE
AUD0000001381_S0000035 HE IS AN OLD AND PRIVILEGED SERVANT
AUD0000001381_S0000040 AND THIS EVEN THOUGH THE BUTLER KNEW IT WAS LOCKED
AUD0000001381_S0000047 THREE PEOPLE HAD BEEN STRANGLED IN IT AN ANCESTOR OF HIS AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD
AUD0000001381_S0000054 TO WAIT TILL THE MORNING
AUD0000001381_S0000060 THERE ISN'T MANY GHOSTS LIKE OURS SIR HE ASSURED ME WITH MOURNFUL PRIDE
AUD0000001381_S0000065 OF COURSE I LAUGHED AT HIM AGAIN
AUD0000001381_S0000070 IT WAS ONE TO HIM YOU KNOW
AUD0000001381_S0000075 THE ROOM FELT A LITTLE LESS INHUMANLY DREARY THOUGH MIND YOU IT WAS QUITE FRESH AND WELL KEPT IN EVERY WAY
AUD0000001381_S0000080 AND WENT HERE AND THERE ABOUT MY WORK
AUD0000001381_S0000085 HE APOLOGIZED BUT MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT I DID NOT REALIZE THE DANGER OF THE ROOM AND I COULD SEE GENERALLY THAT HE WAS IN A PRETTY FRIGHTENED STATE
AUD0000001381_S0000090 ALL THIS HAD TAKEN ME FAR LONGER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED AND SUDDENLY I HEARD A CLOCK STRIKE ELEVEN
AUD0000001381_S0000096 AND THEN IN THE SAME MOMENT ONE OF THE CANDLES ON THE TABLE TO THE LEFT WENT OUT
AUD0000001381_S0000103 I BLEW OUT THE CANDLE THAT WAS STILL ALIGHT THEN I WENT TO THOSE ON THE TWO TABLES AND BLEW THEM OUT
AUD0000001381_S0000109 IT WAS ALMOST AS IF THE WINDOW HAD BEEN SUDDENLY OPENED A LITTLE
AUD0000001381_S0000114 SOMEHOW DO YOU KNOW AS I DID SO I THOUGHT I FELT SOMETHING PULL BACK ON IT BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONLY FANCY
AUD0000001381_S0000121 POOR OLD BEGGAR
AUD0000001381_S0000126 AND I AM SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS NOT SORRY
AUD0000001381_S0000131 I RETURNED TO MY ROOM LOCKED THE DOOR AND WENT TO BED
AUD0000001381_S0000136 I JUMPED OUT OF BED AND GOT MY REVOLVER
AUD0000001381_S0000141 I'VE GONE INTO TOO MANY CASES CONNECTED WITH GHOSTLY THINGS TO BE ACCUSED OF THAT BUT I TELL YOU I FUNKED IT SIMPLY FUNKED IT
AUD0000001381_S0000147 DAYLIGHT CAME AT LAST AND I WASHED AND DRESSED
AUD0000001381_S0000152 SOMETIMES IT IS MORE THAN JUST COWARDICE I FANCY
AUD0000001381_S0000157 WENT QUIETLY ALONG THE PASSAGE
AUD0000001381_S0000163 HE CAME ON UP THE STAIRS AND HELD OUT THE LITTLE TRAY TO ME
AUD0000001381_S0000168 I KNEW YOU WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT THE SEALS
AUD0000001381_S0000173 I'M GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT THE BRUTES HAVE BEEN UP TO
AUD0000001381_S0000178 I RIPPED IT OFF AND UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND WENT IN RATHER CAUTIOUSLY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE BUT THE WHOLE ROOM WAS EMPTY OF ANYTHING TO FRIGHTEN ONE
AUD0000001381_S0000183 JOVE YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW QUEER I FELT
AUD0000001381_S0000188 HE WENT OVER TO THE BED COVERINGS AND WAS GOING TO PICK THEM UP AS DOUBTLESS HE HAD DONE EVERY DAY THESE TWENTY YEARS BACK BUT I STOPPED HIM
AUD0000001381_S0000193 AND SO RETURNED TO THE GREY ROOM AND WITH PETER'S HELP
AUD0000001381_S0000199 AFTER DINNER PETER AND I UNPACKED SOME OF MY STUFF
AUD0000001381_S0000204 THE LAST THING I DID BEFORE LEAVING WAS TO UNCAP THE LENS AND AFTER THAT I WENT OFF TO MY BEDROOM AND TO BED FOR I INTENDED TO BE UP AT MIDNIGHT AND TO ENSURE THIS I SET MY LITTLE ALARM TO CALL ME ALSO I LEFT MY CANDLE BURNING
AUD0000001381_S0000211 STARING UP THE PASSAGE TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE I KNEW MY CAMERA STOOD OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF THE GREY ROOM
AUD0000001381_S0000216 THERE CAME THE SUCCEEDING DARKNESS AND I PEERED NERVOUSLY UP THE CORRIDOR LISTENING TENSELY
AUD0000001381_S0000221 THE SOUND SEEMED TO FILL THE WHOLE OF THE LARGE CORRIDOR
AUD0000001381_S0000226 AND THEN IT CAME AGAIN THUD THUD THUD
AUD0000001381_S0000232 I MADE ONE BACKWARD SPRING INTO MY ROOM AND SLAMMED AND LOCKED THE DOOR
AUD0000001381_S0000237 MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING TO THINK
AUD0000001381_S0000242 AND WENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR IN THE HALF LIGHT TO CAP THE LENS OF MY CAMERA
AUD0000001381_S0000248 WE BOTH WENT ALONG TO THE GREY ROOM
AUD0000001381_S0000254 THE BEDCLOTHES HAD BEEN TORN OFF AND HURLED INTO THE LEFT-HAND CORNER
AUD0000001381_S0000259 LET'S GET OUT OF HERE I SAID
AUD0000001381_S0000264 I GOT BACK IN A CAB ABOUT HALF-PAST FIVE WITH MY APPARATUS AND THIS PETER AND I CARRIED UP TO THE GREY ROOM
AUD0000001381_S0000269 HE SAID YES SIR AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS THINKING THAT I WAS GOING TO TURN IN
AUD0000001381_S0000274 I LOCKED AND SEALED MYSELF IN AND SET TO WORK
AUD0000001381_S0000281 A BROAD BELT RIGHT AROUND THE CHALKED CIRCLE
AUD0000001381_S0000286 JUST WITHIN THE LINE OF CHALK
AUD0000001381_S0000293 IN THE FIVE POINTS OF THE STAR I PLACED FIVE PORTIONS OF THE BREAD
AUD0000001381_S0000298 IN WHICH I BELIEVE MY LIFE WAS SAVED BY A VERY SIMILAR FORM OF PROTECTION
AUD0000001381_S0000305 YOU KNOW HOW THAT TURNED OUT
AUD0000001381_S0000310 HE LOST HIS POWER ALMOST AS IF IT CUT HIM OFF FROM THE IMMATERIAL
AUD0000001381_S0000316 I ASK QUESTIONS AND KEEP MY EYES OPEN
AUD0000001381_S0000322 FOR THE WINDOW WAS GREY AND UNFRIENDLY
AUD0000001381_S0000328 YET TO WHAT EXTENT MATERIALIZATION OF AN AB-NATURAL CREATURE IS POSSIBLE
AUD0000001381_S0000333 AND THE FIERCE SLAMMING OF THE DOOR I HAD HEARD MYSELF
AUD0000001381_S0000338 THEN SUDDENLY
AUD0000001381_S0000344 YET I COULD SEE NOTHING UNUSUAL NO OPENING NOTHING
AUD0000001381_S0000350 LOCKED AND SEALED IN THAT ROOM
AUD0000001381_S0000355 I WAS MADE CONSCIOUS OF IT
AUD0000001381_S0000361 THEN MY ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE BED
AUD0000001381_S0000366 WHILST I RUBBED MY RIGHT HAND DRY UPON MY KNEE THOUGH NEVER FOR AN INSTANT TAKING MY GAZE OR MY ATTENTION FROM THOSE MOVING CLOTHES
AUD0000001381_S0000372 AND REACHED ROUND FOR IT BUT WITHOUT LOOKING AWAY FROM THE BED
AUD0000001381_S0000377 THE BEDCLOTHES HAD BEEN THROWN WITH SUCH SAVAGENESS
AUD0000001381_S0000382 SEEMING TO RUN UP MY SPINE AND OVER THE BACK OF MY HEAD FOR THE SEAL THAT SECURED THE DOOR HAD JUST BEEN BROKEN
AUD0000001381_S0000387 AND THEN IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SOMETHING DARK AND INDISTINCT MOVED AND WAVERED THERE AMONG THE SHADOWS
AUD0000001381_S0000392 CAN YOU UNDERSTAND
AUD0000001381_S0000397 FROM THE CAT THERE ROSE SUDDENLY A HIDEOUS CATERWAUL
AUD0000001381_S0000403 DURING THE NEXT TWO OR THREE MINUTES THERE WAS AN ODD NOTICEABLE QUIETNESS IN THE ROOM
AUD0000001381_S0000408 AND I GOT A LITTLE HOLD OF MYSELF AND ABRUPTLY I SAW THE THING I WAS LOOKING FOR
AUD0000001381_S0000415 IT RETIRED ALMOST BEYOND THE GLOW OF THE VACUUM LIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0000420 FALLING ON TO MY LEFT HAND AND HIP IN A WILD ENDEAVOR TO GET BACK FROM THE ADVANCING THING
AUD0000001381_S0000425 THEN JUST AS SUDDENLY AS IT HAD SWEPT OVER
AUD0000001381_S0000430 FOR I KNEW NOW THAT THE GREY ROOM WAS HAUNTED BY A MONSTROUS HAND
AUD0000001381_S0000435 I PUT IT BACK QUICKLY AND FELT ALMOST SAFE AGAIN
AUD0000001381_S0000442 A LITTLE LATER AS THOUGH IN A SUDDEN FIT OF MALIGNANT RAGE
AUD0000001381_S0000447 THE NEXT INSTANT THE THING MADE ONE SWIFT VICIOUS DART AT ME FROM OUT OF THE SHADOWS
AUD0000001381_S0000452 AS I KNELT THERE CAME TO ME PRESENTLY A VAGUE WONDER AT THE TWO ACCIDENTS WHICH HAD SO NEARLY ALLOWED THE BRUTE TO GET AT ME
AUD0000001381_S0000457 EVEN AS I DID SO THE VAST BLACK HALF-MATERIALIZED HAND BEAT UP AT ME OUT OF THE SHADOWS
AUD0000001381_S0000463 WHICH IS FELT ONLY UPON THE TOO NEAR APPROACH OF THE AB-HUMAN AND IS MORE DREADFUL IN A STRANGE WAY
AUD0000001381_S0000468 I MIGHT SIMPLY WORK MY OWN DESTRUCTION
AUD0000001381_S0000474 TWICE MORE WAS THE BODY OF THE DEAD CAT MOLESTED
AUD0000001381_S0000479 IN A SINGLE MOMENT AND I COULD SEE NO SIGN OF THE HAND
AUD0000001381_S0000484 IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE DAY HAD FULLY COME THAT I MADE ANY ATTEMPT TO LEAVE THE BARRIER
AUD0000001381_S0000489 I GOT IT UNLOCKED IN A NERVOUS AND CLUMSY FASHION
AUD0000001381_S0000494 I TOLD HIM I MEANT TO HAVE A SLEEP AS I HAD BEEN UP ALL NIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0000499 I SWITCHED OFF THE CURRENT FROM THE PENTACLE WHICH I HAD LEFT ON IN MY HURRY ALSO I REMOVED THE BODY OF THE CAT
AUD0000001381_S0000504 I DID SO AND HEARD MY WIRE RING ON METAL
AUD0000001381_S0000509 THE CURIOUS THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT IT WAS MADE IN THE FORM OF A PENTAGON THAT IS THE SAME SHAPE AS THE INSIDE OF THE MAGIC PENTACLE
AUD0000001381_S0000515 IT APPEARS THAT YOUNG SIR HULBERT AN ANCESTOR OF ANDERSON'S MADE A BET IN DRINK YOU KNOW
AUD0000001381_S0000520 SLEPT A SECOND NIGHT IN THE ROOM
AUD0000001381_S0000525 SUPPOSING THAT IT WERE IN A WAY A DOORWAY YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN A SORT OF GAP IN THE WORLD-HEDGE
AUD0000001381_S0000534 YOU SEE
AUD0000001381_S0000541 WHEN HE HAD GONE DOWNSTAIRS I LET MYSELF INTO THE ROOM AND LOCKED AND SEALED THE DOOR
AUD0000001381_S0000546 IT WOULD BE TO EXPRESS IT LOOSELY INSULATED
AUD0000001381_S0000551 FOR IT WAS ALREADY LATER THAN I CARED TO BE IN THAT ROOM UNPROTECTED
AUD0000001381_S0000556 FROM THEN ONWARD FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS I SAT QUIETLY
AUD0000001381_S0000561 AND I WHIPPED ROUND WITH A HIDEOUS QUAKE OF FEAR
AUD0000001381_S0000566 THE RING WAS THERE CLOSE BESIDE ME WHERE I HAD PUT IT
AUD0000001381_S0000571 A QUEER INDISTINCT SMOKE BECAME VISIBLE TO ME
AUD0000001381_S0000576 MY GOODNESS DO YOU REALIZE IT
AUD0000001381_S0000581 AT LAST I GRIPPED IT YET IN THE SAME INSTANT IT WAS TORN FROM MY GRASP WITH INCREDIBLE AND BRUTAL FORCE
AUD0000001381_S0000587 THE HAND WAS PLUNGING TOWARD ME YET EVEN AS IT HAD BEEN UNABLE TO PASS INTO THE PENTACLE WHEN THE RING WAS WITHOUT
AUD0000001381_S0000593 I LOCKED IT AND GOT TO MY ROOM SOMEHOW FOR I WAS TREMBLING SO THAT I COULD HARDLY STAND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE
AUD0000001381_S0000599 I OPENED THE DOOR AND PEEPED IN
AUD0000001381_S0000604 NOTHING IN THE ROOM WAS TOUCHED AND I KNEW THAT THE BRUTE HAD NEVER MANAGED TO CROSS THE PENTACLES
AUD0000001381_S0000610 FIVE MINUTES LATER THE LUCK RING ONCE THE LUCK BUT NOW THE BANE OF THE ANDERSON FAMILY
AUD0000001381_S0000615 WELL I ASKED AT LENGTH AFTER EXAMINING IT AND HANDING IT ROUND TO THE OTHERS
AUD0000001381_S0000620 OLD PETER NEARLY FAINTED WHEN HE KNEW THAT I MEANT TO BUT BY THE THIRD NIGHT HE SEEMED TO REALIZE THAT THE HOUSE WAS JUST SAFE AND ORDINARY
AUD0000001381_S0000628 THIS IS A CURIOUS YARN THAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU SAID CARNACKI AS AFTER A QUIET LITTLE DINNER WE MADE OURSELVES COMFORTABLE IN HIS COZY DINING ROOM
AUD0000001381_S0000634 IT SEEMS THAT WHEN WENTWORTH WENT OVER TO TAKE POSSESSION HE FOUND THE PLACE IN VERY POOR REPAIR
AUD0000001381_S0000639 AND ARRANGE FOR SOMEONE TO GO IN AS CARETAKER
AUD0000001381_S0000644 HE MANAGED TO GET A SORT OF EXPLANATION FROM THE MAN
AUD0000001381_S0000649 AND HAD PROBABLY THOUGHT THE BIG EMPTY PLACE SUITABLE FOR A NIGHT'S FREE LODGING
AUD0000001381_S0000654 THEY WERE BUT ISOLATED ACCIDENTS SPREAD OVER A LARGE NUMBER OF YEARS BY THE MEMORY OF THE VILLAGERS
AUD0000001381_S0000659 TRIED THEIR BEST TO PERSUADE HIM NOT TO GO
AUD0000001381_S0000665 BUT POOR OLD DENNIS WAS QUITE SHOCKED I BELIEVE AT THE SUGGESTION AND THOUGH TABBIT THE AGENT
AUD0000001381_S0000670 LEADING A GREAT BULLMASTIFF AND OFFERED IT TO HIM TO TAKE TO KEEP HIM COMPANY
AUD0000001381_S0000675 HE WENT THROUGH THE CROWD OF MEN AND FOUND SUDDENLY THAT THEY HAD ALL TURNED IN A BODY AND WERE KEEPING HIM COMPANY
AUD0000001381_S0000680 HE SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD STAY WITH HIM AND KEEP HIM COMPANY THROUGH THE NIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0000687 AND BY JOVE HE GOT THEM TO AGREE
AUD0000001381_S0000692 YOU SEE HE DID NOT WANT TO FRIGHTEN THE OTHERS FROM ACCOMPANYING WENTWORTH
AUD0000001381_S0000701 SHURE HE SAID
AUD0000001381_S0000715 THE MAN'S SERIOUS SIMPLICITY TOOK HOLD OF WENTWORTH
AUD0000001381_S0000721 SO AS TO MAKE THINGS SEEM CHEERFUL AND TO GET THEM YEARNING
AUD0000001381_S0000729 AS THOUGH PUSHED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND
AUD0000001381_S0000735 WHICH DREW THE ATTENTION OF THE WHOLE COMPANY
AUD0000001381_S0000741 THEN WENTWORTH WENT OUT FROM THE MEN A LITTLE AND AIMED HIS GUN AT THE DOORWAY
AUD0000001381_S0000746 WENTWORTH LOADED HIS GUN QUICKLY AND CALLED TO THE DOG BUT THE BRUTE WAS BURROWING AWAY IN AMONG THE MEN AND THIS FEAR ON THE DOG'S PART FRIGHTENED WENTWORTH MORE HE TOLD ME THAN ANYTHING
AUD0000001381_S0000752 AND NO ONE SAID A WORD
AUD0000001381_S0000757 HE LIFTED IT AND LOOKED
AUD0000001381_S0000762 AND THE HALL WAS SUDDENLY DARK
AUD0000001381_S0000768 WHICH DOES NOT SURPRISE ME
AUD0000001381_S0000774 THESE AND THE GRIM ANCIENT LOOK OF THE OLD BUILDING
AUD0000001381_S0000780 LATER WHILST WENTWORTH STOOD GUARD WITH HIS SHOTGUN
AUD0000001381_S0000786 AND YOU KNOW THE CARE I TAKE AT THIS PERIOD IS EXTREME FOR I HAVE SOLVED HUNDREDS OF CASES OF SO-CALLED HAUNTINGS AT THIS EARLY STAGE SIMPLY BY THE MOST MINUTE INVESTIGATION
AUD0000001381_S0000793 WITH THIS IN VIEW I WENT TO THE NEIGHBORING TOWN OF GAUNT AND BY AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE CHIEF CONSTABLE I OBTAINED THE SERVICES OF SIX POLICEMEN WITH THEIR RIFLES
AUD0000001381_S0000799 I WAS GOING TO RUN NO RISK OF BEING DECEIVED BY GHOSTLY HALLUCINATION OR MESMERIC INFLUENCE
AUD0000001381_S0000804 AND THERE I DROVE A STAPLE INTO THE FLOOR TO WHICH I TIED THE DOG WITH A SHORT TETHER
AUD0000001381_S0000810 AFTER THAT I PLACED LIGHTED CANDLES BEFORE EACH OF THE SEALED DOORS
AUD0000001381_S0000820 WHEN THIS WAS COMPLETE I CALLED FOR CANDLES FROM MY STOCK OF MATERIAL
AUD0000001381_S0000826 THEN FROM CANDLE TO CANDLE I TOOK A GAYRD OF HUMAN HAIR
AUD0000001381_S0000831 TO THIS END I GOT THE MEN WELL TOGETHER AND BEGAN TO FIT THE ELECTRIC PENTACLE RIGHT AROUND US
AUD0000001381_S0000837 WHICH AS I HAVE SAID COME RIGHT UP AROUND THE HOUSE VERY THICK
AUD0000001381_S0000843 AND AFTERWARD I DREW A CIRCLE WITH CHALK AROUND THEM AND OPPOSITE TO THEIR FEET I MADE THE EIGHT SIGNS OF THE SAAAMAAA RITUAL
AUD0000001381_S0000849 FOR THE REST THERE WAS TO BE NO SHOOTING UNLESS I GAVE THE WORD
AUD0000001381_S0000854 WENTWORTH SAT BEHIND THE FIRST SIGN AND AS THE NUMBERING WENT ROUND REVERSED THAT PUT HIM NEXT TO ME ON MY LEFT
AUD0000001381_S0000860 AND THE LOW DULL SOUND OF THE FIRE IN THE BIG FIREPLACE
AUD0000001381_S0000867 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN HOUR LATER THAT IT CAME TO ME SUDDENLY THAT I WAS AWARE OF AN EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF DREENESS AS IT WERE
AUD0000001381_S0000872 STEADY KEEP STEADY I SHOUTED
AUD0000001381_S0000877 SUDDENLY THE DOGS SET UP A TREMENDOUS BARKING
AUD0000001381_S0000883 SOME INVISIBLE THING WAS MEDDLING WITH IT
AUD0000001381_S0000888 AND NOT A SOUND CAME FROM THE DOGS
AUD0000001381_S0000896 THE GREAT ENTRANCE DOOR WAS BEING SLOWLY CLOSED
AUD0000001381_S0000901 JUST AS IT DID BEFORE HE WHISPERED
AUD0000001381_S0000910 PRESENTLY HOWEVER THEY CEASED EVEN FROM THIS
AUD0000001381_S0000916 AND I SAW THAT THE CANDLE BEFORE ONE OF THE SEALED DOORS HAD BEEN PUT OUT
AUD0000001381_S0000921 THERE WAS A TIME IN WHICH I SAT HALF-BLINDED BY THE GREAT GLARE OF THE FLASH AND I BLAMED MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING REMEMBERED TO BRING A PAIR OF SMOKED GOGGLES
AUD0000001381_S0000927 THEN I WAS ABLE TO SEE AGAIN AND I STARED HERE AND THERE ABOUT THE HALL BUT THERE WAS NOTHING SHOWING UNUSUAL ONLY OF COURSE IT WAS DARK NOW OVER IN THE CORNERS
AUD0000001381_S0000934 IT CONVEYED TO ME SUCH A SENSE OF A CALM DELIBERATE FORCE PRESENT IN THE HALL THE STEADFAST INTENTION TO MAKE A DARKNESS WAS HORRIBLE
AUD0000001381_S0000940 IN THE POSITION IN WHICH I HAD PUT THEM
AUD0000001381_S0000946 FOOLISH RUN FOR AN IMPOSSIBLE SAFETY
AUD0000001381_S0000952 AND HIS EYES KEPT ALWAYS ON THE MOVE
AUD0000001381_S0000957 AND WE WERE LEFT IN A DARKNESS THAT SEEMED
AUD0000001381_S0000963 I FELT ALL AT ONCE TO BE GIVEN A POWER OF HEARING THAT WAS FAR BEYOND THE NORMAL
AUD0000001381_S0000968 I GRIPPED AT MY CAMERA AND FLASHLIGHT AND WAITED
AUD0000001381_S0000973 THE POLICE WERE JUST AS SILENT
AUD0000001381_S0000978 I RAISED THE CAMERA AND FLASHLIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0000983 SUDDENLY ALL AROUND US THERE SOUNDED A DRIP DRIP
AUD0000001381_S0000988 AND THE GRIM QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER THE BARRIERS COULD SAVE US FROM WHATEVER HAD COME INTO THE HUGE ROOM
AUD0000001381_S0000993 THERE WAS NO OTHER SOUND
AUD0000001381_S0000998 IF YOU HAVE EVER WHEN OUT SHOOTING BROKEN A RABBIT'S NECK YOU WILL KNOW THE SOUND IN MINIATURE
AUD0000001381_S0001003 IN THE AWFUL SUCCEEDING SILENCE I POSITIVELY QUIVERED
AUD0000001381_S0001008 ONE OF THEM STEPPED ON THE ELECTRIC PENTACLE AND SMASHED IT
AUD0000001381_S0001014 THE MEN WERE A LITTLE AHEAD OF ME AND I NEVER CEASED RUNNING AND NEITHER DID THEY
AUD0000001381_S0001019 IT WAS DISGUSTING
AUD0000001381_S0001024 FORTUNATELY I HAD BROUGHT MY CAMERA AWAY FROM THE HOUSE POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE STRAP HAD HAPPENED TO BE OVER MY HEAD
AUD0000001381_S0001029 THAT THE NEGATIVES MIGHT SHOW SOMETHING
AUD0000001381_S0001037 THE RAIN HAD COMMENCED AGAIN BUT THAT DID NOT BOTHER ME
AUD0000001381_S0001043 EVERY TIME A LEAF RUSTLED I JUMPED
AUD0000001381_S0001048 I WENT ON UNTIL I COULD SEE INTO THE HALL
AUD0000001381_S0001053 IT WAS PLAIN TO ME THAT THEY WERE A GANG OF MEN WHO HAD MADE USE OF THE EMPTY MANOR PERHAPS FOR YEARS
AUD0000001381_S0001058 WHICH SEEMED CURIOUSLY QUIET AS THOUGH IT WERE HALF-DRUGGED
AUD0000001381_S0001063 AND IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS A REPETITION OF THE UNCOMFORTABLE BREAKING SOUND I HAD HEARD EARLIER IN THE NIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0001071 AND I RAN QUICKLY BACK INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE UPPER END
AUD0000001381_S0001077 WHEN THE LAST MAN HAD VANISHED THE SLAB THAT MADE THE STEP WAS SHUT DOWN
AUD0000001381_S0001083 WE ENTERED THE PARK AND THE MANOR IN THE SAME WAY THAT I HAD DONE
AUD0000001381_S0001088 AND THAT WAS WHAT I SET OUT TO DO
AUD0000001381_S0001094 PERHAPS IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT TO DIRECT THE FLUID WITHOUT POSITIVELY SQUIRTING IT WHICH MIGHT HAVE GIVEN THE WHOLE THING AWAY
AUD0000001381_S0001102 THEY HAD EVIDENTLY MADE NO PREPARATIONS FOR LIFTING THE HOOK
AUD0000001381_S0001109 YOU SEE THEY MADE THE PLACE AS DARK AS POSSIBLE FIRST
AUD0000001381_S0001114 WELL OF COURSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE SURE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
AUD0000001381_S0001120 OUT YOU GO SAID CARNACKI GENIALLY USING THE RECOGNIZED FORMULA
AUD0000001381_S0001128 BESIDES I FANCY I SHALL SEE THE THING CLEARER AFTER I HAVE TOLD IT ALL OUT STRAIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0001134 ONLY TO FIND THAT HE HAD BOUGHT A VERY PECULIAR PIECE OF PROPERTY
AUD0000001381_S0001143 WHICH HAS GOT A MOST INFERNAL WHISTLING IN IT SORT OF HAUNTING IT
AUD0000001381_S0001151 THAT PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE SOME GOOD REASON FOR PLAYING TRICKS AS ELABORATE AS THIS
AUD0000001381_S0001156 THERE'S ABOUT A SCORE OF HOT YOUNG IRISHMEN BEEN COURTING HER THESE TWO YEARS GONE
AUD0000001381_S0001162 AFTERWARD I TOLD HER ONE EVENING DURING DINNER
AUD0000001381_S0001169 WELL THE CHAPS STARTED TO BAIT ME A BIT AND OFFERED TO TAKE BETS AFTER DINNER THAT I'D NOT STAY SIX MONTHS IN THE PLACE
AUD0000001381_S0001175 I GUESS SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE HARD HIT UNLESS I LOSE WHICH I DON'T MEAN TO
AUD0000001381_S0001182 ONLY PERHAPS A BIT MORE LONESOME
AUD0000001381_S0001187 I TELL YOU EVEN AS WE DUG ALONG THE CORRIDOR IT TOOK ME A BIT IN THE THROAT IT WAS SO BEASTLY QUEER
AUD0000001381_S0001192 TOM SAID HE GOT IT THE SAME WAY SORT OF FELT STUNNED AND BEWILDERED
AUD0000001381_S0001198 WE WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND WALKED OVER IT AND THEN PAID ANOTHER VISIT TO THE ROOM BUT WE SIMPLY COULDN'T STAND IT
AUD0000001381_S0001204 AND NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK EXCEPT THAT THE SENSIBLE PART OF ME TELLS ME THAT IT'S SOME PLAN OF THESE WILD IRISHMEN TO TRY TO TAKE A RISE OUT OF ME DONE ANYTHING SINCE I ASKED HIM
AUD0000001381_S0001214 TASSOC TURNED INTO A LONG CORRIDOR AND WE FOLLOWED SHIELDING OUR CANDLES AS WE RAN
AUD0000001381_S0001220 TO STAND THERE AND LISTEN
AUD0000001381_S0001225 EVEN A LITTLE BIT
AUD0000001381_S0001231 AND IN THE YELLOW FINGER EXPERIMENTS AS WELL AS OTHER TIMES
AUD0000001381_S0001237 I SLAMMED THE DOOR AND LOCKED IT
AUD0000001381_S0001243 I WAS THE BACK MAN AND I KNOW WE ALL KEPT LOOKING OVER OUR SHOULDERS
AUD0000001381_S0001252 I FEEL THAT THERE IS SOMETHING BEASTLY AND DANGEROUS ABOUT THIS THING
AUD0000001381_S0001257 AT THE EAST END OF THE GALLERY WAS THE ENTRANCE TO THE CORRIDOR OF THE EAST WING THIS WAS SHUT OFF FROM THE GALLERY BY TWO OLD AND HEAVY OAK DOORS
AUD0000001381_S0001265 IT WAS EMPTY AND I WENT THROUGH THE DOORWAY AND PUSHED-TO THE OAK BEHIND ME
AUD0000001381_S0001270 BY WHICH I SUPPOSED THE WHISTLING MIGHT BE PRODUCED THOUGH AT THAT PERIOD OF MY INVESTIGATION I WAS QUITE PREPARED TO FIND IT DUE TO SOME PERFECTLY NATURAL CAUSE FOR IT IS ASTONISHING THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF CASES THAT PROVE TO HAVE NOTHING ABNORMAL IN THEM
AUD0000001381_S0001275 I UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND TURNED THE HANDLE
AUD0000001381_S0001280 I STOOD A FEW SECONDS WAITING AND NOTHING HAPPENED
AUD0000001381_S0001286 AND THINKS THAT IT HAS GOT YOU
AUD0000001381_S0001293 IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ME TO GROW MORE SOLID
AUD0000001381_S0001300 A LOW MOCKING WHISTLE GREW IN THE ROOM
AUD0000001381_S0001306 I HAD NO DOUBT BUT THAT I HAD COME ACROSS ONE OF THOSE RARE AND HORRIBLE CASES OF THE INANIMATE REPRODUCING THE FUNCTIONS OF THE ANIMATE
AUD0000001381_S0001312 I DASHED OUT SLAMMING THE DOOR AND LOCKING IT
AUD0000001381_S0001321 THERE IS OF COURSE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UNKNOWN LAST LINE OF THE SAAAMAAA RITUAL BEING UTTERED BUT IT IS TOO UNCERTAIN TO COUNT UPON
AUD0000001381_S0001329 EVEN THROUGH THE CLOSED DOORS
AUD0000001381_S0001335 I CAN'T SLEEP
AUD0000001381_S0001340 NO I SAID BY JOVE NO
AUD0000001381_S0001346 IN THE MORNING I WENT ALONG TO THE ROOM
AUD0000001381_S0001351 I KNEW THAT IT MIGHT VERY POSSIBLY HAVE SNAPPED THROUGH MY HAVING TENSIONED IT TOO HIGHLY BUT THEN AGAIN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROKEN BY SOMETHING ELSE
AUD0000001381_S0001357 YET OF COURSE I DID NOT TRUST TO ANY SUCH CASUAL EXAMINATION AND AFTER BREAKFAST I PUT ON MY OVERALLS
AUD0000001381_S0001363 I WENT EVEN FURTHER THEN FOR AT NIGHT WHEN THE WHISTLING COMMENCED I MADE A MICROPHONE TEST
AUD0000001381_S0001370 WELL OF COURSE IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE IF THIS WERE THE CASE
AUD0000001381_S0001375 IT WAS AS IF AN INTELLIGENCE THERE KNEW THAT STEPS WERE BEING TAKEN AGAINST IT
AUD0000001381_S0001427 IT MAKES ONE THINK SOME CURIOUS THOUGHTS DOESN'T IT
AUD0000001381_S0001434 AND HE WON HIS BETS RATHER
AUD0000001381_S0001440 AND PRESENTLY THRUST US FORTH IN FRIENDLY FASHION ON THE EMBANKMENT AND INTO THE FRESH NIGHT AIR
AUD0000001381_S0001448 AS I CAME INTO THE ROOM HE ROSE WITH A PERCEPTIBLY STIFF MOVEMENT AND EXTENDED HIS LEFT HAND
AUD0000001381_S0001453 HE WOULD TELL US ALL ABOUT IT LATER
AUD0000001381_S0001461 HER FACE WAS TURNED A LITTLE UPWARD AS IF SHE HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED SUDDENLY BY SOME NOISE
AUD0000001381_S0001466 WHEN WE HAD SPENT A QUIET HOUR AT THE TABLE WE PULLED OUR CHAIRS ROUND AND MADE OURSELVES SNUG AND CARNACKI BEGAN
AUD0000001381_S0001472 FUNNY CREATURES WE HUMANS
AUD0000001381_S0001479 YOU SEE FOR SEVEN GENERATIONS THE HISGINS FAMILY HAVE HAD MEN CHILDREN FOR THEIR FIRST-BORN AND EVEN THE HISGINSES THEMSELVES HAVE LONG CONSIDERED THE TALE TO BE LITTLE MORE THAN A MYTH
AUD0000001381_S0001485 TO PUT THE THING IN THE LEAST EMOTIONAL WAY
AUD0000001381_S0001490 ONE BY FALLING FROM A WINDOW
AUD0000001381_S0001854 HOW DID THE CAPTAIN GET IN FROM THE OTHER SIDE
AUD0000001381_S0001859 DON'T ASK ME WHO MADE THE WELL ENTRANCE OR THE LITTLE STAIRWAY FOR I DON'T KNOW
AUD0000001381_S0001868 THERE MAY BE OTHER HOUSES I BEGAN
AUD0000001381_S0001877 AND BY WHICH I WAS REQUESTED TO PRESENT MYSELF AT HIS HOUSE NOT LATER THAN SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THAT EVENING
AUD0000001381_S0001882 NOT ONE OF US EVER WILLINGLY MISSED FOR AFTER A THOROUGHLY SENSIBLE LITTLE DINNER CARNACKI WOULD SNUGGLE DOWN INTO HIS BIG ARMCHAIR
AUD0000001381_S0001888 NEVER HAVING UTTERED A WORD
AUD0000001381_S0001893 CARNACKI SNUGGED HIMSELF DOWN INTO HIS GREAT CHAIR AS I HAVE SAID WAS HIS HABIT
AUD0000001381_S0001898 A MINUTE OR SO LATER CARNACKI BEGAN TO SPEAK
AUD0000001381_S0001904 WHEN I GOT THERE I FOUND THAT THEY HAVE AN OLD CHAPEL ATTACHED TO THE CASTLE WHICH HAS HAD QUITE A DISTINGUISHED REPUTATION FOR BEING WHAT IS POPULARLY TERMED HAUNTED
AUD0000001381_S0001909 IT SOUNDS ALMOST LAUGHABLE I KNOW TO HEAR OF A LONG-RESPECTED SUPERNATURAL PHENOMENON GROWING UNEXPECTEDLY DANGEROUS AND IN THIS CASE THE TALE OF THE HAUNTING WAS CONSIDERED AS LITTLE MORE THAN AN OLD MYTH
AUD0000001381_S0001914 IT IS IN FACT THIS DAGGER WHICH IS POPULARLY SUPPOSED TO HAUNT THE CHAPEL
AUD0000001381_S0001920 I AM AS BIG A SKEPTIC CONCERNING THE TRUTH OF GHOST TALES AS ANY MAN YOU ARE LIKELY TO MEET ONLY I AM WHAT I MIGHT TERM AN UNPREJUDICED SKEPTIC
AUD0000001381_S0001925 BUT THE HUNDREDTH
AUD0000001381_S0001931 EITHER BY THE AID OF SOME INHERENT FORCE
AUD0000001381_S0001936 AND I SET TO WORK TO MAKE A PRETTY DRASTIC EXAMINATION OF THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW MOST ABOUT THE TRAGEDY
AUD0000001381_S0001941 SIR ALFRED JARNOCK'S HOUSEHOLD HAD ATTENDED FAMILY SERVICE AS USUAL IN THE CHAPEL
AUD0000001381_S0001946 WHILST OLD BELLETT THE BUTLER WENT ROUND PUTTING OUT THE CANDLES
AUD0000001381_S0001952 THAT THE OLD BUTLER WAS STABBED THERE FULL IN THE CANDLELIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES
AUD0000001381_S0001957 AND HE HAD EVIDENTLY RECEIVED THE ASTONISHMENT OF HIS LIFE
AUD0000001381_S0001963 WHEN I LEFT HIM HE WENT BACK TO THE WRITING WHICH HE HAD PUT ASIDE WHEN I APPEARED
AUD0000001381_S0001968 BUT HE COULD TELL ME NOTHING THAT DID NOT POINT TO THERE BEING A POWER ABROAD IN THE CHAPEL
AUD0000001381_S0001973 WHEN SOMETHING STRUCK HIM AN ENORMOUS BLOW HIGH UP ON THE LEFT BREAST AND HE WAS DRIVEN HEADLONG INTO THE AISLE
AUD0000001381_S0001978 THE DAGGER ITSELF BEING DRIVEN CLEAN THROUGH THE BODY AND OUT THROUGH THE SCAPULA BEHIND
AUD0000001381_S0001984 THE BUTLER HAVING NO DUPLICATE
AUD0000001381_S0001993 RATHER PECULIAR
AUD0000001381_S0002000 IN THE MEANWHILE I TREATED THE CHAPEL DRASTICALLY SOUNDING AND SCRUTINIZING THE WALLS AND FLOOR
AUD0000001381_S0002007 AND THE KEY KEPT BY SIR ALFRED JARNOCK HIMSELF AS I HAVE TOLD YOU
AUD0000001381_S0002012 FOR THE BUTLER AS YOU KNOW WAS STRUCK IN FULL SIGHT OF THE RECTOR SIR JARNOCK AND HIS SON
AUD0000001381_S0002018 I PROPOSED TO SIR ALFRED JARNOCK THAT I SHOULD SPEND A NIGHT IN THE CHAPEL
AUD0000001381_S0002023 SO THAT NO ONE MIGHT FOOLISHLY OR HEEDLESSLY RUN THE RISK OF ANY PERIL THAT IT MIGHT HOLD AT NIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0002029 I SAW HOW I MIGHT ACHIEVE THE THING I WISHED AND BE ABLE TO ENTER THE CHAPEL AFTER DARK
AUD0000001381_S0002034 IN THE MORNING I CARRIED OUT MY IDEA
AUD0000001381_S0002039 AS I WANTED TO TAKE A SECOND PHOTOGRAPH OF THE CHANCEL THAT NIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0002044 IF I WOULD CALL IN TWO HOURS
AUD0000001381_S0002049 AFTER DINNER THAT EVENING I PLAYED BILLIARDS WITH YOUNG JARNOCK FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS
AUD0000001381_S0002054 I LOCKED THE DOOR OF MY ROOM
AUD0000001381_S0002060 I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ARMOR BUT FROM WHAT I HAVE LEARNED SINCE I MUST HAVE PUT ON PARTS OF TWO SUITS
AUD0000001381_S0002065 I HAD BEEN SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME MAKING MY PREPARATIONS AND I FOUND THAT NOW THE BIG HALL AND STAIRCASE WERE IN DARKNESS AND ALL THE HOUSE SEEMED QUIET
AUD0000001381_S0002070 AND ALL ABOUT ME THE UTTER DREE SILENCE OF THE PLACE
AUD0000001381_S0002075 YOU JUST TRY ANY OF YOU TO IMAGINE YOURSELF STANDING THERE IN THE DARK SILENCE AND REMEMBERING NOT ONLY THE LEGEND THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THE PLACE
AUD0000001381_S0002080 FIRST OF ALL I SWITCHED ON MY LIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0002085 ABOVE THE ALTAR
AUD0000001381_S0002090 AND THE QUIET WAS ABOMINABLE
AUD0000001381_S0002097 THEN IN THE LIGHT FROM MY LANTERN I INSERTED THE SHUTTER INTO THE SLIDE
AUD0000001381_S0002104 THE TIME I KNEW BY THE FAR-OFF FAINT CHIME OF A CLOCK THAT HAD BEEN ERECTED OVER THE STABLES
AUD0000001381_S0002109 AND YOU KNOW SOMEHOW THE DARK ABOUT ME SEEMED TO PRESS COLDLY AGAINST MY FACE
AUD0000001381_S0002115 CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW I FELT
AUD0000001381_S0002120 TALK ABOUT FRIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0002125 AS IT MIGHT BE THE TREAD OF A MAILED HEEL UPON THE STONE OF THE AISLE
AUD0000001381_S0002130 I HELD MY FACE UP IN THE DARKNESS AND I TELL YOU
AUD0000001381_S0002136 DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR
AUD0000001381_S0002143 YOU FOLLOW ME DON'T YOU
AUD0000001381_S0002149 AS THOUGH AN ARMORED FOOT STEPPED CAUTIOUSLY
AUD0000001381_S0002155 MY REASON WAS BOUND TO SUBMIT SOMEWHAT TO MY FANCY AT SUCH A TIME
AUD0000001381_S0002160 OF THE VOID
AUD0000001381_S0002165 I FLASHED IT UP THE AISLE TO AND FRO ACROSS THE CHANCEL
AUD0000001381_S0002170 YOU KNOW THE FEELING
AUD0000001381_S0002177 I HAD GROWN LESS NERVOUSLY TENSE FOR THE FLASHING OF THE LIGHT ROUND THE PLACE HAD MADE ME FEEL LESS OUT OF BOUNDS OF THE NORMAL IT HAD GIVEN ME SOMETHING OF THAT UNREASONED SENSE OF SAFETY THAT A NERVOUS CHILD OBTAINS AT NIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0002183 AND THEN IT WAS AFTER THIS LITTLE TIME OF PARTIAL RELIEF FROM INTENSE NERVOUSNESS
AUD0000001381_S0002188 I FELT SURE THAT SOMETHING HAD MOVED AT THE TOP OF THE AISLE
AUD0000001381_S0002195 AND SUDDENLY I SEEMED TO HEAR A SOUND AGAIN
AUD0000001381_S0002200 I DO NOT THINK YOU CAN
AUD0000001381_S0002205 TO REALIZE THAT THE MUSCLES OF MY SHOULDERS ACHED
AUD0000001381_S0002211 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WORD MY FEELINGS MORE CLEARLY TO YOU FOR I CANNOT SEE THEM MORE CLEARLY THAN THIS MYSELF
AUD0000001381_S0002218 THE FEELING SEEMED TO STIFFEN ME AS I SAT
AUD0000001381_S0002258 DOES IT INTEREST YOU
AUD0000001381_S0002265 THEN KNEELING UPON THE ALTAR I REPLACED THE DAGGER IN ITS SHEATH
AUD0000001381_S0002272 AND SO GOT OUT OF THE PLACE
AUD0000001381_S0002277 THEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND GOT THE ACTING BUTLER TO GIVE ME SOME SANDWICHES AND A CUP OF COFFEE
AUD0000001381_S0002282 AND THIS HE AT ONCE PLACED AT MY DISPOSAL
AUD0000001381_S0002289 SO THAT THE WHOLE CHANCEL HAD BEEN AS IT WERE UNDER OBSERVATION
AUD0000001381_S0002294 I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA OF RESULTS NOTHING MORE THAN A VAGUE HOPE THAT IT MIGHT SHOW ME SOMETHING
AUD0000001381_S0002299 I HELD THE NEGATIVE UP TO THE LIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0002305 BUT COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT THE MARKINGS MIGHT REPRESENT
AUD0000001381_S0002310 I CARRIED DEVELOPMENT A LITTLE FURTHER THEN PUT THE NEGATIVE INTO THE HYPO
AUD0000001381_S0002316 WHILST THE TWO PLATES WERE DRYING THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND I MADE AN ENLARGEMENT FROM THE NEGATIVE I HAD TAKEN BY DAYLIGHT
AUD0000001381_S0002323 I TOOK UP THE TWO OTHER ENLARGEMENTS BOTH OF THE CHANCEL AS YOU WILL REMEMBER AND COMMENCED TO COMPARE THEM
AUD0000001381_S0002328 AFTER THIS DISCOVERY I BEGAN TO COMPARE THE TWO ENLARGEMENTS IN A VERY DIFFERENT MANNER FROM MY PREVIOUS SCRUTINY
AUD0000001381_S0002333 MAKING THEM INTO A ROLL AS I WENT
AUD0000001381_S0002338 HE ADDED ALSO THAT EVEN BEFORE THE HORRIBLE ATTACK ON THE BUTLER HIS FATHER HAD BEEN JUST AS PARTICULAR
AUD0000001381_S0002343 THESE PROVED SUCCESSFUL TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT I CAME OUT OF THE PLACE IN A PERFECT FEVER OF EXCITEMENT
AUD0000001381_S0002349 ASKING HIM TO WAIT A LITTLE
AUD0000001381_S0002355 EVIDENTLY WAITING FOR ME TO EXPLAIN
AUD0000001381_S0002361 THEN STANDING WELL AWAY ON THE RIGHT SIDE
AUD0000001381_S0002367 AND RAN BACK FROM THE CHANCEL RAIL HIS FACE VERY WHITE
AUD0000001381_S0002372 THERE
AUD0000001381_S0002378 COME AND SEE HOW IT WAS DONE I SAID
AUD0000001381_S0002384 DOWN IT WENT LEAVING THE REMAINING PART OF THE POST STANDING
AUD0000001381_S0002390 I WENT OVER NOW TO THE DUMMY AND AFTER A FEW MINUTE'S WORK MANAGED TO WRENCH THE DAGGER LOOSE OUT OF THE ARMOR
AUD0000001381_S0002395 I WITHDREW THE LEVER AND THE NARROW STRIP OF FLOOR SLID BACK COVERING POST AND DAGGER
AUD0000001381_S0002400 SO THAT IT OPENED
AUD0000001381_S0002406 THERE I SAID TURNING TO THE YOUNG MAN AND TAPPING THE DIVIDED POST
AUD0000001381_S0002411 SO IT'S PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO GET IN AND MEDDLE
AUD0000001381_S0002416 I REALIZED THEN HOW BADLY I PUT IT
AUD0000001381_S0002422 I'LL ADMIT I'VE THOUGHT FATHER A LITTLE A LITTLE STRANGE PERHAPS AT TIMES
AUD0000001381_S0002427 THERE'S NOT THE LEAST NEED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF SCANDAL ABOUT THIS
AUD0000001381_S0002432 HE CAME BACK IN ABOUT AN HOUR LOOKING RATHER UPSET
AUD0000001381_S0002437 HE HAD LEARNT OF ITS EXISTENCE FROM AN OLD MANUSCRIPT BOOK IN THE CASTLE LIBRARY
AUD0000001381_S0002443 HIS FATHER HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SETTING THE TRAP LATE EVERY NIGHT AND UNSETTING IT EACH MORNING BEFORE ANYONE ENTERED THE CHAPEL
AUD0000001383_S0000010 SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN ACCOMPANIED BY SOME SILENT DULL-EYED STUPID-LOOKING GIRL
AUD0000001383_S0000016 THE STOREKEEPERS MULCTED HER AND SHE KNEW IT AND PAID IN SILENCE
AUD0000001383_S0000021 SHE DID NOT LOOK LIKE A BAD WOMAN
AUD0000001383_S0000026 AND HER EYEGLASSES GAVE HER SOMEHOW A LOOK OF RESPECTABILITY
AUD0000001383_S0000032 SO KNOWING BLANCHE DEVINE AS WE DID
AUD0000001383_S0000037 THE FOURTH OF THE PROTESTING HUSBANDS TO ARRIVE WAS THE VERY YOUNG HUSBAND WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR TO THE CORNER COTTAGE THAT BLANCHE DEVINE HAD BOUGHT
AUD0000001383_S0000042 ALDERMAN MOONEY WAS DOWN IN THE CELLAR FOOLING WITH THE FURNACE
AUD0000001383_S0000047 HE PEERED THROUGH A HAZE OF PIPE SMOKE
AUD0000001383_S0000053 THE YOUNG HUSBAND LEANED UP AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE WATER TANK
AUD0000001383_S0000060 WELL IT'S A DARNED SHAME HE BEGAN HOTLY

AUD0000001383_S0000077 THE VERY YOUNG HUSBAND LAUGHED
AUD0000001383_S0000083 I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING I HAPPENED TO BE UP IN THE MAYOR'S OFFICE THE DAY BLANCHE SIGNED FOR THE PLACE
AUD0000001383_S0000088 WHY DOESN'T SHE GO TO ANOTHER TOWN CHICAGO OR SOMEPLACE WHERE NOBODY KNOWS HER
AUD0000001383_S0000093 SHE SAID THIS WAS HOME TO HER
AUD0000001383_S0000098 SEEMS SHE WANTS TO LIVE LIKE WELL LIKE OTHER WOMEN
AUD0000001383_S0000103 SHE'S A SMART WOMAN BLANCHE IS

AUD0000001383_S0000114 I SUPPOSE MRS MOONEY'S GOING TO CALL
AUD0000001383_S0000120 ALDERMAN MOONEY LAID A DETAINING FINGER ON HIS SLEEVE
AUD0000001383_S0000126 SAID THE VERY YOUNG HUSBAND DRYLY
AUD0000001383_S0000131 BLANCHE DEVINE USED TO COME AND WATCH THEM NOW AND THEN AS THE WORK PROGRESSED
AUD0000001383_S0000136 ON THE DAY THAT BLANCHE DEVINE MOVED IN THERE WAS WILD AGITATION AMONG THE WHITE-RUFFED BEDROOM CURTAINS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AUD0000001383_S0000141 DIRECTED THE MOVING WRAPPED IN HER GREAT FUR COAT BUT ON THE THIRD MORNING WE GASPED WHEN SHE APPEARED OUT-OF-DOORS
AUD0000001383_S0000146 MOUNTED IT CAUTIOUSLY
AUD0000001383_S0000151 LEANING PERILOUSLY SIDEWAYS ON THE LADDER TO DETECT ELUSIVE STREAKS
AUD0000001383_S0000156 SHE USED TO COME HOME LADEN WITH LITTLE BUNDLES AND BEFORE SUPPER SHE WOULD CHANGE HER STREET CLOTHES FOR A NEAT WASHABLE HOUSEDRESS
AUD0000001383_S0000161 IT TAKES A DETERMINED WOMAN TO MAKE TEA BISCUIT FOR NO ONE BUT HERSELF
AUD0000001383_S0000166 THE WOMAN NEXT TO WHOM THEY SEATED HER TURNED
AUD0000001383_S0000171 SHE ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DOOR PLEASANTLY HOLDING IT WELL OPEN UNTIL HE WAS DOWN THE LITTLE FLIGHT OF STEPS AND ON THE SIDEWALK
AUD0000001383_S0000176 THEY SAID IT WAS DISGUSTING AND PERHAPS IT WAS BUT THE HABIT OF YEARS IS NOT EASILY OVERCOME
AUD0000001383_S0000182 BUT WE DID NOT

AUD0000001383_S0000198 TO SEAT HERSELF ON THE NEW FRONT PORCH FOR ALL THE WORLD TO STARE AT BUT SHE DID SIT THERE RESOLUTELY WATCHING US IN SILENCE
AUD0000001383_S0000203 HER LITTLE HOUSE WAS A MIRACLE OF CLEANLINESS
AUD0000001383_S0000208 OFTEN USED TO PEER THROUGH THE PICKETS
AUD0000001383_S0000216 SAW THE EAGER GOLDEN HEAD
AUD0000001383_S0000221 BLANCHE DEVINE HESITATED A MOMENT
AUD0000001383_S0000226 WITH A WALNUT MEAT PERCHED ATOP OF EACH
AUD0000001383_S0000231 SNOOKY
AUD0000001383_S0000238 SNOOKY DO YOU HEAR ME
AUD0000001383_S0000243 BLANCHE DEVINE STOOD THERE AT THE FENCE HOLDING THE SAUCER IN HER HAND
AUD0000001383_S0000248 THE LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE WOULD BE EMPTY FOR WEEKS
AUD0000001383_S0000253 SHE SEEMED TO PUT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY INTO THOSE CLEANINGS AS IF THEY WERE A SORT OF SAFETY VALVE
AUD0000001383_S0000259 BLANCHE DEVINE SITTING BEFORE HER DYING FIRE HALF ASLEEP STARTED AND CRINGED WHEN SHE HEARD IT
AUD0000001383_S0000264 SO SHE STARTED FORWARD NOW QUIVERING
AUD0000001383_S0000269 SHE SEIZED BLANCHE DEVINE'S ARM WITH BOTH HER FRENZIED HANDS AND SHOOK HER
AUD0000001383_S0000274 BLANCHE DEVINE SHUT THE DOOR AND SHOOK THE YOUNG WIFE SMARTLY BY THE SHOULDERS
AUD0000001383_S0000280 FOR GOD'S SAKE BLANCHE DEVINE GRASPED THE YOUNG WIFE'S ARM
AUD0000001383_S0000285 CROUP
AUD0000001383_S0000290 MADE UP OF THE HALF-FAINTING YOUNG WIFE AND THE TERRIFIED AND AWKWARD HIRED GIRL
AUD0000001383_S0000297 IF THAT DON'T DO IT WE'LL RAISE AN UMBRELLA OVER HER AND THROW A SHEET OVER AND HOLD THE KETTLE UNDER TILL THE STEAM GETS TO HER THAT WAY
AUD0000001383_S0000302 AND THE FIGHT WENT ON
AUD0000001383_S0000307 THEN SHE TUCKED A COVER AT THE SIDE OF THE BED
AUD0000001383_S0000313 SAID BLANCHE DEVINE SIMPLY

AUD0000001383_S0000334 HER STOUT FIGURE LOOMING GROTESQUE IN WALL SHADOWS SAT BLANCHE DEVINE PRETENDING TO READ
AUD0000001383_S0000339 SHE WATCHED THE HOUSE NOW WITH A SORT OF PROPRIETARY EYE
AUD0000001383_S0000344 AND TO HAVE CALLED SUCH A WOMAN
AUD0000001383_S0000349 SHE WENT BY RATHER WHITE-FACED WITHOUT A LOOK OR A WORD OR A SIGN
AUD0000001383_S0000354 THEN SHE SMILED IF HAVING ONE'S LIPS CURL AWAY FROM ONE'S TEETH CAN BE CALLED SMILING

AUD0000001383_S0000481 AT INTERVALS HE WOULD WAKE RED-EYED TO A SNATCH OF CONVERSATION SUCH AS
AUD0000001383_S0000487 THE KIND OF MAN WHO CAN LEAN UP AGAINST A MANTEL OR PROPOSE A TOAST
AUD0000001383_S0000494 THERE WAS MUSIC THE SOFT SHEEN OF SATIN LAUGHTER
AUD0000001383_S0000499 A PERSON WOULD THINK YOU WERE FIFTY INSTEAD OF THIRTY
AUD0000001383_S0000504 JO CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN DID HIS BEST TO MAKE AMENDS
AUD0000001383_S0000509 OR EVEN EVA A STAID GUEST OF THE OLD-GIRL TYPE
AUD0000001383_S0000514 IF YOU HAD SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT SOME OF HIS SISTERS' POPULARITY WAS DUE TO HIS OWN PRESENCE
AUD0000001383_S0000519 DRAB-LOOKING WOMEN IN THE LATE THIRTIES
AUD0000001383_S0000524 THIS EMILY PERSON WAS VERY SMALL AND FLUFFY
AUD0000001383_S0000529 BUT HAD THE MIRACULOUS EFFECT SOMEHOW OF LOOKING GOLDEN
AUD0000001383_S0000535 AS DOES A BABY'S UNEXPECTED CLUTCH ON YOUR PATRONIZING FOREFINGER
AUD0000001383_S0000540 IT WAS HIS HEART
AUD0000001383_S0000545 ARE YOU A SCHOOLTEACHER EMILY HE SAID
AUD0000001383_S0000550 WHICH HE HADN'T MEANT TO SAY AT ALL
AUD0000001383_S0000555 WHY DON'T YOU FEED HER
AUD0000001383_S0000560 AND FROM THAT SUNDAY NIGHT HE BEGAN TO STRAIN AT THE LEASH
AUD0000001383_S0000566 HE ONLY KNEW HE WAS MISERABLE AND YET HAPPY
AUD0000001383_S0000571 AND EVERYTHING THAT EMILY DESIRED
AUD0000001383_S0000576 HE STARED AT THE MAN WITH WHOM HE WAS DEALING UNTIL THAT STARTLED PERSON GREW UNCOMFORTABLE
AUD0000001383_S0000581 AND THEN NO GHOST
AUD0000001383_S0000586 BUT HE WAS NOT THAT KIND OF BUSINESSMAN
AUD0000001383_S0000591 BUT IF YOU'LL WAIT
AUD0000001383_S0000596 SHE WENT ABOUT IT AS IF SHE WERE ALREADY A LITTLE MATCHMAKING MATRON
AUD0000001383_S0000603 AND THREE YEARS WENT BY
AUD0000001383_S0000609 HER CRINKLINESS BEGAN TO IRON OUT
AUD0000001383_S0000614 BUT MAYBE AFTER A WHILE NO DREAMS OF SALONS AND BROCADE AND VELVET-FOOTED SERVITORS AND SATIN DAMASK NOW
AUD0000001383_S0000619 ESPECIALLY DID SHE KNOW EVA AND CARRIE AND BABE
AUD0000001383_S0000624 SHE WAS THAT KIND OF WOMAN
AUD0000001383_S0000630 HIS SILENCE WAS MISERABLE ASSENT THEN
AUD0000001383_S0000637 THEN THEY BOTH SHUT THEIR EYES WITH A LITTLE SHUDDER AS THOUGH WHAT THEY SAW WAS TERRIBLE TO LOOK UPON
AUD0000001383_S0000643 THAT BEING SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE WAS SOMETHING GRIMLY HUMOROUS IN THE TREND TAKEN BY AFFAIRS IN THE OLD HOUSE ON CALUMET
AUD0000001383_S0000648 AIDED BY PRESSING ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE TAILOR IN THE BASEMENT OVER ON THIRTY-FIRST STREET
AUD0000001383_S0000657 ALL THROUGH CHICAGO'S SOUTH SIDE
AUD0000001383_S0000662 UPON THE LITTLE HOUSEHOLD SHE BESTOWED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GRIM CAPABLE ATTENTION
AUD0000001383_S0000667 OR A SACK OF POTATOES OR FIFTY POUNDS OF SUGAR
AUD0000001383_S0000672 AND HER EYES ALIGHT WITH RESOLVE

AUD0000001383_S0000807 SHE MOPPED HER EYES SOBS SHOOK HER

AUD0000001417_S0000043 AND I HAVE ACCUMULATED A VAST AND FANTASTIC VARIETY OF SPECIMENS EVER SINCE IN MY AUDACIOUS YOUTH
AUD0000001417_S0000064 AND HE HAD OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK DREAMILY
AUD0000001417_S0000072 JUST AS I WAS A FAILURE AT ONE THING HE IS A SUCCESS AT EVERYTHING

AUD0000001417_S0000122 BUT THE READER MUST IMAGINE THE SCENE
AUD0000001417_S0000128 BUT BY NO MEANS AN ENTHUSIASTIC ONE
AUD0000001417_S0000168 HE STRODE TO THE FRONT DOOR AND LOOKED OUT
AUD0000001417_S0000173 WHENEVER BUT EVEN AS SHE SPOKE HER SPEECH WAS CLOVEN BY ANOTHER HOARSE PROCLAMATION FROM THE DARK STREET AGAIN HORRIBLY ARTICULATE
AUD0000001417_S0000180 AND HE WAS IN TIME IN TIME TO SEE SOMETHING WHICH AT FIRST GLANCE FROZE THE BLOOD
AUD0000001417_S0000185 AND MAJOR BROWN TURNED TO THE LADY
AUD0000001417_S0000190 IS THIS THE WAY REPLIED BROWN
AUD0000001417_S0000195 A PAIR OF GREAT SLIMY HANDS CAME OUT OF THE DARKNESS
AUD0000001417_S0000200 BUT THE MAJOR'S HEAD
AUD0000001417_S0000205 AND GRIPPING THE LEG BY A MUSCLE PULLED IT OFF THE GROUND AND LAID THE HUGE LIVING MAN WITH A CRASH
AUD0000001417_S0000210 BIG AS THE MAN WAS HE HAD EVIDENTLY NOW NO DESIRE BUT TO ESCAPE HE MADE SPRAWLS HITHER AND THITHER TO GET PAST THE MAJOR TO THE DOOR
AUD0000001417_S0000215 LEAVING THE TORN COAT IN THE MAJOR'S HAND THE ONLY FRUIT OF HIS ADVENTURE AND THE ONLY CLUE TO THE MYSTERY
AUD0000001417_S0000220 THE LADY WAS IN THE CONSPIRACY OF COURSE SAID RUPERT NODDING

AUD0000001417_S0000249 I DON'T THINK IT'S THE SORT OF LETTER ONE CRIMINAL WOULD WRITE TO ANOTHER
AUD0000001417_S0000255 BASIL GRANT SHOOK ALL OVER WITH A SORT OF SILENT LAUGHTER BUT DID NOT OTHERWISE MOVE
AUD0000001417_S0000261 FACTS MURMURED BASIL
AUD0000001417_S0000268 IT'S ONLY THE LIFE OF THE TREE THAT HAS UNITY AND GOES UP ONLY THE GREEN BLOOD THAT SPRINGS LIKE A FOUNTAIN AT THE STARS

AUD0000001417_S0000298 AND HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS FOREHEAD
AUD0000001417_S0000303 AT LEAST TENTATIVELY
AUD0000001417_S0000310 I SCARCELY EVER HE SAID WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS AND COLOSSAL ARROGANCE

AUD0000001417_S0000802 HE ALSO DID NOT SEEM TO BE GREATLY ENJOYING THE INTELLECTUAL BANQUET WITHIN
AUD0000001417_S0000808 TURNING TO SIR WALTER CHOLMONDELIEGH HE SAID I WAS SENT BY LADY BEAUMONT TO EXPRESS HER HOPE THAT YOU WERE NOT GOING YET SIR WALTER
AUD0000001417_S0000813 HE FOLLOWED THE YOUNG MAN BACK INTO THE SALON
AUD0000001417_S0000819 AT THIS MOMENT ANOTHER ROAR OF LAUGHTER CAME FROM WITHIN

AUD0000001417_S0000832 WHO GAZED AT HIM WITH GREAT VIOLET EYES AND WITH THE INTENSE AND AWFUL THIRST OF THE FEMALE UPPER CLASS FOR VERBAL AMUSEMENT AND STIMULUS
AUD0000001417_S0000838 WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND MR WIMPOLE SAID MURIEL BEAUMONT EAGERLY
AUD0000001417_S0000843 IF I HAD THOUGHT OF ANYTHING SO FUTILE I SHOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP MY COUNTENANCE

AUD0000001417_S0001257 THE PHRASE IS A FINE ONE
AUD0000001417_S0001262 A GREEN UMBRELLA
AUD0000001417_S0001267 TIED UP IN WISPS OF STRING OR STRAW
AUD0000001417_S0001273 HIS HAIR INDEED WAS QUITE GREY
AUD0000001417_S0001279 LASTLY
AUD0000001417_S0001285 HE HAD JUST LEFT THE ROOM IN WHICH I SAT WITH BASIL GRANT AND HIS BROTHER RUPERT
AUD0000001417_S0001291 A SOMEWHAT EXTRAVAGANT SCEPTICISM
AUD0000001417_S0001296 I COULD SWALLOW A GOOD DEAL BEING NATURALLY OF A SIMPLE TURN
AUD0000001417_S0001302 HE TELLS THE TRUTH IN TOO EXACT AND BALD A STYLE HE IS TOO VERACIOUS
AUD0000001417_S0001307 AND OF LIVING IN ODD PLACES
AUD0000001417_S0001312 SO FAR FROM PARADOX SAID HIS BROTHER WITH SOMETHING RATHER LIKE A SNEER
AUD0000001417_S0001317 WELL YOUR LIEUTENANT'S TRUTH IS STRANGER IF IT IS TRUTH
AUD0000001417_S0001324 I SHOULD LIKE TO QUESTION A REGIMENT OF HIS LANDLADIES SAID RUPERT CYNICALLY
AUD0000001417_S0001329 RUPERT AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN AN IRONICAL SILENCE
AUD0000001417_S0001336 IN A RATHER ABRUPT WAY
AUD0000001417_S0001341 RECEIVER OF STOLEN GOODS PERHAPS
AUD0000001417_S0001347 DO YOU KNOW MR KEITH I THINK I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO GO WITH YOU
AUD0000001417_S0001353 OH IN GOD'S NAME COME TO MY HOUSE-AGENT'S
AUD0000001417_S0001361 THE UNMISTAKABLE UNREST ANNOYANCE AND NERVOUSNESS OF THE MAN WITH WHOM HE WALKED
AUD0000001417_S0001366 AS THE STREETS GREW CLOSER AND MORE CROOKED AND THE ROOFS LOWER AND THE GUTTERS GROSSER WITH MUD
AUD0000001417_S0001371 WE CAME SUDDENLY TO A HALT
AUD0000001417_S0001376 HOUSE-AGENT
AUD0000001417_S0001381 HE MADE THE SAME GESTURE OF SAVAGE SURRENDER
AUD0000001417_S0001386 FROGLIKE JAWS
AUD0000001417_S0001392 WE STOOD INSIDE THE ROOM FOR FULLY FORTY SECONDS AND THE ODD OLD GENTLEMAN DID NOT LOOK AT US
AUD0000001417_S0001397 IT WAS A FERRET
AUD0000001417_S0001402 PICKED UP THE FERRET BY THE NECK
AUD0000001417_S0001408 THE ONLY MAN PRESENT THAT HE KNEW
AUD0000001417_S0001414 THAT LIEUTENANT KEITH WANTS TO SPEAK TO YOU
AUD0000001417_S0001420 IT'S ALL READY SIR
AUD0000001417_S0001428 THAT ELEVATION
AUD0000001417_S0001434 THAT MR MONTMORENCY HAS SOMETHING FURTHER TO SAY TO YOU LIEUTENANT
AUD0000001417_S0001439 WHAT ABOUT THE BIRDS
AUD0000001417_S0001444 SUDDENLY LIFTED HIS LEONINE HEAD
AUD0000001417_S0001449 THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU CRIED THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE HOUSE-AGENT
AUD0000001417_S0001456 EXPLODED WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE LAUGH AND SWUNG ROUND TO FACE US
AUD0000001417_S0001461 OF COURSE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE VISITED YOU'LL PAINT THE HOUSE GREEN BUT GREEN SHOUTED KEITH GREEN
AUD0000001417_S0001466 YOUR CLIENT LIEUTENANT KEITH APPEARS SOMEWHAT EXCITED HE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0001472 IT MUST BE RATHER GREEN
AUD0000001417_S0001478 ONLY TO BE INCONSPICUOUS RUPERT HAD HIS RUTHLESS SMILE
AUD0000001417_S0001484 RISING SLOWLY AND YET IN SUCH A WAY AS TO SUGGEST A SUDDEN SITUATION
AUD0000001417_S0001490 WHO SEEMED FOR THE SECOND STAGGERED
AUD0000001417_S0001495 SAID THE HOUSE-AGENT
AUD0000001417_S0001501 THE DULL STARLIT STREET WAS DESERTED
AUD0000001417_S0001506 TO ALL APPEARANCE MERELY DULL
AUD0000001417_S0001511 THE CROWD WAS STIRRING VERY SLIGHTLY
AUD0000001417_S0001516 AND ONCE THERE WE SOON LEARNED THE NATURE OF THE DIFFICULTY
AUD0000001417_S0001521 ONE OF THE FOUR SURVIVORS OF THE BRUTAL AND PERHAPS FATAL SCUFFLE WAS THE IMMACULATE LIEUTENANT KEITH
AUD0000001417_S0001526 POINTED AT HIM IN A WORSE MANNER
AUD0000001417_S0001531 AND EVEN AS THEY DID SO RUPERT GRANT SPRANG FORWARD WITH HIS INCONTROLLABLE AND INTOLERABLE SECRET
AUD0000001417_S0001536 I SHALL ONLY BE ABLE TO TAKE THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF THE MEN IN THE SCUFFLE AND HAVE A GOOD EYE KEPT ON THEM
AUD0000001417_S0001543 HE STILL FOUND HOWEVER ONE EAGER-FACED STRANGER LINGERING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE AFFAIR
AUD0000001417_S0001548 MY NAME IS RUPERT GRANT SAID THAT INDIVIDUAL WITH SOME POMP
AUD0000001417_S0001553 HIS ADDRESS IS THE ELMS BUXTON COMMON
AUD0000001417_S0001558 RUPERT GRANT GENERALLY CAME DOWN LATE IN A RATHER LORDLY WAY TO BREAKFAST HE CONTRIVED I DON'T KNOW HOW
AUD0000001417_S0001563 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOUR DRUMMOND KEITH NOW
AUD0000001417_S0001568 BUTTERING HIS TOAST WITH AN ENERGY THAT WAS SOMEWHAT EXULTANT
AUD0000001417_S0001574 I MEANT THAT I DID NOT THINK ABOUT HIM THAT HE DID NOT OCCUPY MY MIND
AUD0000001417_S0001579 BREAKING AN EGG WITH UNNECESSARY SHARPNESS
AUD0000001417_S0001584 AND IF EVER TWO HUMAN BEINGS WERE PLOTTING TOGETHER AND LYING TO EVERY ONE ELSE HE AND THAT IMPOSSIBLE HOUSE-AGENT WERE DOING IT
AUD0000001417_S0001589 IF THIS IS BEING GLARINGLY GOOD
AUD0000001417_S0001594 HE IS VERY FOND OF CHANGE AND EXPERIMENT
AUD0000001417_S0001599 ANY MAN MIGHT
AUD0000001417_S0001604 IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID THE LANDLADY WITH AN ALARMED AIR THERE'S A POLICEMAN WANTS TO SEE YOU
AUD0000001417_S0001609 WAS PRESENT AT THE AFFAIR IN COPPER STREET LAST NIGHT AND DREW MY ATTENTION VERY STRONGLY TO A PARTICULAR MAN
AUD0000001417_S0001614 GAVE HIS NAME AS DRUMMOND KEITH
AUD0000001417_S0001620 IT WASN'T SERIOUS ENOUGH TO DO MORE THAN THAT
AUD0000001417_S0001625 IT'S CERTAINLY VERY EXTRAORDINARY
AUD0000001417_S0001631 A DOUBTFUL ACQUAINTANCE ROWDY STORIES
AUD0000001417_S0001636 AND HE STROLLED MOODILY ABOUT THE ROOM
AUD0000001417_S0001641 AND OUR PEOPLE WERE DOWN THERE THIS MORNING BEFORE ANY OF YOU WERE AWAKE
AUD0000001417_S0001646 HE WAS A CLEVER RASCAL
AUD0000001417_S0001652 HE WAS CORNERED ALMOST FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I HAD KNOWN HIM AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I RATHER WONDERED AT THE ALMOST CHILDISH OBSTINACY WHICH KEPT HIM SO CLOSE TO HIS ORIGINAL PREJUDICE IN FAVOUR OF THE WILDLY QUESTIONABLE LIEUTENANT
AUD0000001417_S0001657 STRUCK IN WITH THE SHARP AND SUAVE VOICE HE LOVED SO MUCH TO USE
AUD0000001417_S0001662 LOOKING SWEETLY AT THE CEILING
AUD0000001417_S0001667 THEN HIS HEAD FELL BACK IN HIS CHAIR SO SUDDENLY THAT I STARTED UP THINKING HIM ILL
AUD0000001417_S0001675 BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT MUCH TIME TO LOSE IF WE'RE TO GET DOWN TO THAT PLACE
AUD0000001417_S0001681 PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AS HE ROSE
AUD0000001417_S0001687 WHY SHOULDN'T I GO TO BUXTON COMMON
AUD0000001417_S0001694 AND IN ORDER TO FIND HIM HE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0001761 PUFFING HIS CIGAR
AUD0000001417_S0001766 THE MADDEST THING IS THE MOST LIKELY
AUD0000001417_S0001772 WE DRANK
AUD0000001417_S0001783 HE WOULD TALK TO ANY ONE ANYWHERE AND TALK NOT ONLY WELL BUT WITH PERFECTLY GENUINE CONCERN AND ENTHUSIASM FOR THAT PERSON'S AFFAIRS
AUD0000001417_S0001789 BUT THERE WAS AN ACCIDENTAL LOOK ABOUT ALL OF THEM AS IF THEY WERE WINDFALLS
AUD0000001417_S0001794 IN ALL REASONABLE CERTAINTY PRECISELY LIKE EVERY OTHER DENTIST FROM FULHAM
AUD0000001417_S0001801 I HAD MET GRANT WHILE HE WAS STILL A JUDGE
AUD0000001417_S0001808 HE WAS KNOWN TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF HART STREET BLOOMSBURY
AUD0000001417_S0001815 THERE HE LIVED WITH THREE SISTERS
AUD0000001417_S0001820 HIS ONLY HOURS OF EXHILARATION OCCURRED WHEN HIS FRIEND BASIL GRANT
AUD0000001417_S0001825 HAD MOODS OF BOISTEROUS BABYISHNESS AND THESE SEEMED FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER TO DESCEND UPON HIM PARTICULARLY IN THE HOUSE OF HIS STUDIOUS AND ALMOST DINGY FRIEND
AUD0000001417_S0001839 BUT HIS SPEECH WAS INTERRUPTED
AUD0000001417_S0001844 BUT PRACTICAL LIFE AS A WEIRD AND UNNERVING VISION
AUD0000001417_S0001850 I BELIEVE IT'S TRUE SHE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0001857 BUT I BELIEVE IT IS PRACTICALLY SETTLED
AUD0000001417_S0001862 I'VE KNOWN MEN AND GOOD MEN LIKE YOUR BROTHER
AUD0000001417_S0001868 YOUR ARGUMENT WAS IN THREE POINTS FALLACIOUS
AUD0000001417_S0001873 HE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0001878 IS THAT IT DOES NOT MERELY PRESUPPOSE A ZULU TRUTH APART FROM THE FACTS
AUD0000001417_S0001884 POSSIBLY NOT
AUD0000001417_S0001890 GRANT IN PARTICULAR SEEMED SO DREAMY AT TABLE THAT HE SCARCELY SAW THE PILE OF LETTERS BY HIS PLATE
AUD0000001417_S0001895 THOUGH HE SAID NOTHING AND DID NOT MOVE
AUD0000001417_S0001900 AND FLATTENED OUT THE WIRE IN FRONT OF ME
AUD0000001417_S0001906 YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID GRANT COMPOSEDLY
AUD0000001417_S0001911 THESE THINGS ARE TRUISMS AND OFTEN PRIVATE ONES AT THAT
AUD0000001417_S0001917 THROUGH TRAFALGAR SQUARE
AUD0000001417_S0001922 IS IT SO VERY EXTRAORDINARY OR COMPLICATED THAT A DREAMY SOMNAMBULANT OLD INVALID WHO HAS ALWAYS WALKED ON THE BORDERS OF THE INCONCEIVABLE SHOULD GO MAD UNDER THE SHOCK OF GREAT JOY
AUD0000001417_S0001927 THAT WAS NOT THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE TO WHICH I REFERRED
AUD0000001417_S0001932 THE TALL AND ANGULAR FIGURE OF THE ELDEST MISS CHADD BLOCKED THE DOORWAY AS THE DOOR OPENED
AUD0000001417_S0001937 SIT DOWN WON'T YOU SAID ONE OF THEM IN A VOICE THAT WAS SOMEWHAT RIGID WITH PAIN
AUD0000001417_S0001943 MY SISTERS WERE BOTH SOMEWHAT UNWELL AND HAD NOT COME DOWN
AUD0000001417_S0001948 WERE YOU LOOKING FOR ANYTHING I COULD GET HE DID NOT ANSWER
AUD0000001417_S0001953 I REALLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE THE SENSATION WHICH I THEN HAD
AUD0000001417_S0001958 JAMES WAS STANDING ON ONE LEG
AUD0000001417_S0001964 I ASKED HIM IF HIS LEG HURT HIM
AUD0000001417_S0001970 JAMES GAVE THREE KICKS IN THE AIR WITH THE RIGHT LEG FLUNG UP THE OTHER
AUD0000001417_S0001976 AND THEN HIS ONLY REPLY WAS TO LIFT HIS LEFT FOOT SLOWLY FROM THE FLOOR AND DESCRIBE CIRCLES WITH IT IN THE AIR
AUD0000001417_S0001981 IT LOOKS AS IF HIS LEGS BELONGED TO SOME ONE ELSE OR WERE POSSESSED BY DEVILS
AUD0000001417_S0001986 SAID MISS CHADD CALMLY
AUD0000001417_S0001991 IT WAS A SMALL AND SOMEWHAT SMUG SUBURBAN GARDEN THE FLOWER BEDS A LITTLE TOO NEAT AND LIKE THE PATTERN OF A COLOURED CARPET BUT ON THIS SHINING AND OPULENT SUMMER DAY EVEN THEY HAD THE EXUBERANCE OF SOMETHING NATURAL
AUD0000001417_S0002027 IN THE ASIATIC MANUSCRIPT DEPARTMENT AT EIGHT HUNDRED A YEAR
AUD0000001417_S0002033 THAT HE OUGHT TO TAKE ON THE ASIATIC MANUSCRIPTS
AUD0000001417_S0002039 DO YOU ASK US TO GIVE THIS OBVIOUS LUNATIC NEARLY A THOUSAND A YEAR FOR LIFE
AUD0000001417_S0002047 NO SAID BASIL BEAMING
AUD0000001417_S0002052 COME MR GRANT HE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0002058 BUT ACTUALLY TO STOP WITH THE ABSURD DANCING
AUD0000001417_S0002063 IT MAY BE YOUR SINCERE VIEW IN WHICH CASE I ASK YOUR PARDON FOR THE FORMER SUGGESTION
AUD0000001417_S0002068 AND IF THE ARCHANGEL GABRIEL WENT MAD IT WOULD SEVER HIS CONNECTION I AM SORRY TO SAY WITH THE BRITISH MUSEUM LIBRARY
AUD0000001417_S0002076 BUT IN PASSING OUT OF IT FOUND IT BLOCKED
AUD0000001417_S0002082 I WAS AFRAID SO HE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0002089 HOMICIDAL MANIA HE BEGAN NO NO SAID THE MEDICAL MAN IMPATIENTLY
AUD0000001417_S0002094 NOT MAD
AUD0000001417_S0002099 I'M PAID TO JUDGE OF LUNATICS BUT NOT OF FOOLS
AUD0000001417_S0002105 LIKE A STEEL BELL I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY HE SAID TO GIVE HIM ANY MESSAGE YOU LIKE TO SEND
AUD0000001417_S0002110 BUT BINGHAM CRIED OF COURSE OF COURSE WITH A SORT OF FRENZY
AUD0000001417_S0002115 AND THEN STOOD ON ONE LEG
AUD0000001417_S0002121 ANYTHING PAINFUL OF COURSE HE BEGAN
AUD0000001417_S0002127 THE FACE OF A MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE BURNED HERETICS
AUD0000001417_S0002132 WHAT HAS THIS GLORIOUS BIGOT DONE
AUD0000001417_S0002158 WITH THE PLACIDITY WHICH HE ASSOCIATED WITH HIS PROFESSION
AUD0000001417_S0002163 DONE
AUD0000001417_S0002168 I BELIEVE RUPERT REALLY BELIEVED THAT THE MILKMAN WAS A FAIRY FOR A SECOND HE SEEMED TO ACCEPT HIM AS HAVING VANISHED
AUD0000001417_S0002173 LEANING AGAINST A LAMP-POST IN THE LONELY STREET
AUD0000001417_S0002178 DENOTING EXCITEMENT
AUD0000001417_S0002183 HIS FACE FELL
AUD0000001417_S0002190 JUST SAID
AUD0000001417_S0002195 YOU OWN HE SAID NOTHING AND DID NOTHING WORTH MENTIONING
AUD0000001417_S0002201 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE MILKMAN DID NOT BETRAY HIMSELF
AUD0000001417_S0002207 SAID RUPERT COOLLY
AUD0000001417_S0002212 AS I PROPOUNDED THEM
AUD0000001417_S0002217 YOU JUST COME WITH ME
AUD0000001417_S0002222 THE RIDICULOUS WELL IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF
AUD0000001417_S0002229 HIS AIR WAS SO DEFINITE THAT I PAUSED AND EVEN INCLINED MY HEAD FOR A MOMENT TOWARDS IT
AUD0000001417_S0002235 NO OF COURSE NOT I REPLIED THEN I RECOMMEND YOU TO LISTEN SAID RUPERT SHARPLY
AUD0000001417_S0002240 WAS COMING A CONTINUOUS AND MOANING SOUND WHICH TOOK THE FORM OF THE WORDS WHEN SHALL I GET OUT WHEN SHALL I GET OUT
AUD0000001417_S0002245 INSTEAD OF BEING IN SOME SMALL SENSE THE DETECTIVE
AUD0000001417_S0002252 BUT WHEN I HEAR A HUMAN BEING WAILING THAT SHE CAN'T GET OUT
AUD0000001417_S0002258 WHAT IS TO BE DONE
AUD0000001417_S0002263 LEAVING A GAP AND GLIMPSE OF THE DARK WINDOW-PANE INSIDE
AUD0000001417_S0002269 TWO LARGE DIM HUMAN EYES WERE SO CLOSE TO US THAT THE WINDOW ITSELF SEEMED SUDDENLY TO BE A MASK
AUD0000001417_S0002274 BUT LIFTING HIS WALKING-STICK AND POINTING THE FERRULE LIKE A FENCING SWORD AT THE GLASS
AUD0000001417_S0002279 MAKING THE SAME DEMAND FOR LIBERTY
AUD0000001417_S0002284 THEY WON'T LET ME
AUD0000001417_S0002289 INCENSED WITH THIS VERY SINISTER MYSTERY
AUD0000001417_S0002296 FOR A FIGURE ALMOST AS MOTIONLESS AS THE PILLARS OF THE PORTICO BUT UNMISTAKABLY HUMAN
AUD0000001417_S0002301 THAT HE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY STARING AT US
AUD0000001417_S0002306 I ALMOST THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY A STATUE
AUD0000001417_S0002313 VERY SAD VERY SAD THE INDIFFERENCE OF THESE PEOPLE
AUD0000001417_S0002318 SLAPPING HIS GLOVES TOGETHER WHEN WE GOT INTO THE STREET
AUD0000001417_S0002324 HE IS QUITE NEAR AS I PROMISED TO MEET HIM AT GLOUCESTER ROAD STATION
AUD0000001417_S0002329 AFTER A LITTLE LOOKING ABOUT WE DISCOVERED BASIL GRANT WITH HIS GREAT HEAD AND HIS GREAT WHITE HAT BLOCKING THE TICKET-OFFICE WINDOW
AUD0000001417_S0002334 WHICH HAD BEEN WELL TYPIFIED BY SOME OF THE OFFICIAL'S INGENIOUS BUT PERVERSE FALLACIES
AUD0000001417_S0002339 WHILE WE TOLD HIM IN A RATHER FEVERISH DUET OF THE GREAT HOUSE IN SOUTH KENSINGTON
AUD0000001417_S0002345 TO GO TWICE ON THE SAME PRETEXT WOULD LOOK DUBIOUS
AUD0000001417_S0002352 IT STOOD UP PONDEROUS AND PURPLE AGAINST THE LAST PALLOR OF TWILIGHT
AUD0000001417_S0002357 TO GO INTO THAT PLACE ALONE
AUD0000001417_S0002362 AND HE WENT UP THE STEPS AND RANG AT THE BELL
AUD0000001417_S0002367 IT HAD BEEN LIKE THE HEAVY GAPING AND CLOSING OF THE DIM LIPS OF SOME EVIL LEVIATHAN
AUD0000001417_S0002373 SUDDENLY RUPERT MADE AN ABRUPT MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE HOUSE
AUD0000001417_S0002378 HE WAS ROARING WITH LAUGHTER AND TALKING SO LOUDLY THAT YOU COULD HAVE HEARD EVERY SYLLABLE ACROSS THE STREET
AUD0000001417_S0002384 BUT I MUST REALLY BE OFF
AUD0000001417_S0002390 BEFORE THE DOOR CLOSED
AUD0000001417_S0002395 WHAT IS TO BE DONE BASIL
AUD0000001417_S0002400 WE STARED BLANKLY
AUD0000001417_S0002405 HAVE YOU TURNED PURITAN OR PASSIVE RESISTER OR SOMETHING
AUD0000001417_S0002412 OH THAT HE SAID I'D FORGOTTEN THAT
AUD0000001417_S0002419 HOW CAN IT BE A MERE PRIVATE AFFAIR
AUD0000001417_S0002424 THAT'S VERY FORCIBLE HE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0002430 THOSE TWO FELLOWS NEVER COMMITTED A CRIME IN THEIR LIVES
AUD0000001417_S0002436 GOOD MEN DO COMMIT CRIMES SOMETIMES SAID BASIL
AUD0000001417_S0002443 BASIL I SAID TAKING HIM FIRMLY BY THE SHOULDER
AUD0000001417_S0002449 OF COURSE IF YOU FEEL LIKE THAT HE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0002454 ETHICS OF EVOLUTION AND ALL THAT
AUD0000001417_S0002461 BASIL STARED INDIGNANTLY FOR A FEW MINUTES
AUD0000001417_S0002466 I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN TO HELP US SAID RUPERT
AUD0000001417_S0002471 BUT SOMEHOW THE INSTANT THE DOOR OPENED HE STEPPED FIRST INTO THE HALL
AUD0000001417_S0002476 THE UNMISTAKABLE VOICE OF THE ISIS
AUD0000001417_S0002481 WITH CURLY DARK HAIR AND A SQUARE SNUB-NOSED FACE
AUD0000001417_S0002486 THAT SAID RUPERT WITH A SAVAGE SMILE
AUD0000001417_S0002491 WAS BIG AND BURLY WITH DEAD BROWN HAIR BRUSHED FORWARD AND A NORFOLK JACKET
AUD0000001417_S0002496 I MUST SAY MR GRANT YOU WERE RATHER SEVERE UPON EMINENT MEN OF SCIENCE SUCH AS WE
AUD0000001417_S0002503 NOW THAT THEY TALK ABOUT THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST THEY THINK THEY DO UNDERSTAND IT WHEREAS THEY HAVE NOT MERELY NO NOTION
AUD0000001417_S0002509 OF COURSE IN A SENSE SCIENCE LIKE MATHEMATICS OR THE VIOLIN
AUD0000001417_S0002516 JUST IN THE SAME WAY SCIENCE HERE MR BURROWS STOPPED ABRUPTLY
AUD0000001417_S0002522 HE WAS A WIRY FIGHTER WHO BENT AND SPRANG LIKE A WHALEBONE
AUD0000001417_S0002528 STILL ONE MUST SIDE WITH ONE'S OLD FRIENDS AGAINST THE MOST FASCINATING NEW ONES
AUD0000001417_S0002534 RUPERT AND BASIL WERE BOTH PARTICULARLY STRONG
AUD0000001417_S0002540 SIMULTANEOUSLY THE BULL'S HEAD BUTTED BASIL IN THE CHEST
AUD0000001417_S0002545 THE BEWILDERED GREENWOOD SPRANG FURIOUSLY TO HIS FEET
AUD0000001417_S0002550 BEFORE I COULD GET PANTING TO MY FEET
AUD0000001417_S0002556 THE OTHER TWO FLEW AT BASIL
AUD0000001417_S0002561 NOW THIS HE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0002566 TO MY ASTONISHMENT HIS EYES WERE REALLY BRILLIANT WITH PLEASURE
AUD0000001417_S0002571 THE LATTER'S HEAD WAS ALREADY SINKING LOWER AND LOWER
AUD0000001417_S0002576 OF ST CHRYSOSTOM'S THEOLOGY
AUD0000001417_S0002583 BOTH SOMEWHAT ENFEEBLED BY THEIR FALLS
AUD0000001417_S0002588 BURROWS AND HIS COMPANION WERE ALMOST UP TO THE KNEES IN THEM
AUD0000001417_S0002593 SHUT FROM ME IN A HUMAN PRISON
AUD0000001417_S0002598 IT WAS SWAYING ON ONE LEG BASIL SOMEHOW HAD HOLD OF THE OTHER
AUD0000001417_S0002603 BURROWS SWUNG TO AND FRO WITH A PURPLE FACE
AUD0000001417_S0002608 AND WITH THREE BLOWS LIKE BATTERING-RAMS KNOCKED THE FOOTMAN INTO A COCKED HAT
AUD0000001417_S0002613 WHOM RUPERT WAS STRUGGLING TO HOLD DOWN
AUD0000001417_S0002620 MY LATE CAPTOR WITHOUT A WORD SLUNK AFTER HIM
AUD0000001417_S0002625 LYING BOUND ON HIS BACK SPOKE IN A PERFECTLY CALM VOICE TO THE MAN WHO SAT ON TOP OF HIM
AUD0000001417_S0002630 THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
AUD0000001417_S0002635 AND KNOTTING A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND HIS LEFT HAND
AUD0000001417_S0002640 DON'T HURRY FOR US HE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0002645 BASIL'S VOICE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONALLY AND NOW MR BURROWS HE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0002652 THAT THE RUDIMENTS OF SCIENCE MIGHT WITH ADVANTAGE BE MADE PUBLIC
AUD0000001417_S0002658 MR BURROWS HOWEVER
AUD0000001417_S0002664 THE BASEMENT FLOOR HAD SEVERAL DOORS
AUD0000001417_S0002669 THE FIFTH WAS LOCKED
AUD0000001417_S0002674 AND CALLED OUT LIKE A MAN CALLING INTO AN ABYSS WHOEVER YOU ARE COME OUT
AUD0000001417_S0002679 FOR SOME SECONDS AFTER HE HAD SPOKEN INTO THE DARKNESS THERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE IN IT
AUD0000001417_S0002684 JUST AS WE HAD HEARD HER DEMAND IT
AUD0000001417_S0002689 AN INSTANT AFTER IT BURNED MY FINGERS AND DROPPED
AUD0000001417_S0002694 AND WE FOUND OURSELVES SUDDENLY AND SERIOUSLY IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CAPTIVE
AUD0000001417_S0002699 THE GLARE OF THE GAS LIT UP HER PIQUANT HAIR AND FACE PERFECTLY AGAINST THE BROWN BACKGROUND OF THE SHUTTERS
AUD0000001417_S0002704 YOUR COMPLAINTS HAPPENED TO STRIKE OUR EARS AS WE PASSED DOWN THE STREET
AUD0000001417_S0002710 DID YOU SAY YOU HAD RESCUED ME
AUD0000001417_S0002716 WHAT DID YOU SAY TO THEM
AUD0000001417_S0002721 DO I UNDERSTAND SHE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0002727 AND SAT DOWN BY THE WINDOW
AUD0000001417_S0002732 COCKING HER BLACK EYEBROWS AND HER SILVER CREST AT US FOR AN INSTANT
AUD0000001417_S0002738 THAT SETTLES IT SAID THE OLD LADY
AUD0000001417_S0002743 WHY SHOULD YOU STOP ANY LONGER WHERE YOU ARE
AUD0000001417_S0002748 AT LAST I SAID
AUD0000001417_S0002753 WE HEARD YOU WITH OUR OWN EARS CRYING BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT GET OUT
AUD0000001417_S0002758 REPEATED RUPERT
AUD0000001417_S0002763 CAN WE DO NOTHING FOR YOU MADAM
AUD0000001417_S0002768 WITH MOUTH OPEN TO SPEAK HE STUMBLED TO THE DOOR OF THE SITTING-ROOM AND SCENE OF BATTLE
AUD0000001417_S0002773 WHO WON'T COME OUT ASKED BASIL
AUD0000001417_S0002779 A BRILLIANT IDEA SWINBURNE JUST UNDO MR GREENWOOD
AUD0000001417_S0002785 FAR TOO MUCH REGARD FOR YOU TO STAND ON CEREMONY
AUD0000001417_S0002790 BASIL SAID RUPERT DESPERATELY FOR GOD'S SAKE COME AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN MAKE OF THE WOMAN DOWNSTAIRS
AUD0000001417_S0002795 EXAMINE THE COAL-HOLE MAKE A TOUR OF THE CHIMNEYS
AUD0000001417_S0002800 BUT IT HAD ALMOST INVARIABLY HAPPENED THAT TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY AND ITS ADVENTURE THINGS HAD CLEARED THEMSELVES LIKE THE SKY AFTER RAIN
AUD0000001417_S0002805 IF RUPERT'S HEAD HAD SUDDENLY FALLEN OFF ON THE FLOOR
AUD0000001417_S0002811 IT WAS NOT UNTIL MONTHS AFTERWARDS THAT BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT AND IN ANOTHER WAY IT WAS EXPLAINED
AUD0000001417_S0002816 WE FOUND THE DOOR OF THE PRISON AGAIN CLOSED
AUD0000001417_S0002821 THE LITTLE OLD LADY TURNED HER BIRD-LIKE HEAD AS WE ALL STUMBLED FORWARD IN THE STRONG GASLIGHT
AUD0000001417_S0002826 I FELT IRRITATED AT WHAT WAS IMPLIED IN THIS SUBSERVIENCE
AUD0000001417_S0002832 THE GOLDEN GASLIGHT LIGHTING UP HIS STRONG FACE AND FIGURE
AUD0000001417_S0002837 AND IT WAS HE
AUD0000001417_S0002842 BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS
AUD0000001417_S0002848 AND THE FACT IS THAT I AM SO MUCH GRATIFIED WITH YOUR EXHIBITION OF LOYALTY THAT I PERMIT MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF EXERCISING SOME VERY LARGE DISCRETIONARY POWERS
AUD0000001417_S0002853 I NEED SCARCELY SAY WHAT I THINK OF YOUR GENEROSITY
AUD0000001417_S0002858 YES IT WILL REPLIED THAT IMMOVABLE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WITH A FACE LIKE A SPHINX
AUD0000001417_S0002863 BUT ARE YOU A MAN
AUD0000001417_S0002868 HERE COMES THE GREEN OMNIBUS
AUD0000001417_S0002873 AND IMPLORED ME TO GO WITH HIM UPON THE LATEST AND WILDEST OF HIS EXPEDITIONS
AUD0000001417_S0002878 THE TRACKING OF A MEMBER
AUD0000001417_S0002884 THE FINDING OF THE CLUB OF QUEER TRADES
AUD0000001417_S0002889 THE ARBOREAL HOUSE-AGENT SEATED BETWEEN THE TWO BRISK YOUNG MEN WHO WERE OCCASIONALLY VICARS
AUD0000001417_S0002896 ALL THE MEMBERS SEEMED TO SINK SUDDENLY INTO THEIR CHAIRS
AUD0000001417_S0002904 I'LL GO AND SEE
AUD0000001417_S0002910 SUDDENLY WE WERE ANSWERED
AUD0000001417_S0002915 HOW WE ATE THAT DINNER I HAVE NO IDEA
AUD0000001417_S0002920 LARKS WERE DUCKS DUCKS WERE OSTRICHES UNTIL THAT DINNER WAS OVER
AUD0000001417_S0002925 AND NEVER THREW ONE GLANCE AT US TO TELL US WHY HE WAS THERE
AUD0000001417_S0002930 GENTLEMEN HE SAID
AUD0000001417_S0002935 YEARS AGO GENTLEMEN
AUD0000001417_S0002940 I WAS ROBED IN SCARLET AND ERMINE NEVERTHELESS
AUD0000001417_S0002945 THE STRINGENCY OF WHICH I HAD TO PRETEND TO RELIEVE BY SILLY IMPRISONMENTS OR SILLY DAMAGES
AUD0000001417_S0002950 OR A TOUR IN THE WEST HIGHLANDS
AUD0000001417_S0002955 THEN CAME THE TIME WHEN I PUBLICLY BLASPHEMED THE WHOLE BOSH
AUD0000001417_S0002962 PEOPLE WERE TRIED BEFORE ME NOT FOR THE PRACTICAL TRIFLES FOR WHICH NOBODY CARES
AUD0000001417_S0002967 OR FOR AN IMPOSSIBLE VANITY
AUD0000001417_S0002972 INCLUDING THE HONOUR OF THE CULPRITS
AUD0000001417_S0002978 RUPERT GRANT WAS STARING AT HIS BROTHER
AUD0000001417_S0002983 SHE WAS ONE OF THE CULPRITS OF HIS VOLUNTARY CRIMINAL COURT
AUD0000001417_S0002989 WE DIMLY HEARD BASIL SAY MR P G NORTHOVER WILL NOW EXPLAIN THE ADVENTURE AND ROMANCE AGENCY
AUD0000001440_S0000011 HE TURNED HIMSELF ABOUT
AUD0000001440_S0000016 EVEN THOUGH HIS FIGURE WAS FORESHORTENED AND SHADOWED
AUD0000001440_S0000022 FROM LOOKING DOWN THE LINE
AUD0000001440_S0000028 HE LOOKED UP AT ME WITHOUT REPLYING
AUD0000001440_S0000033 AS THOUGH IT HAD FORCE TO DRAW ME DOWN
AUD0000001440_S0000038 I REPEATED MY INQUIRY
AUD0000001440_S0000044 ALL RIGHT
AUD0000001440_S0000050 AND UNUSUALLY PRECIPITATE
AUD0000001440_S0000056 IN AN ATTITUDE AS IF HE WERE WAITING FOR ME TO APPEAR
AUD0000001440_S0000061 I RESUMED MY DOWNWARD WAY
AUD0000001440_S0000066 HIS POST WAS IN AS SOLITARY AND DISMAL A PLACE AS EVER I SAW
AUD0000001440_S0000071 IN WHOSE MASSIVE ARCHITECTURE THERE WAS A BARBAROUS DEPRESSING AND FORBIDDING AIR
AUD0000001440_S0000077 NOT EVEN THEN REMOVING HIS EYES FROM MINE
AUD0000001440_S0000111 EVEN IN THAT LAST DESPERATE RESOURCE THE ARMY
AUD0000001440_S0000129 HE REJOINED IN THE LOW VOICE IN WHICH HE HAD FIRST SPOKEN
AUD0000001440_S0000134 WITH WHAT
AUD0000001440_S0000140 BUT I EXPRESSLY INTEND TO MAKE YOU ANOTHER VISIT
AUD0000001440_S0000147 HE SAID IN HIS PECULIAR LOW VOICE
AUD0000001440_S0000153 HIS MANNER SEEMED TO MAKE THE PLACE STRIKE COLDER TO ME
AUD0000001440_S0000158 HEAVEN KNOWS SAID I
AUD0000001440_S0000164 BECAUSE I SAW YOU BELOW
AUD0000001440_S0000169 HE WISHED ME GOOD-NIGHT
AUD0000001440_S0000175 I PLACED MY FOOT ON THE FIRST NOTCH OF THE ZIGZAG NEXT NIGHT
AUD0000001440_S0000180 I SAID
AUD0000001440_S0000185 AND HERE'S MINE
AUD0000001440_S0000191 HE BEGAN BENDING FORWARD AS SOON AS WE WERE SEATED
AUD0000001440_S0000196 THAT MISTAKE
AUD0000001440_S0000201 LIKE ME
AUD0000001440_S0000206 THIS WAY
AUD0000001440_S0000212 I WAS SITTING HERE WHEN I HEARD A VOICE CRY
AUD0000001440_S0000218 AND IT CRIED
AUD0000001440_S0000225 I RAN RIGHT UP AT IT
AUD0000001440_S0000231 I STOPPED
AUD0000001440_S0000297 WITHOUT FIRST BEING PLAIN WITH HIMSELF AND PROPOSING A MIDDLE COURSE TO HIM
AUD0000001440_S0000304 I HAD APPOINTED TO RETURN ACCORDINGLY
AUD0000001440_S0000309 I SAID TO MYSELF
AUD0000001440_S0000314 AND MECHANICALLY LOOKED DOWN
AUD0000001440_S0000319 WITH HIS LEFT SLEEVE ACROSS HIS EYES
AUD0000001440_S0000325 TO WHOM HE SEEMED TO BE REHEARSING THE GESTURE HE MADE
AUD0000001440_S0000330 IT LOOKED NO BIGGER THAN A BED
AUD0000001440_S0000336 YES SIR
AUD0000001440_S0000341 FOR HIS FACE IS QUITE COMPOSED
AUD0000001440_S0000347 BUT SOMEHOW HE WAS NOT CLEAR OF THE OUTER RAIL
AUD0000001440_S0000353 THAT MAN DROVE HER AND WAS SHOWING HOW IT HAPPENED
AUD0000001440_S0000358 COMING ROUND THE CURVE IN THE TUNNEL SIR
AUD0000001440_S0000365 I SAID BELOW THERE LOOK OUT LOOK OUT FOR GOD'S SAKE CLEAR THE WAY I STARTED
AUD0000001440_S0000372 IN CLOSING IT
AUD0000001440_S0000377 TO THE GESTICULATION HE HAD IMITATED
AUD0000001440_S0000386 A TRUTHFUL TRAVELLER
AUD0000001440_S0000400 A MISTAKEN ASSUMPTION ON THAT HEAD MIGHT SUGGEST AN EXPLANATION OF A PART OF MY OWN CASE BUT ONLY A PART
AUD0000001440_S0000405 IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY HOW MANY YEARS AGO OR HOW FEW
AUD0000001440_S0000410 AS HIS BODY WAS BURIED IN NEWGATE JAIL
AUD0000001440_S0000415 IT WAS NOWHERE PUBLICLY HINTED THAT ANY SUSPICION FELL ON THE MAN WHO WAS AFTERWARDS BROUGHT TO TRIAL
AUD0000001440_S0000421 I FOUND IT TO BE DEEPLY INTERESTING
AUD0000001440_S0000426 I WAS AWARE OF A FLASH RUSH FLOW I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT NO WORD I CAN FIND IS SATISFACTORILY DESCRIPTIVE IN WHICH I SEEMED TO SEE THAT BEDROOM PASSING THROUGH MY ROOM
AUD0000001440_S0000431 OBSERVED THE ABSENCE OF THE DEAD BODY FROM THE BED
AUD0000001440_S0000436 I WAS IN MY EASY-CHAIR AT THE MOMENT
AUD0000001440_S0000444 IT BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE PARK A QUANTITY OF FALLEN LEAVES
AUD0000001440_S0000449 THEY WERE ONE BEHIND THE OTHER
AUD0000001440_S0000454 THE SINGULARITY AND STEADINESS OF THIS THREATENING GESTURE IN SO PUBLIC A THOROUGHFARE ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION AND NEXT
AUD0000001440_S0000459 TOUCHED THEM
AUD0000001440_S0000464 NOT THAT I HAD CONSCIOUSLY NOTICED ANYTHING VERY REMARKABLE IN EITHER FACE
AUD0000001440_S0000471 THEY KEPT ME IN TOWN THAT AUTUMN
AUD0000001440_S0000476 HAVING A DEPRESSING SENSE UPON ME OF A MONOTONOUS LIFE
AUD0000001440_S0000482 I KEPT THEM AWAY FROM MINE BY KNOWING AS LITTLE ABOUT THEM AS WAS POSSIBLE IN THE MIDST OF THE UNIVERSAL EXCITEMENT
AUD0000001440_S0000489 WHEN
AUD0000001440_S0000495 WITH THE LAST THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION BUT THROUGH THE BEDROOM
AUD0000001440_S0000501 GIVING SOME DIRECTIONS TO MY SERVANT BEFORE HE WENT TO BED
AUD0000001440_S0000506 AND A MAN LOOK IN
AUD0000001440_S0000511 AND CLOSED THE DOOR
AUD0000001440_S0000516 AND I DID NOT SEE IT THERE
AUD0000001440_S0000521 WITH A SUDDEN START HE TREMBLED VIOLENTLY AND SAID
AUD0000001440_S0000526 HAD ANY IMPRESSION WHATEVER OF HAVING SEEN ANY SUCH FIGURE UNTIL I TOUCHED HIM
AUD0000001440_S0000532 I TOLD HIM NOT A SINGLE WORD
AUD0000001440_S0000537 I WAS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE THAT NIGHT
AUD0000001440_S0000542 THIS PAPER IT APPEARED
AUD0000001440_S0000547 HE BELIEVED I AM NOT CERTAIN AT THIS HOUR WHETHER WITH REASON OR OTHERWISE THAT THAT CLASS OF JURORS WERE CUSTOMARILY CHOSEN ON A LOWER QUALIFICATION THAN MINE
AUD0000001440_S0000554 OF THAT I AM AS STRICTLY SURE AS OF EVERY OTHER STATEMENT THAT I MAKE HERE
AUD0000001440_S0000559 THERE WAS A DENSE BROWN FOG IN PICCADILLY
AUD0000001440_S0000564 UNTIL I WAS CONDUCTED BY OFFICERS INTO THE OLD COURT AND SAW ITS CROWDED STATE
AUD0000001440_S0000570 FOR I AM NOT COMPLETELY SATISFIED IN MY MIND ON EITHER POINT
AUD0000001440_S0000576 WHICH A SHRILL WHISTLE OR A LOUDER SONG OR HAIL THAN THE REST OCCASIONALLY PIERCED
AUD0000001440_S0000581 HE APPEARED THERE
AUD0000001440_S0000586 AND I WAS BY THAT TIME ABLE TO SAY HERE
AUD0000001440_S0000592 BECAME VIOLENTLY AGITATED
AUD0000001440_S0000597 WITH HIS HAND UPON THE DOCK WHISPERED WITH HIS CLIENT
AUD0000001440_S0000603 AND ADMITTED THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN KNOWN MY NAME UNTIL HE HEARD IT CALLED AND I APPEARED
AUD0000001440_S0000608 I SHALL CONFINE MYSELF CLOSELY TO SUCH INCIDENTS IN THE TEN DAYS AND NIGHTS DURING WHICH WE
AUD0000001440_S0000613 AND NOT IN THE MURDERER
AUD0000001440_S0000618 I WAS CHOSEN FOREMAN OF THE JURY
AUD0000001440_S0000634 AND A FINE SONOROUS VOICE
AUD0000001440_S0000639 NOT BEING DISPOSED TO LIE DOWN
AUD0000001440_S0000644 A PECULIAR SHIVER CROSSED HIM AND HE SAID
AUD0000001440_S0000650 AND LOOKED ROUND AT MR HARKER
AUD0000001440_S0000655 BUT I SEE IT IS THE MOONLIGHT
AUD0000001440_S0000661 IT ALWAYS WENT TO THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE BED
AUD0000001440_S0000667 WHICH WAS THAT NEAREST TO MR HARKER'S
AUD0000001440_S0000672 EXCEPT MYSELF AND MR HARKER
AUD0000001440_S0000677 ON THE FIFTH DAY OF THE TRIAL
AUD0000001440_S0000683 HAVING BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE WITNESS UNDER EXAMINATION
AUD0000001440_S0000688 CAUGHT THE MINIATURE FROM THE OFFICER
AUD0000001440_S0000693 AND MY FACE WAS NOT THEN DRAINED OF BLOOD
AUD0000001440_S0000699 AT TABLE
AUD0000001440_S0000705 OUR DISCUSSION WAS MORE ANIMATED AND SERIOUS
AUD0000001440_S0000710 WHILE SOME OF US WERE ALREADY PREPARING FOR BED
AUD0000001440_S0000715 AND STRIKING INTO THE CONVERSATION
AUD0000001440_S0000720 I SAW THE HEAD OF THE MURDERED MAN AMONG THEIRS
AUD0000001440_S0000725 THREE CHANGES OCCURRED NOW THAT WE ENTERED ON THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE
AUD0000001440_S0000731 IN THE OPENING SPEECH FOR THE DEFENCE
AUD0000001440_S0000736 MOTIONING ACROSS AND ACROSS ITS WINDPIPE
AUD0000001440_S0000741 THE FIGURE AT THAT INSTANT STOOD ON THE FLOOR BEFORE HER
AUD0000001440_S0000746 ALTHOUGH THE APPEARANCE WAS NOT ITSELF PERCEIVED BY THOSE WHOM IT ADDRESSED
AUD0000001440_S0000751 AND YET AS IF IT COULD INVISIBLY
AUD0000001440_S0000757 IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT THE COUNSEL FALTERED IN HIS SPEECH
AUD0000001440_S0000763 AND REST IN GREAT HESITATION AND TROUBLE UPON THE PRISONER'S FACE
AUD0000001440_S0000768 STANDING UP IN THE BOX AND LOOKING ABOUT ME
AUD0000001440_S0000773 AS IF TO ASSURE ITSELF WHETHER THE JUDGES HAD RESUMED THEIR SEATS OR NOT
AUD0000001440_S0000779 THE MURDERED MAN
AUD0000001440_S0000784 PASSED OVER HIM HE FALTERED
AUD0000001440_S0000789 THE SAME MURDERER IN THE DOCK
AUD0000001440_S0000794 THE SAME LIGHTS KINDLED AT THE SAME HOUR WHEN THERE HAD BEEN ANY NATURAL LIGHT OF DAY
AUD0000001440_S0000800 THE MURDERED MAN NEVER LOST ONE TRACE OF HIS DISTINCTNESS IN MY EYES
AUD0000001440_S0000805 AGAIN AND AGAIN I WONDERED
AUD0000001440_S0000811 WE RETIRED TO CONSIDER
AUD0000001440_S0000817 DISPUTED THEM FOR THAT VERY REASON
AUD0000001440_S0000826 GUILTY
AUD0000001440_S0000831 ACCORDING TO USAGE
AUD0000001440_S0000838 MY LORD I KNEW HE WOULD NEVER LET ME OFF BECAUSE BEFORE I WAS TAKEN
AUD0000001500_S0000017 AND HAVE NOT KEPT THE COMMANDMENTS NOR THE STATUTES
AUD0000001500_S0000027 LET NOW THINE EAR BE ATTENTIVE TO THE PRAYER OF THY SERVANT
AUD0000001500_S0000033 THAT WINE WAS BEFORE HIM AND I TOOK UP THE WINE AND GAVE IT UNTO THE KING
AUD0000001500_S0000039 AND SAID UNTO THE KING
AUD0000001500_S0000047 THAT THOU WOULDEST SEND ME UNTO JUDAH
AUD0000001500_S0000059 AND TOBIAH THE SERVANT
AUD0000001500_S0000069 OR WHAT I DID NEITHER HAD I AS YET TOLD IT TO THE JEWS
AUD0000001500_S0000079 THE AMMONITE
AUD0000001500_S0000085 NOR MEMORIAL IN JERUSALEM
AUD0000001500_S0000097 UNTO THE THRONE OF THE GOVERNOR ON THIS SIDE THE RIVER
AUD0000001500_S0000107 THE RULER OF THE HALF PART OF JERUSALEM
AUD0000001500_S0000121 THE RULER OF THE HALF PART OF KEILAH
AUD0000001500_S0000137 AFTER HIM REPAIRED ALSO SHEMAIAH THE SON OF SHECHANIAH

AUD0000001500_S0000156 EVEN THAT WHICH THEY BUILD IF A FOX GO UP HE SHALL EVEN BREAK DOWN THEIR STONE WALL
AUD0000001500_S0000162 BUT IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN SANBALLAT AND TOBIAH AND THE ARABIANS AND THE AMMONITES AND THE ASHDODITES HEARD THAT THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM WERE MADE UP
AUD0000001500_S0000170 NEITHER SEE TILL WE COME IN THE MIDST AMONG THEM AND SLAY THEM
AUD0000001500_S0000175 FROM ALL PLACES WHENCE YE SHALL RETURN UNTO US THEY WILL BE UPON YOU

AUD0000001500_S0000199 THE WORK IS GREAT AND LARGE
AUD0000001500_S0000206 SO NEITHER I NOR MY BRETHREN NOR MY SERVANTS NOR THE MEN OF THE GUARD WHICH FOLLOWED ME
AUD0000001500_S0000214 WE HAVE MORTGAGED OUR LANDS VINEYARDS AND HOUSES
AUD0000001500_S0000220 FOR OTHER MEN HAVE OUR LANDS AND VINEYARDS

AUD0000001638_S0000004 OF ALL THE WRITINGS WHICH BEAR THE NAME OF PLATO
AUD0000001638_S0000012 ION THE RHAPSODE HAS JUST COME TO ATHENS HE HAS BEEN EXHIBITING IN EPIDAURUS AT THE FESTIVAL OF ASCLEPIUS
AUD0000001638_S0000017 AND THAT HE KNOWS NOTHING OF INFERIOR POETS
AUD0000001638_S0000024 THE ARGUMENT IS AT LAST BROUGHT HOME TO THE MIND OF ION
AUD0000001638_S0000029 THE POETS AND THEIR INTERPRETERS MAY BE COMPARED TO A CHAIN OF MAGNETIC RINGS SUSPENDED FROM ONE ANOTHER
AUD0000001638_S0000034 WHO ALSO HANG FROM THE MUSES
AUD0000001638_S0000039 LIKE HOMER
AUD0000001638_S0000044 AND FOR A SIMILAR REASON SOME RHAPSODES
AUD0000001638_S0000051 SOCRATES ASKS WHETHER HE CAN SPEAK WELL ABOUT EVERYTHING IN HOMER
AUD0000001638_S0000056 WHEN HOMER SPEAKS OF THE ARTS
AUD0000001638_S0000061 ION IS COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT EVERY MAN WILL JUDGE OF HIS OWN PARTICULAR ART BETTER THAN THE RHAPSODE
AUD0000001638_S0000067 NO THAT IS NOT THE REAL REASON THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES TO THE CONTRARY
AUD0000001638_S0000073 EAGERLY EMBRACES THE ALTERNATIVE OF INSPIRATION
AUD0000001638_S0000080 GENIUS IS OFTEN SAID TO BE UNCONSCIOUS
AUD0000001638_S0000085 IMAGINATION IS OFTEN AT WAR WITH REASON AND FACT
AUD0000001638_S0000090 REFLECTIONS OF THIS KIND MAY HAVE BEEN PASSING BEFORE PLATO'S MIND WHEN HE DESCRIBES THE POET AS INSPIRED
AUD0000001638_S0000132 SOCRATES
AUD0000001784_S0000010 AND ITS VALUE SO FAR AS IT GOES
AUD0000001784_S0000015 LESS ADMIRABLE
AUD0000001784_S0000022 AND SO LIKELY TO SEEM INVIDIOUS IN A BOOK PUBLISHED JUST AFTER THE AUTHOR'S DEATH
AUD0000001784_S0000027 WHICH DOES GIVE THESE PASSAGES AND IS IDENTICAL WITH THE LATER OR STANDARD VERSION
AUD0000001784_S0000037 IT IS A PITY THAT HE DID NOT LEAVE IT UNFINISHED MUCH SOONER THAN HE ACTUALLY DID
AUD0000001784_S0000042 AND LESS GOOD IN THAT KIND
AUD0000001784_S0000048 I DO NOT KNOW THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSIGN ANY VERY SPECIAL ORIGIN TO IT
AUD0000001784_S0000053 WHETHER BORROWING IT FROM LUCIAN OR NOT
AUD0000001784_S0000059 STILL IN THE ACTUAL JOURNEY

AUD0000001784_S0000093 DEDICATION TO THE PUBLIC
AUD0000001784_S0000124 WITH SOME VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS IS MOST MANIFEST
AUD0000001784_S0000129 INDEED
AUD0000001784_S0000135 IT IS SURELY AT THE HEAD OF THAT SPECIES
AUD0000001784_S0000142 WHAT ROMANCE IS TO TRUE HISTORY
AUD0000001784_S0000148 THOUGH I READ THESE WITH MORE ADMIRATION AND ASTONISHMENT
AUD0000001784_S0000153 WHICH THEY HAD NOT ROOM TO EXERT WITHOUT EXTENDING FACT BY FICTION AND THAT ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN THE MANNERS OF MEN WERE TOO SIMPLE TO AFFORD THAT VARIETY WHICH THEY HAVE SINCE OFFERED IN VAIN TO THE CHOICE OF THE MEANEST WRITERS
AUD0000001784_S0000158 THEIR PAINTINGS ARE SO BOLD
AUD0000001784_S0000163 THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE STROKES OF NATURE IN BOTH
AUD0000001784_S0000169 EXACTING THEIR BELIEF OF WHATEVER THEY RELATE
AUD0000001784_S0000174 AND WITH MORE IMPUDENCE OFTEN THAN EITHER
AUD0000001784_S0000179 AND TO THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR OWN
AUD0000001784_S0000187 NOT ONLY WITH CERTAIN AND IMMEDIATE SUCCESS
AUD0000001784_S0000192 THE VANITY OF KNOWING MORE THAN OTHER MEN IS PERHAPS BESIDES HUNGER
AUD0000001784_S0000198 IN THE ACTIONS OF MEN
AUD0000001784_S0000205 WASTE THEIR TIME AND PAPER WITH RECORDING THINGS AND FACTS OF SO COMMON A KIND
AUD0000001784_S0000211 OF DIVERTING OR INFORMING
AUD0000001784_S0000217 AND WHO IS SENT ABROAD TO SHOW MY LORD THE WORLD

AUD0000001784_S0000233 COLLECTED INTO VAST BODIES IN FOLIO
AUD0000001784_S0000240 WHO HAVE NEVER TRAVELED EITHER IN BOOKS OR SHIPS

AUD0000001784_S0000250 OR EVEN OF CIRCUMSTANCE TO HIS AUTHOR
AUD0000001784_S0000255 BUT FOR SOME OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTIONS NATURALLY RESULTING FROM IT AND WHICH
AUD0000001784_S0000261 OR ANY FEAR OF THE IMPUTATION OF BEING A CONJURER
AUD0000001784_S0000267 WHO OFTEN FILL A WHOLE SHEET WITH THEIR OWN PRAISES
AUD0000001784_S0000273 BE BUT A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IN A ROMANCE WITH WHICH MR ADDISON I THINK
AUD0000001784_S0000279 THAT MY VANITY MUST HAVE MADE A HORRID DUPE OF MY JUDGMENT
AUD0000001784_S0000284 THAT MY PURPOSE IS TO CONVEY INSTRUCTION IN THE VEHICLE OF ENTERTAINMENT AND SO TO BRING ABOUT AT ONCE LIKE THE REVOLUTION IN THE REHEARSAL
AUD0000001784_S0000289 TO WHEEL IN AMONG THEM WORSE MANNERS THAN THEIR OWN
AUD0000001784_S0000295 THE KING'S PREMIER SERGEANT-SURGEON
AUD0000001784_S0000300 WHO BY THE NEXT POST
AUD0000001784_S0000306 BY DIFFERENT GANGS OF STREET-ROBBERS I RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE
AUD0000001784_S0000311 BESIDES BEING LAME
AUD0000001784_S0000317 AFTER I HAD WAITED SOME TIME
AUD0000001784_S0000323 SET MYSELF DOWN TO WORK AND IN ABOUT FOUR DAYS SENT THE DUKE AS REGULAR A PLAN AS I COULD FORM
AUD0000001784_S0000330 THAT NO SUCH GANGS SHOULD EVER BE ABLE FOR THE FUTURE
AUD0000001784_S0000337 WHICH I WAS SURE OF ACCOMPLISHING THE MOMENT I WAS ENABLED TO PAY A FELLOW WHO HAD UNDERTAKEN
AUD0000001784_S0000342 THE WHOLE GANG OF CUT-THROATS WAS ENTIRELY DISPERSED
AUD0000001784_S0000348 I HAVE OFTEN SPENT WHOLE DAYS NAY
AUD0000001784_S0000354 I HAD THE SATISFACTION TO FIND MY ENDEAVORS HAD BEEN ATTENDED WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT THIS HELLISH SOCIETY WERE ALMOST UTTERLY EXTIRPATED
AUD0000001784_S0000359 IN THIS ENTIRE FREEDOM FROM STREET-ROBBERIES DURING THE DARK MONTHS
AUD0000001784_S0000365 A DROPSY AND AN ASTHMA
AUD0000001784_S0000370 I NOW DISCHARGED MY LODGINGS AT BATH
AUD0000001784_S0000375 BECAME VOLUNTARY SACRIFICES TO THE GOOD OF THE PUBLIC
AUD0000001784_S0000382 WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO PLUNDER BOTH AS MUCH AS THEY CAN
AUD0000001784_S0000388 WHEN ANY ARE DUE
AUD0000001784_S0000395 THAT HE COULD NOT INDEED SAY THAT THE ACTING AS A PRINCIPAL JUSTICE OF PEACE IN WESTMINSTER WAS ON ALL ACCOUNTS VERY DESIRABLE
AUD0000001784_S0000401 AND NOW LEST THE CASE BETWEEN ME AND THE READER SHOULD BE THE SAME IN BOTH INSTANCES AS IT WAS BETWEEN ME AND THE GREAT MAN
AUD0000001784_S0000406 I REJOICED THEREFORE GREATLY IN SEEING AN OPPORTUNITY
AUD0000001784_S0000412 AND THOUGH I DISCLAIM ALL PRETENSE TO THAT SPARTAN OR ROMAN PATRIOTISM WHICH LOVED THE PUBLIC SO WELL THAT IT WAS ALWAYS READY TO BECOME A VOLUNTARY SACRIFICE TO THE PUBLIC GOOD
AUD0000001784_S0000418 UPON THE TERMS I HELD IT
AUD0000001784_S0000423 WHICH THOUGH IT SHOULD EXCEED MY MERIT
AUD0000001784_S0000429 LAWS NEVER INFLICT DISGRACE IN RESENTMENT
AUD0000001784_S0000437 BUT YOU ARE TO BE HANGED THAT HORSES MAY NOT BE STOLEN
AUD0000001784_S0000442 BUT THAT OTHER VICTORIES MAY BE OBTAINED
AUD0000001784_S0000448 WHICH I PREVENTED FROM BEING REVIVED
AUD0000001784_S0000453 WHICH BY THE TEMPTATION OF THESE REWARDS
AUD0000001784_S0000459 AND HAD PLAINLY POINTED OUT THE MEANS OF SUPPRESSING IT FOR EVER
AUD0000001784_S0000464 AND PUT A LUCKY END IF THEY HAD KNOWN THEIR OWN INTERESTS
AUD0000001784_S0000469 I NOW BECAME THE PATIENT OF DR WARD
AUD0000001784_S0000474 ADDED TO MY ENERVATE
AUD0000001784_S0000480 BUT WAS AGAIN FULL OF WATER
AUD0000001784_S0000485 HAD SO LITTLE EFFECT ON ME
AUD0000001784_S0000491 THE MONTH OF MAY WHICH WAS NOW BEGUN IT SEEMED REASONABLE TO EXPECT WOULD INTRODUCE THE SPRING AND DRIVE OF THAT WINTER WHICH YET MAINTAINED ITS FOOTING ON THE STAGE
AUD0000001784_S0000498 WHILST IT IS GUARDED FROM THE NORTH WIND BY A RIDGE OF HILLS
AUD0000001784_S0000503 THE POWERS OF MR WARD'S REMEDIES WANT INDEED NO UNFAIR PUFFS OF MINE TO GIVE THEM CREDIT AND THOUGH THIS DISTEMPER OF THE DROPSY STANDS
AUD0000001784_S0000510 THAT NONE HATH UNDERGONE THE PAINS OF COMMUNICATING THIS DISCOVERY IN WRITING TO THE WORLD
AUD0000001784_S0000515 FROM CURIOSITY ONLY
AUD0000001784_S0000521 SINCE HE HAD KNOWN IT TO HAVE A SURPRISING SUCCESS IN THE CURE OF A MOST STUBBORN ANASARCA
AUD0000001784_S0000526 WHICH I PRESENTLY FOUND DID NOT SUIT WITH MY CASE
AUD0000001784_S0000533 AND NOT BY A SUDDEN ATTACK AND STORM
AUD0000001784_S0000538 AND ADDED
AUD0000001784_S0000543 TWO VERY FAVORABLE SYMPTOMS APPEARED
AUD0000001784_S0000550 SO THAT THE EARLY FRUITS CAME TO THE FULLNESS OF THEIR GROWTH
AUD0000001784_S0000556 I SAW THE MIDSUMMER QUARTER DRAWING TOWARDS A CLOSE
AUD0000001784_S0000562 I NOW BEGAN TO RECALL AN INTENTION WHICH FROM THE FIRST DAWNINGS OF MY RECOVERY I HAD CONCEIVED
AUD0000001784_S0000569 WITHIN ANY REASONABLE TIME
AUD0000001784_S0000574 AND THE WINTER SHORTER AND LESS PIERCING
AUD0000001784_S0000580 BUT OUR GREAT HASTE WAS NEEDLESS FOR THE CAPTAIN HAVING TWICE PUT OFF HIS SAILING
AUD0000001784_S0000585 HE DINED WITH ME ACCORDING TO HIS APPOINTMENT AND WHEN ALL MATTERS WERE SETTLED BETWEEN US
AUD0000001784_S0000590 AND THERE WAIT THE ARRIVAL OF HIS SHIP
AUD0000001784_S0000599 AND FOUND ME AWAKE AT MY HOUSE AT FORDHOOK
AUD0000001784_S0000604 IN THIS SITUATION AS I COULD NOT CONQUER NATURE
AUD0000001784_S0000610 WHICH WAS NO SOONER TOLD ME THAN I KISSED MY CHILDREN ROUND
AUD0000001784_S0000615 AND OTHERS HERE TOOK THEIR LEAVE AND I HEARD MY BEHAVIOR APPLAUDED
AUD0000001784_S0000622 AND CONSEQUENTLY A HOLIDAY AT THE CUSTOM-HOUSE
AUD0000001784_S0000630 THOUGH SUFFICIENTLY STRONG FOR THEIR BURDEN WERE
AUD0000001784_S0000635 HOWEVER BY THE ASSISTANCE OF MY FRIEND MR WELCH
AUD0000001784_S0000641 IN A QUARTER OF A MILE'S PASSAGE FROM MY COACH TO THE SHIP
AUD0000001784_S0000646 I PRESENTED A SPECTACLE OF THE HIGHEST HORROR
AUD0000001784_S0000651 THAT TIMOROUS WOMEN WITH CHILD HAD ABSTAINED FROM MY HOUSE FOR FEAR OF THE ILL CONSEQUENCES OF LOOKING AT ME
AUD0000001784_S0000657 AND OF THEM ONLY TO THE LOWEST DEGREE THAT IT IS AN EXCRESCENCE OF AN UNCONTROLLED LICENTIOUSNESS MISTAKEN FOR LIBERTY
AUD0000001784_S0000664 A SIRLOIN OF BEEF WAS NOW PLACED ON THE TABLE FOR WHICH
AUD0000001784_S0000669 THAT AT THE FORMER YOU PAY LARGELY FOR LUXURY
AUD0000001784_S0000675 DECLARING THAT
AUD0000001784_S0000682 THIS BEHAVIOR GREATLY SURPRISED ME
AUD0000001784_S0000688 BESIDES THE DISAGREEABLE SITUATION IN WHICH WE THEN LAY
AUD0000001784_S0000693 FISH-WOMEN OYSTER-WOMEN
AUD0000001784_S0000698 SEEMED TO THREATEN ME WITH A FOURTH DISCHARGE BEFORE I SHOULD REACH LISBON
AUD0000001784_S0000703 THERE ARE MANY EVILS IN SOCIETY FROM WHICH PEOPLE OF THE HIGHEST RANK ARE SO ENTIRELY EXEMPT
AUD0000001784_S0000709 AND TO WHOM WE WISH TO BE SUPPOSED PRINCIPALLY TO WRITE
AUD0000001784_S0000717 AND HATH GIVEN RISE TO MORE SPECULATIVE SOCIETIES IN EUROPE THAN I AT PRESENT CAN RECOLLECT THE NAMES OF PERHAPS INDEED THAN I OR ANY OTHER BESIDES THEIR VERY NEAR NEIGHBORS
AUD0000001784_S0000723 AND WITH ENROLLMENT AMONG THEIR MEMBERS
AUD0000001784_S0000729 WHICH WE SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO MENTION PRESENTLY
AUD0000001784_S0000734 I WAS WELL ASSURED WOULD PROMOTE SO USEFUL A DESIGN
AUD0000001784_S0000749 BOTH OF WHICH HAVE MUCH VARIETY THAT BY LAND BEING PERFORMED IN DIFFERENT VEHICLES
AUD0000001784_S0000754 BUT AS ALL THESE METHODS OF CONVEYANCE ARE FORMED ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES
AUD0000001784_S0000760 OR AT BEST A SMALL PART OF HIS OWN BAGGAGE
AUD0000001784_S0000765 IN THE SOCIETY
AUD0000001784_S0000770 SCARCE CONSISTENT WITH THE LIBERTIES OF A FREE PEOPLE
AUD0000001784_S0000776 AND CONSISTS OF A PERFECT RESIGNATION BOTH OF BODY AND SOUL TO THE DISPOSAL OF ANOTHER AFTER WHICH RESIGNATION DURING A CERTAIN TIME
AUD0000001784_S0000782 IN TWO PARTICULARS ONLY HIS POWER IS DEFECTIVE HE CANNOT PRESS YOU INTO HIS SERVICE
AUD0000001784_S0000787 BUT ALL THE INTERMEDIATE TIME YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY UNDER HIS GOVERNMENT HE CARRIES YOU HOW HE WILL
AUD0000001784_S0000793 THIS HE IS ORDINARILY DISPOSED TO ENCOURAGE FOR THE EARLIER HE FORCES YOU TO RISE IN THE MORNING
AUD0000001784_S0000800 BUT AS THIS KIND OF TYRANNY
AUD0000001784_S0000805 I WILL QUIT THE PASSENGERS BY LAND
AUD0000001784_S0000811 GOODS AND PASSENGERS ARE CONVEYED BY WATER IN DIVERS VEHICLES
AUD0000001784_S0000816 FROM THE VEHICLE ITSELF IN WHICH HE STOWS HIS GOODS AND PASSENGERS
AUD0000001784_S0000822 THE PARTICULAR TYRANT WHOSE FORTUNE IT WAS TO STOW US ABOARD LAID A FARTHER CLAIM TO THIS APPELLATION THAN THE BARE COMMAND OF A VEHICLE OF CONVEYANCE
AUD0000001784_S0000827 WITH WHICH HE SWAGGERED IN HIS CABIN
AUD0000001784_S0000835 WITH THE ROUGHNESS OF SURLY AND WHILE HE WAS DEAF HIMSELF
AUD0000001784_S0000840 AS IT WERE IN THE SOUTHWEST
AUD0000001784_S0000845 WOULD REQUIRE THE WATER TO BE LET OUT AT A TIME WHEN NO ASSISTANCE WAS AT HAND THOUGH INDEED THE CAPTAIN COMFORTED ME WITH ASSURANCES THAT HE HAD A PRETTY YOUNG FELLOW ON BOARD WHO ACTED AS HIS SURGEON
AUD0000001784_S0000850 AT LEAST THAT BRANCH OF TAPPING FOR THE DROPSY FOR HE VERY INGENUOUSLY AND MODESTLY CONFESSED HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE OPERATION PERFORMED
AUD0000001784_S0000856 BUT AS A STUDENT
AUD0000001784_S0000861 IN THIS I BELIEVE HE WAS SINCERE FOR HE WAS AS WE SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO OBSERVE MORE THAN ONCE
AUD0000001784_S0000869 AND THERE TO WAIT HIS ARRIVAL
AUD0000001784_S0000875 HE SOON FOUND OUT A FEMALE OF GREAT EMINENCE IN THE ART BUT WHEN HE BROUGHT HER TO THE BOAT
AUD0000001784_S0000881 AFTER MANY SOLEMN PROMISES OF WEIGHING ANCHOR EVERY ONE OF THE THREE LAST
AUD0000001784_S0000886 NOR DID HE GIVE A CIVIL WORD OR INDEED A CIVIL LOOK
AUD0000001784_S0000892 AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY CAME UP WITH US BEFORE WE WERE GOT UNDER FULL SAIL
AUD0000001784_S0000898 THERE IS NOTHING TO EQUAL IT IN ALL THE RIVERS OF THE WORLD
AUD0000001784_S0000904 AND WHICH CONTAINS TEN CARRIAGE-GUNS MORE THAN HAD EVER YET EQUIPPED A FIRST-RATE IT IS TRUE PERHAPS
AUD0000001784_S0000910 AND THE OSTENTATION IS LAUDABLE AND TRULY POLITICAL
AUD0000001784_S0000915 AND SURE I AM THAT NOT OUR HONEST TARS ALONE
AUD0000001784_S0000921 AND IN THE GOODNESS AND SPLENDOR OF THEIR TROOPS MANY NATIONS PARTICULARLY THE GERMANS AND FRENCH
AUD0000001784_S0000927 AS FOR OUR SUCCESSES IN LATER DAYS
AUD0000001784_S0000933 WE CANNOT SAY THAT THE OSTENTATION WAS ENTIRELY VAIN SINCE HE CERTAINLY SHOWED HIM AN ARMY WHICH HAD NOT BEEN OFTEN EQUALED
AUD0000001784_S0000940 AND OUR MAGISTRATES WANT SUFFICIENT POWER
AUD0000001784_S0000947 UNEQUALED IN ANY COUNTRY FOR CONVENIENCE AS WELL AS MAGNIFICENCE BOTH WHICH ARE CONSULTED IN BUILDING AND EQUIPPING HER WITH THE MOST EXQUISITE ART AND WORKMANSHIP
AUD0000001784_S0000954 THE WHOLE FORMS A MOST PLEASING OBJECT TO THE EYE
AUD0000001784_S0000961 AND TO THE NO LESS SENSIBLE GRATITUDE OF THE OTHER
AUD0000001784_S0000966 WHEN WE HAD PASSED BY GREENWICH WE SAW ONLY TWO OR THREE GENTLEMEN'S HOUSES
AUD0000001784_S0000971 ESSEX
AUD0000001784_S0000976 LIKE THE FREQUENT REPETITION OF ALL THINGS
AUD0000001784_S0000981 INSTEAD OF PLEASURE
AUD0000001784_S0000989 GLIDING ALONG AFTER ONE ANOTHER
AUD0000001784_S0000995 TO WHICH SUCH SITUATIONS OF OUR VILLAS AS I HAVE RECOMMENDED WOULD BE SO CONVENIENT
AUD0000001784_S0001000 AND WOULD FALL VERY SHORT OF THE PRICES WHICH ARE DAILY PAID FOR PLEASURES OF A FAR INFERIOR RATE
AUD0000001784_S0001005 TO MAKE TOO LARGE DEDUCTIONS
AUD0000001784_S0001011 AND THE MANY AGREEABLE OBJECTS WITH WHICH I WAS CONSTANTLY ENTERTAINED DURING THE WHOLE WAY
AUD0000001784_S0001016 THOUGH HE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN OFFENDED WITH THE APPELLATION OF TOOTH-DRAWER NO LESS THAN HIS BRETHREN THE MEMBERS OF THAT VENERABLE BODY
AUD0000001784_S0001022 DECLARED THAT IT WAS SUCH A ROTTEN SHELL AND SO PLACED AT THE VERY REMOTEST END OF THE UPPER JAW
AUD0000001784_S0001027 ESPECIALLY IF THOSE YOUNG LADIES HAPPEN TO BE PAST FORTY AND FIFTY YEARS OF AGE
AUD0000001784_S0001033 HE SAID AT LAST SO MUCH AND SEEMED TO REASON SO JUSTLY
AUD0000001784_S0001040 WE WERE ALL ALARMED AT THE SUDDENNESS OF THE ACCIDENT
AUD0000001784_S0001047 IN THE SEA-WAY THAT IS TO SAY BY DAMNING US ALL TO HELL
AUD0000001784_S0001052 TO ASSIGN A SATISFACTORY REASON WHY SAILORS IN GENERAL SHOULD OF ALL OTHERS
AUD0000001784_S0001061 IS IT
AUD0000001784_S0001068 WHO WAS PROCEEDING WITH MY WIFE TO LISBON
AUD0000001784_S0001073 WHOSE APPEARANCE GREATLY CORRESPONDED WITH THAT OF THE SHERIFFS
AUD0000001784_S0001078 WITH A BROAD GOLD LACE ON HIS HAT
AUD0000001784_S0001084 I PROCEEDED TO ASK OF WHAT RANK HE WAS IN THE CUSTOM-HOUSE
AUD0000001784_S0001089 BUT COULD BE NO GENTLEMAN
AUD0000001784_S0001096 THOUGH WE SHOULD NOT HAPPEN TO BE OF THAT NUMBER WHOM THE WORLD CALLS PEOPLE OF FASHION AND DISTINCTION
AUD0000001784_S0001104 THAT THERE IS NOTHING SO INCONGRUOUS IN NATURE AS ANY KIND OF POWER WITH LOWNESS OF MIND AND OF ABILITY
AUD0000001784_S0001109 NOT OF HUMAN BUT DIVINE ORIGINAL FOR AS WE MAKE NOT SHEPHERDS OF SHEEP
AUD0000001784_S0001114 MIGHT REGULATE OUR AFFAIRS AND ESTABLISH PEACE
AUD0000001784_S0001119 WITHOUT ANY DIVINE ASSISTANCE
AUD0000001784_S0001125 WE SHOULD FORM BOTH OUR PRIVATE ECONOMY AND PUBLIC POLICY FROM ITS DICTATES
AUD0000001784_S0001130 UNABLE TO RESTRAIN ANY PASSION
AUD0000001784_S0001142 OF ALL POWERS PERHAPS THERE IS NONE SO SANCTIFIED AND PROTECTED AS THIS WHICH IS UNDER OUR PRESENT CONSIDERATION
AUD0000001784_S0001148 THAT THEY SOMETIMES SEEM INDUSTRIOUSLY PICKED OUT OF THE LOWEST AND VILEST ORDERS OF MANKIND
AUD0000001784_S0001154 SHE IS NOT ALWAYS EQUALLY INDULGENT TO ALL HER CHILDREN
AUD0000001784_S0001160 WHO
AUD0000001784_S0001166 AND FELL DOWN TO THE NORE
AUD0000001784_S0001172 THIS DAY WE LEFT THE SHORE OF ESSEX AND COASTED ALONG KENT
AUD0000001784_S0001178 THE WIND BEING NOW FULL IN OUR TEETH
AUD0000001784_S0001183 BUT WITH NO BETTER SUCCESS THAN THE FORMER
AUD0000001784_S0001188 WHICH CONCLUDED MORE IN HONOR OF HIS JUDGMENT THAN OF HIS OPERATION FOR AFTER HAVING PUT MY POOR WIFE TO INEXPRESSIBLE TORMENT
AUD0000001784_S0001194 NATURE OVERCOME WITH FATIGUE
AUD0000001784_S0001200 IN WHICH I HAD NOT THE LEAST SMATTERING
AUD0000001784_S0001205 I WILL NOT SAY UNDERSTAND MY WORDS
AUD0000001784_S0001217 MY FAITH IN THIS PROPHECY WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO BUILD ANY GREAT HOPES UPON
AUD0000001784_S0001224 BUT AS ALL MEN WHO HAVE EVER BEEN AT SEA WELL KNOW HOW WEAK SUCH ATTEMPTS ARE
AUD0000001784_S0001230 AND ONCE MORE CAST ANCHOR IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF DEAL
AUD0000001784_S0001235 WE WERE INCAPABLE OF PROCURING ANYTHING FROM DEAL
AUD0000001784_S0001241 AS MANY HALF-GUINEAS FOR THESE GOOD PEOPLE CONSIDER THE SEA AS A LARGE COMMON APPENDANT TO THEIR MANOR IN WHICH WHEN THEY FIND ANY OF THEIR FELLOW-CREATURES IMPOUNDED
AUD0000001784_S0001246 OR OF BEING MOVED WITH ANY COMPASSION FOR THEM
AUD0000001784_S0001251 OR PERHAPS IN A MONTH IN BOTH PLACES THE OWNER OF THE BOAT FOUNDS HIS DEMAND ON THE NECESSITY AND DISTRESS OF ONE WHO STANDS MORE OR LESS IN ABSOLUTE WANT OF HIS ASSISTANCE
AUD0000001784_S0001256 NOW AS I AM UNWILLING THAT SOME CONCLUSIONS
AUD0000001784_S0001261 HOWEVER IT BE
AUD0000001784_S0001266 AND CONSIDERING THE DISTRESSES OF A WRETCHED SEAMAN
AUD0000001784_S0001275 AT ABOUT SEVEN MILES' DISTANCE AND AT THE SAME TIME PRESUMED TO MAKE USE OF A GREAT LADY'S NAME
AUD0000001784_S0001280 THOUGH SHE WAS ENTIRELY UNKNOWN TO ME
AUD0000001784_S0001285 HE MIGHT HAVE SENT A WRITTEN ANSWER
AUD0000001784_S0001291 AND ITS APTNESS TO INTOXICATE THE MIND
AUD0000001784_S0001298 AND WEIGHED HIS ANCHOR
AUD0000001784_S0001303 A SMALL SLOOP
AUD0000001784_S0001311 BUT THOSE WHO ARE WITHIN IT ARE ALWAYS IN A PLACE OF THE MOST ASSURED SECURITY FOR WHOSOEVER THROWS AWAY HIS SWORD PREFERS INDEED
AUD0000001784_S0001316 FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM
AUD0000001784_S0001321 KICK HIS PURSUER HEADLONG TO THE BOTTOM
AUD0000001784_S0001327 THE LATTER CONSIDER ONLY THEIR OWN SECURITY
AUD0000001784_S0001334 THIS CONDUCTED US ALONG THE SHORT REMAINDER OF THE KENTISH SHORE
AUD0000001784_S0001340 IN TRUTH MOUNTAINS RIVERS HEROES AND GODS OWE GREAT PART OF THEIR EXISTENCE TO THE POETS AND GREECE AND ITALY DO SO PLENTIFULLY ABOUND IN THE FORMER
AUD0000001784_S0001345 WITH MUCH MORE PLEASURE THAN PROGRESS FOR THE WEATHER WAS ALMOST A PERFECT CALM
AUD0000001784_S0001353 AND MAKING A SUDDEN TACK STOOD IN FOR THE SHORE
AUD0000001784_S0001358 FELL FROM THE WINDOW INTO THE WATER AN ALARM WAS IMMEDIATELY GIVEN TO THE CAPTAIN
AUD0000001784_S0001364 EMPLOYED TO RECOVER THE POOR ANIMAL
AUD0000001784_S0001370 FOR HAVING STRIPPED HIMSELF OF HIS JACKET
AUD0000001784_S0001375 NOR WAS THIS I OBSERVED A MATTER OF SUCH GREAT DIFFICULTY AS IT APPEARED TO MY IGNORANCE
AUD0000001784_S0001380 THE CAPTAIN'S HUMANITY
AUD0000001784_S0001385 IN WHICH INNOCENT AMUSEMENT THEY HAD PASSED ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THEIR TIME
AUD0000001784_S0001394 TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN STRANGERS SINCE THEY LEFT THE DOWNS
AUD0000001784_S0001400 IT WAS IN VAIN TO LEAVE THE SHIP OR TO DETERMINE TO DO IT
AUD0000001784_S0001405 MAY BE ALMOST CERTAINLY PREVENTED WHEREAS THE FRACTURES TO WHICH THE LIVING LUMPS ARE EXPOSED ARE SOMETIMES BY NO CAUTION AVOIDABLE
AUD0000001784_S0001411 WHILST I WEIGHED ALL THAT COULD SUGGEST ITSELF ON THIS HEAD
AUD0000001784_S0001416 FORTUNE
AUD0000001784_S0001422 AND MANY PEOPLE WOULD GO SOME MILES TO SEE THE SIGHT
AUD0000001784_S0001429 AN IMPASSABLE GULF
AUD0000001784_S0001434 THEY HAD BEGUN TO MAKE A SMALL CAUSEWAY TO THE LOW-WATER MARK
AUD0000001784_S0001439 THE CHURCHWARDENS THE OVERSEERS
AUD0000001784_S0001445 AND AFTER HAVING THROWN AWAY ONE HALF OF THE REQUISITE SUM
AUD0000001784_S0001450 WAS IN REALITY A BUBBLE TO HIMSELF
AUD0000001784_S0001455 AND BEING ROWED PRETTY NEAR THE SHORE
AUD0000001784_S0001461 WE BROUGHT WITH US OUR PROVISIONS FROM THE SHIP SO THAT WE WANTED NOTHING BUT A FIRE TO DRESS OUR DINNER
AUD0000001784_S0001466 BEING FULLY SUFFICIENT TO ANSWER OUR PRESENT IDEAS OF DELICACY
AUD0000001784_S0001472 IN EXCUSE FOR THIS DELAY THOUGH WE HAD EXCEEDED ALMOST PURPOSELY
AUD0000001784_S0001478 AND HAD BEEN OURSELVES NOT WITHOUT MUCH CARE AND DIFFICULTY
AUD0000001784_S0001483 WHICH THEY ALWAYS KNOW BETTER THAN OURSELVES NOR CAN ANY BRIBES CORRUPT THEM TO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY WHILE THEY ARE CONSULTING OUR GOOD IN OUR OWN DESPITE
AUD0000001784_S0001490 AND APPLIED HERSELF NOT TO THAT WHICH KINDLES BUT TO THAT WHICH EXTINGUISHES FIRE
AUD0000001784_S0001496 WAS LAID ON THE BRICK FLOOR
AUD0000001784_S0001501 TO DESPISE MY OWN SAGACITY
AUD0000001784_S0001506 AND BIDDING A SERVANT TO TAKE UP THAT ON THE TABLE
AUD0000001784_S0001511 IF THIS WAS GENTILITY
AUD0000001784_S0001516 OR RATHER PERHAPS HER VANITY
AUD0000001784_S0001521 MY WIFE WHO BESIDES DISCHARGING EXCELLENTLY WELL HER OWN AND ALL THE TENDER OFFICES BECOMING THE FEMALE CHARACTER WHO BESIDES BEING A FAITHFUL FRIEND
AUD0000001784_S0001526 DISCOVERED THE IMMODERATE ATTENTION TO NEATNESS IN MRS FRANCIS
AUD0000001784_S0001531 THIS WAS A DRY WARM OAKEN-FLOORED BARN
AUD0000001784_S0001536 AND CAME HASTILY TO SNATCH ME FROM WORSE PERILS BY WATER THAN THE COMMON DANGERS OF THE SEA
AUD0000001784_S0001542 BUT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE BELIEVED THAT QUALITY HAD EVER PREFERRED A BARN TO A HOUSE
AUD0000001784_S0001548 IN WHICH THERE WAS NOTHING DEFICIENT BUT THE QUANTITY
AUD0000001784_S0001554 WE ORDERED OUR SERVANTS TO SEE FOR SOMETHING ELSE
AUD0000001784_S0001560 AND ONE THAT KILLED ALL SORTS OF MEAT IN SEASON
AUD0000001784_S0001565 THIS SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT WORTHY OF COMMUNICATION
AUD0000001784_S0001571 WITH MORE APPETITE
AUD0000001784_S0001576 AS SHE MAY SEEM TO BE THUS INATTENTIVE TO HER OWN INTEREST BUT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE FOR
AUD0000001784_S0001581 THUS WE PASSED A MOST AGREEABLE DAY OWING TO GOOD APPETITES AND GOOD HUMOR TWO HEARTY FEEDERS WHICH WILL DEVOUR WITH SATISFACTION WHATEVER FOOD YOU PLACE BEFORE THEM WHEREAS WITHOUT THESE THE ELEGANCE OF ST JAMES'S
AUD0000001784_S0001586 AS THE WIND APPEARED STILL IMMOVABLE
AUD0000001784_S0001592 IT WAS CONCLUDED THEREFORE THAT SHE AND HARRIOT SHOULD OCCUPY ONE AND MYSELF TAKE POSSESSION OF THE OTHER
AUD0000001784_S0001598 BUILT WITH THE MATERIALS OF A WRECK
AUD0000001784_S0001606 WE HAVE A SOCIETY WHOSE PECULIAR PROFESSION IT IS TO DISCUSS AND DEVELOP
AUD0000001784_S0001613 I FOUND HOWEVER I WAS MISTAKEN IN MY CALCULATION FOR WHEN THE GOOD WOMAN ATTENDED WITH HER BILL IT CONTAINED AS FOLLOWS
AUD0000001784_S0001620 OF WHICH WE ONLY TASTED A SINGLE GLASS THOUGH POSSIBLY INDEED OUR SERVANTS DRANK THE REMAINDER OF THE BOTTLE
AUD0000001784_S0001627 AS IT DOTH IN ITS INTOXICATING QUALITY HENCE AND FROM THIS AGREEMENT IN THE ORTHOGRAPHY
AUD0000001784_S0001634 THE DISAGREEMENT IN OUR COMPUTATION PRODUCED SOME SMALL REMONSTRANCE TO MRS FRANCIS ON MY SIDE BUT THIS RECEIVED AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER SHE SCORNED TO OVERCHARGE GENTLEMEN
AUD0000001784_S0001639 THAT FOR HER PART SHE DID NOT GET HER LIVELIHOOD BY TRAVELERS
AUD0000001784_S0001644 SHE WAS PROCEEDING THUS AND FROM HER VOLUBILITY OF TONGUE SEEMED LIKELY TO STRETCH THE DISCOURSE TO AN IMMODERATE LENGTH
AUD0000001784_S0001650 AND PROBABLY DISCONCERTED THE WOMEN
AUD0000001784_S0001656 AND HE ACTED WISELY I BELIEVE IN SO DOING
AUD0000001784_S0001661 THIS AMIABLE COUPLE SEEMED TO BORDER HARD ON THEIR GRAND CLIMACTERIC NOR INDEED WERE THEY SHY OF OWNING ENOUGH TO FIX THEIR AGES WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO OF THAT TIME
AUD0000001784_S0001666 SINCE THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF ANYTHING BUT POVERTY
AUD0000001784_S0001671 BUT THEN IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ON THE OTHER SIDE
AUD0000001784_S0001677 OR OTHER PERISHABLE COMMODITIES BUT THESE WERE SUPPLIED BY A SMALL PORTION OF THE FRUITS OF THE FARM
AUD0000001784_S0001683 WHO WAS OF A ROUND STATURE
AUD0000001784_S0001689 EITHER IN CHENEY ARBUTHNOT OR IN ANY OTHER MODERN WRITER OR REGIMEN
AUD0000001784_S0001695 THOUGH MANY THINGS CONSIDERABLE IN THEM
AUD0000001784_S0001701 PROBABLY LIVING MUCH ON FISH MIGHT PRODUCE THIS DISGUST
AUD0000001784_S0001707 WHAT HATH PUZZLED OUR PHYSICIANS AND PREVENTED THEM FROM SETTING THIS MATTER IN THE CLEAREST LIGHT
AUD0000001784_S0001714 OUR FARMER WAS ONE OF THESE
AUD0000001784_S0001720 WHEREAS I WOULD ROB HIM OF NOTHING BUT THAT FREE AGENCY WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF ALL THE CORRUPTION AND OF ALL THE MISERY OF HUMAN NATURE
AUD0000001784_S0001725 I MEANT MORE THAN I THEN EXPRESSED
AUD0000001784_S0001730 NOW AS A COUPLE OF THIS KIND WOULD LIKE TWO VESSELS OF OIL
AUD0000001784_S0001735 SHE ABOUNDED IN WHATSOEVER HE WAS DEFECTIVE THAT IS TO SAY IN ALMOST EVERYTHING
AUD0000001784_S0001741 BURST FORTH INTO THIS EXCLAMATION IF THAT FELLOW BE NOT A ROGUE
AUD0000001784_S0001748 THAT NATURE IS SELDOM CURIOUS IN HER WORKS WITHIN
AUD0000001784_S0001754 NOW
AUD0000001784_S0001759 THIS OBSERVATION WILL I AM CONVINCED HOLD MOST TRUE
AUD0000001784_S0001765 BUT
AUD0000001784_S0001772 FOR I SELDOM HEARD IT ON THE SAME FLOOR
AUD0000001784_S0001778 I SUPPOSE
AUD0000001784_S0001783 SHE DIFFERED AS I HAVE SAID
AUD0000001784_S0001788 SHE SEEMED TO REGARD IT AS A TACIT SARCASM ON HER FOLLY
AUD0000001784_S0001793 TO-MORROW AT EIGHTEEN-PENCE AND IF SHE DRESSED US TWO DISHES FOR TWO SHILLINGS ON THE SATURDAY
AUD0000001784_S0001798 WHEN SHE WAS PAID ALL SHE DEMANDED SHE ANSWERED
AUD0000001784_S0001803 WHO TRAVEL WITH MANY HORSES AND SERVANTS
AUD0000001784_S0001808 A VERY GREAT DEGREE OF HUNGER
AUD0000001784_S0001813 AND IN REALITY NO HOUSE TO INHABIT
AUD0000001784_S0001819 FROM HIS OWN ESTATE SUCH ARE THE ARTICLES OF BREAD AND BEER FIRING EATING AND DRESSING DINNER
AUD0000001784_S0001824 OR OF THE STOIC PHILOSOPHERS IN THE WORKS OF LUCIAN
AUD0000001784_S0001832 WE WERE PERMITTED TO REGALE OURSELVES WITH MORE VENISON
AUD0000001784_S0001837 AND HERE I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WHICH POSSIBLY MAY NOT OFFER AGAIN
AUD0000001784_S0001842 WHICH THE GREAT MEN THEMSELVES OR AT LEAST MANY WHO TREAD CLOSE ON THEIR HEELS MAY ENJOY
AUD0000001784_S0001847 OF WHICH
AUD0000001784_S0001853 BY LIBERTY HOWEVER I APPREHEND
AUD0000001784_S0001858 BUT INDEED HOWEVER LARGELY WE EXTEND
AUD0000001784_S0001863 AND BE WITH THE SAME EXTENT ENJOYED BY
AUD0000001784_S0001869 OR OF BIRTH
AUD0000001784_S0001875 THAN MOST OF THEIR SUPERIORS
AUD0000001784_S0001880 HOWEVER RELUCTANT HE APPEAR
AUD0000001784_S0001886 NOTWITHSTANDING ANY BODILY LABOR
AUD0000001784_S0001892 TO WHOM THE PRICE IS DUE
AUD0000001784_S0001897 THE OBLIGATION NEVERTHELESS REMAINED
AUD0000001784_S0001902 WITH THE INDULGENCE OF EASE AND LAZINESS
AUD0000001784_S0001908 WHERE ALL SUCH PERSONS ARE COMPELLABLE TO WORK FOR THE USUAL AND ACCUSTOMED WAGES ALLOWED IN THE PLACE BUT THIS IS A CLAUSE LITTLE KNOWN TO THE JUSTICES OF THE PEACE
AUD0000001784_S0001915 WAS NOT REVIVED BUT
AUD0000001784_S0001920 SHOULD BE WELL CONSIDERED AND THEIR EXECUTION FACILITATED FOR GENTLEMEN WHO GIVE THEIR TIME AND LABOR GRATIS
AUD0000001784_S0001925 THAT THE EVIL WHICH I HAVE HERE POINTED AT IS OF ITSELF WORTH REDRESSING IS I APPREHEND
AUD0000001784_S0001932 AND THAT OFTEN IN NO TRIFLING MATTERS
AUD0000001784_S0001937 MANY OTHERS
AUD0000001784_S0001943 NOT TO BE PAID FOR A LITTLE
AUD0000001784_S0001949 WITHOUT SOME SUCH MONITOR AS MYSELF
AUD0000001784_S0001956 IN HIS POLITICAL ARITHMETIC
AUD0000001784_S0001964 IN SPITE OF SOME ARGUMENTS TO THE CONTRARY
AUD0000001784_S0001969 BUT SO EXTREMELY GOOD AND CHARITABLE TO ALL HER POOR NEIGHBORS WHO STAND IN NEED OF HER ASSISTANCE
AUD0000001784_S0001975 THAT THEY ARE ENJOYED THEREFORE BY SO FEW ARISES TRULY FROM THERE BEING SO FEW WHO HAVE ANY SUCH DISPOSITION TO GRATIFY
AUD0000001784_S0001981 BOTH RICHLY LADEN WITH ALMOST EVERY PARTICULAR WHICH A GARDEN AT THIS MOST FRUITFUL SEASON OF THE YEAR PRODUCES
AUD0000001784_S0001986 WHO WAS STILL IN THE UTMOST HURRY
AUD0000001784_S0001991 UNLESS DELIVERED BY HIMSELF
AUD0000001784_S0001997 AND THENCE TO THE SHIP
AUD0000001784_S0002003 HOWEVER AS MY COMMANDER WAS ABSOLUTE
AUD0000001784_S0002009 IF VIRGIL HAD ANY
AUD0000001784_S0002014 PERCEIVING WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE CLOUDS
AUD0000001784_S0002019 BY SENDING BACK FOR THE GOODS
AUD0000001784_S0002024 AND THE REMAINDER SHE THOUGHT
AUD0000001784_S0002030 I AM RESOLVED SAYS HE
AUD0000001784_S0002035 BUT THIS WAS NOT SO SOON AS WAS EXPECTED FOR
AUD0000001784_S0002040 LADIES AND VALETUDINARIANS DO NOT EASILY DISPENSE WITH THE USE OF THIS SOVEREIGN CORDIAL IN A SINGLE INSTANCE BUT TO UNDERTAKE A LONG VOYAGE WITHOUT ANY PROBABILITY OF BEING SUPPLIED WITH IT THE WHOLE WAY
AUD0000001784_S0002045 THE WHOLE TOWN OF RYDE COULD NOT SUPPLY A SINGLE LEAF FOR AS TO WHAT MRS FRANCIS AND THE SHOP CALLED BY THAT NAME
AUD0000001784_S0002052 AND WOULD LET GO HIS ANCHOR NO MORE TILL HE ARRIVED IN THE TAJO
AUD0000001784_S0002057 A MESSENGER WAS IMMEDIATELY DESPATCHED WITH AN ACCOUNT OF OUR MISFORTUNE
AUD0000001784_S0002063 MENTION ANY PARTICULAR NAME
AUD0000001784_S0002069 IT HAD BEEN INDEED LEFT IN THE HOY
AUD0000001784_S0002076 HAVE HUNTED OUT THE HOY-MAN
AUD0000001784_S0002081 LODGING WAS RAISED SIXPENCE FIRE IN THE SAME PROPORTION
AUD0000001784_S0002086 AND PLACED UNDER THE STYLE OF OVERSIGHT
AUD0000001784_S0002094 AND I BECAME AN EXAMPLE OF THE TRUTH OF THE OBSERVATION
AUD0000001784_S0002099 AND LEFT THE ROOM WITHOUT MAKING ANY ANSWER
AUD0000001784_S0002104 THE WHOLE IS BUT THIRTEEN SHILLINGS
AUD0000001784_S0002111 YOUR HONOR SHALL BE MY WARNING NOT TO BE BIT SO AGAIN
AUD0000001784_S0002116 TO BE SURE I AM OUT OF SIXTEENS AT PRESENT
AUD0000001784_S0002121 IF YOUR HONOR WAS TO STAY ANY TIME LONGER
AUD0000001784_S0002126 I INTERRUPTED HER ACCORDINGLY BY THROWING DOWN HALF A GUINEA
AUD0000001784_S0002131 AND WE SOON AFTER LEFT THE HOUSE NOR WOULD THIS GOOD WOMAN SEE US OR WISH US A GOOD VOYAGE
AUD0000001784_S0002136 FIRST THEN
AUD0000001784_S0002141 WOULD BE MORE THAN A RECOMPENSE FOR THE LOSS OF THE THAMES ITSELF
AUD0000001784_S0002147 A FLEET OF SHIPS IS IN MY OPINION THE NOBLEST OBJECT WHICH THE ART OF MAN HATH EVER PRODUCED AND FAR BEYOND THE POWER OF THOSE ARCHITECTS WHO DEAL IN BRICK IN STONE OR IN MARBLE
AUD0000001784_S0002152 A MUCH FINER INDEED
AUD0000001784_S0002158 AND THAT IS OF A BODY OF CUT-THROATS
AUD0000001784_S0002163 THE MURDERERS OF THE INNOCENT
AUD0000001784_S0002168 ARE THEY NOT ALIKE THE SUPPORT OF TYRANNY AND OPPRESSION OF INNOCENCE CARRYING WITH THEM DESOLATION AND RUIN WHEREVER THEIR MASTERS PLEASE TO SEND THEM
AUD0000001784_S0002174 WHILE I REFLECT ON THE ART AND INDUSTRY OF MANKIND ENGAGED IN THE DAILY IMPROVEMENTS OF COMMERCE TO THE MUTUAL BENEFIT OF ALL COUNTRIES
AUD0000001784_S0002179 WHICH ASSISTED WITH ITS DECLIVITY
AUD0000001784_S0002185 IN A FIELD IN THE ASCENT OF THIS HILL ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE SEA
AUD0000001784_S0002190 IT IS PLACED ON A HILL WHOSE BOTTOM IS WASHED BY THE SEA
AUD0000001784_S0002196 OF FORTY THOUSAND POUND
AUD0000001784_S0002201 MIGHT DICTATE THE SITUATION TO HIM
AUD0000001784_S0002210 BY AN AUCTION AT PORTSMOUTH
AUD0000001784_S0002215 HIS ESTATE AND HOUSE WERE PURCHASED BY A GENTLEMAN OF THESE PARTS
AUD0000001784_S0002221 WE LEFT THIS PLACE ABOUT ELEVEN IN THE MORNING AND WERE AGAIN CONVEYED
AUD0000001784_S0002226 I WILL NOT DETERMINE IT IS SUFFICIENT TO OBSERVE THAT HE WAS A FALSE PROPHET
AUD0000001784_S0002231 FELL DOWN THAT AFTERNOON TO ST HELEN'S
AUD0000001784_S0002239 WHICH WAS MUCH BETTER DRESSED THAN WE IMAGINED IT WOULD BE
AUD0000001784_S0002244 SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN WITH NO GREAT PROPRIETY SETTLED IN PARADISE
AUD0000001784_S0002252 OR A FIRST MINISTER
AUD0000001784_S0002258 BESIDES HAVING BEEN ELEVEN YEARS IN THE ARMY
AUD0000001784_S0002263 BORNE THE VISIBLE STAMP OF THE GROWTH OF THAT COUNTRY
AUD0000001784_S0002269 AND YET THEY SEEMED ENTIRELY TO AGREE IN ENJOYING THE HONOR WHICH THE RED-COAT DID TO HIS FAMILY
AUD0000001784_S0002274 AS WELL AS THE OCCUPATION OF HIS UNCLE
AUD0000001784_S0002280 OFTEN CALLING HIM DICK
AUD0000001784_S0002286 IS NO MORE LIABLE TO CONVERSE FAMILIARLY WITH A LIEUTENANT THAN OF BEING MISTAKEN IN HIS JUDGMENT OF A FOOL WHICH WAS NOT PERHAPS SO CERTAINLY THE CASE OF THE WORTHY LIEUTENANT
AUD0000001784_S0002293 IF A MAN HATH A FOOL OF A RELATION DICK
AUD0000001784_S0002298 THIS MADE HIM SO CHARMED WITH THE LIEUTENANT
AUD0000001784_S0002303 WHILE THIS CEREMONY WAS PERFORMING
AUD0000001784_S0002313 OFT THE ISLAND OF PORTLAND
AUD0000001784_S0002319 SHOWED HIM A DOG'S TRICK
AUD0000001784_S0002325 AND IN ITS TEETH
AUD0000001784_S0002330 THOUGH HE SEEMED TO ADVANCE BUT LITTLE ON HIS WAY
AUD0000001784_S0002335 THE CAPTAIN HAVING GOT AS HE SUPPOSED
AUD0000001784_S0002343 BECAUSE HE DID NOT WELL KNOW WHERE HE WAS
AUD0000001784_S0002348 I TOOK BUT ILL PHYSIC TO PURGE IT OFF
AUD0000001784_S0002354 THE ONLY FELLOW THAT HAD EITHER COMMON SENSE OR COMMON CIVILITY IN THE SHIP
AUD0000001784_S0002360 OR KNOWN WHAT IT IS TO BE MISERABLE
AUD0000001784_S0002366 INDEED I CANNOT
AUD0000001784_S0002376 A FORFEIT WHICH BECAME AFTERWARDS STRICTLY DUE AND PAYABLE FOR THE CAPTAIN
AUD0000001784_S0002382 AND THAT WE HAD PROCURED VERY FINE CLOUTED CREAM AND FRESH BREAD AND BUTTER FROM THE SHORE
AUD0000001784_S0002387 FOR MY FRIENDS OF THAT WHICH IS CALLED SOUTHAM
AUD0000001784_S0002392 AND WHO IS BY THE NEIGHBORING GENTLEMEN REPUTED TO DEAL IN THE VERY BEST AND TO THE READER WHO FROM IGNORANCE OF THE MEANS OF PROVIDING BETTER FOR HIMSELF
AUD0000001784_S0002398 HAD THE WIND BEEN VERY SUDDEN IN SHIFTING
AUD0000001784_S0002403 INDEED THERE ARE FEW INCONVENIENCES THAT I WOULD NOT RATHER ENCOUNTER THAN ENCOURAGE THE INSOLENT DEMANDS OF THESE WRETCHES
AUD0000001784_S0002409 AND WOULD NOT PUT OFF FROM THE SHORE TO RELIEVE IT IN ANY DISTRESS WHATEVER
AUD0000001784_S0002414 AND OTHER EMOLUMENTS OF THE SHORE
AUD0000001784_S0002419 AND WHILE THE CAPTAIN HAD A LITTLE BOAT OF HIS OWN
AUD0000001784_S0002424 IT REQUIRES TO BE A LITTLE EXPATIATED UPON
AUD0000001784_S0002430 PART OF WHICH HE HAD SERVED SO HE PHRASED IT
AUD0000001784_S0002435 THIS AVERSION DID NOT ARISE FROM ANY FEAR OF WEARING OUT HIS BOAT BY USING IT
AUD0000001784_S0002440 BUT DID NOT ALLOW HIS POWER TO EXTEND TO THE SHORES
AUD0000001784_S0002447 BANISHING ALL CAREFUL THOUGHTS
AUD0000001784_S0002452 I CONFESS I HAVE THOUGHT THE STRANGE STORY OF CIRCE IN THE ODYSSEY NO OTHER THAN AN INGENIOUS ALLEGORY
AUD0000001784_S0002458 CONSIDERS THE GREEKS AS A SET OF PIRATES OR PRIVATEERS
AUD0000001784_S0002463 AND BY DEGREES CHANGED THE METABLETIC
AUD0000001784_S0002470 AND FORGING AT LEAST SOME MEANING TO A STORY WHICH AT PRESENT
AUD0000001784_S0002475 BUT THAT THERE IS ONE KIND OF FLESH OF LANDMEN
AUD0000001784_S0002481 AND HERE THEY MORE PARTICULARLY DESERVE OUR ATTENTION
AUD0000001784_S0002486 PASS BOTH AWAY FROM US WITH THE PLATE AND THE CUP AND THOUGH WE SHOULD IMITATE THE ROMANS IF INDEED
AUD0000001784_S0002491 A SECOND HAUNCH OF VENISON OR A SECOND DOSE OF TURTLE
AUD0000001784_S0002496 AND THOSE OF A GLUTTON TO THE STILLNESS OF A SOW AT HER WASH
AUD0000001784_S0002503 HENCE AS WITH THE GANG OF CAPTAIN ULYSSES
AUD0000001784_S0002508 AS WE ARE TAUGHT TO CALL IT SO CHANGED
AUD0000001784_S0002514 THEY KNOW HIM NO LONGER OR IF THEY DO THEY ACKNOWLEDGE NOT HIS POWER
AUD0000001784_S0002521 WAS IT NOT FOR ONE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE SAILOR IS SELDOM PROVIDED WITH THE PROPER BAIT FOR THESE HARPIES
AUD0000001784_S0002527 NAY SOMETIMES THEY ARE SO VORACIOUS
AUD0000001784_S0002533 IN VAIN WOULD THE PRAYERS OF A CHRISTIAN CAPTAIN BE ATTENDED WITH THE LIKE SUCCESS
AUD0000001784_S0002539 AND SUCH LIKE
AUD0000001784_S0002546 BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
AUD0000001784_S0002551 HENCE ENSUES GRIEF AND DISREPUTATION TO THE INNOCENT CAPTAIN
AUD0000001784_S0002556 THAT NONE BUT THE GREATEST OR LEAST OF MEN CAN BREAK THROUGH THEM WITH IMPUNITY BUT FOR ONE OF THESE TWO REASONS WHICH I WILL NOT DETERMINE
AUD0000001784_S0002564 THE JUSTICE OF PEACE
AUD0000001784_S0002571 SHOULD NOT AN IMMEDIATE APPLICATION BE MADE TO THE NEAREST MAGISTRATE OF THIS ORDER
AUD0000001784_S0002576 THE CONDITION OF THIS POOR CAPTAIN WITHOUT ANY COMMISSION
AUD0000001784_S0002582 HE MAY PREFER THE LATTER WITHOUT ANY OTHER DANGER THAN THAT OF DOING WHAT HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DONE
AUD0000001784_S0002588 HAD WE ANY SEAMEN IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
AUD0000001784_S0002596 A CAPTAIN OF A TRADING VESSEL OF WHICH HE WAS PART OWNER
AUD0000001784_S0002604 FOR THE BENEFIT OF CERTAIN MERCHANTS
AUD0000001784_S0002609 THE SUM HE BROUGHT HOME WITH HIM CONSISTED OF NEAR SIX THOUSAND POUNDS ALL IN SPECIE
AUD0000001784_S0002614 AND HAVING THERE LAID THE FOUNDATION OF HIS FUTURE SUCCESS BY HIS SHARES IN PRIZES
AUD0000001784_S0002619 WHERE HAVING ALL HIS MONEY BY HIM IN A TRUNK
AUD0000001784_S0002626 WISELY CHOSE TO REFUND NO MORE BUT
AUD0000001784_S0002632 NOW HOW IT COMES ABOUT THAT A ROBBERY SO VERY EASY TO BE COMMITTED
AUD0000001784_S0002637 DERIVED FROM THE REASONS I HAVE ASSIGNED FOR IT
AUD0000001784_S0002644 A MATTER OF NO GREAT CERTAINTY
AUD0000001784_S0002650 THE ONE LIVING BY THE HIGHWAY
AUD0000001784_S0002656 AND HAD FORMERLY BEEN A PRIVATEERING
AUD0000001784_S0002661 THE AWKWARD AND AFFECTED POLITENESS
AUD0000001784_S0002666 WHICH WAS AS LOUD AS A SPEAKING-TRUMPET
AUD0000001784_S0002671 HE SALUTED THE LADIES ON THE OTHER
AUD0000001784_S0002679 TUESDAY THE WIND BEING LESS BOISTEROUS THAN IT HAD HITHERTO BEEN SINCE OUR ARRIVAL HERE
AUD0000001784_S0002684 THAT WE SUPPLIED OURSELVES IN GREAT NUMBERS
AUD0000001784_S0002689 IT RESEMBLES A TURBOT IN SHAPE
AUD0000001784_S0002696 WHOSE DISTINGUISHING TOOTH HATH BEEN SO JUSTLY CELEBRATED
AUD0000001784_S0002702 AS THE OLD EPICUREANS ARE SAID TO HAVE DONE
AUD0000001784_S0002707 GREAT WOULD BE THE REWARD OF THAT FISHMONGER
AUD0000001784_S0002713 I CANNOT PASS ON WITHOUT THROWING FORTH AN OBSERVATION OR TWO
AUD0000001784_S0002718 FROM THE BEST OF MOTIVES
AUD0000001784_S0002723 A LITTLE RIVULET
AUD0000001784_S0002728 AFTER HE HATH MADE HIS DRAUGHT
AUD0000001784_S0002733 IN THE PRODUCTION OF TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS SHE PROCEEDS WITH SUCH SLOWNESS
AUD0000001784_S0002739 DO MULTIPLY MUCH FASTER
AUD0000001784_S0002745 WHAT SO CHEAP
AUD0000001784_S0002751 HOW COMES IT THEN TO LOOK NO FARTHER ABROAD FOR INSTANCES
AUD0000001784_S0002757 THE GREAT DIFFERENCE IN HAPPINESS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN CONSISTS
AUD0000001784_S0002763 IF AS SCARCE AS AN ORTOLAN
AUD0000001784_S0002769 I SHOULD THINK IT ABUNDANTLY SUFFICIENT TO PROPOSE THE REMEDIES OF IT
AUD0000001784_S0002775 TO THE ERECTING WHICH SO MANY JUSTICES OF PEACE
AUD0000001784_S0002785 I AM ASHAMED TO OWN IT CANNOT FOR SURELY NO CRIME BETTER DESERVES SUCH PUNISHMENT BUT THE REMEDY MAY NEVERTHELESS BE IMMEDIATE
AUD0000001784_S0002790 A SECOND METHOD OF FILLING THE MOUTHS OF THE POOR
AUD0000001784_S0002796 WE MAY BE ASSURED HE WILL LEARN SO TO CONTRIVE HIS OWN MESHES THAT THE SMALLEST FRY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SWIM THROUGH THEM
AUD0000001784_S0002801 OR THE SHAMEFUL NEGLECT OF THE CURE
AUD0000001784_S0002806 WHEN THE CAPTAIN'S VALET-DE-CHAMBRE
AUD0000001784_S0002811 ALL BUT ONE PERSON
AUD0000001784_S0002819 WITH THESE MENACES HE RETIRED AT LAST BUT NOT WITHOUT MUTTERING SOME MENACES ON HIS SIDE
AUD0000001784_S0002824 AS IT COST THE SWISS LITTLE OR NOTHING
AUD0000001784_S0002829 AND CELEBRATING THEIR OWN HEROIC EXPLOITS WITH ALL THE INSPIRATION WHICH THE LIQUOR AT LEAST
AUD0000001784_S0002835 TOM HAD NO SOONER SWALLOWED HIS DRAUGHT THAN HE HASTILY BEGAN HIS NARRATIVE
AUD0000001784_S0002842 THAN HE LEAPED WITH SUCH HASTE FROM HIS CHAIR THAT HE HAD LIKE TO HAVE BROKE HIS SWORD
AUD0000001784_S0002849 WITH AS MUCH FIERCENESS IN HIS LOOKS AS HE HAD EVER EXPRESSED ON BOARDING HIS DEFENSELESS PREY IN THE HONORABLE CALLING OF A PRIVATEER
AUD0000001784_S0002854 I ANSWERED HIM VERY MILDLY THAT I HAD PREVENTED HIS MAN FROM DOING IT
AUD0000001784_S0002861 I SUPPOSE INDEED YOU THINK IT YOUR CABIN AND YOUR SHIP
AUD0000001784_S0002869 EITHER IN ITSELF OR ON THE PRESENT OCCASION BEING INDEED
AUD0000001784_S0002876 THAT THEIR DIET AT LEAST IS WORTH SOMETHING
AUD0000001784_S0002883 I CAUSED A NUMBER OF LIVE CHICKENS AND SHEEP TO BE CONVEYED ABOARD IN TRUTH
AUD0000001784_S0002888 INDEED IT CONTINUED MUCH LONGER BUT AS THIS WAS OCCASIONED BY OUR BEING WIND-BOUND IN OUR OWN PORTS
AUD0000001784_S0002894 IT IS TRUE I WAS NOT OBLIGED TO DO THIS BUT IT SEEMED TO BE EXPECTED FOR THE CAPTAIN DID NOT THINK HIMSELF OBLIGED TO DO IT
AUD0000001784_S0002901 AND AMPLY TO PROVIDE FOR HIS PASSENGERS
AUD0000001784_S0002908 BUT ATTENDED WITH THE VALUE OF TEN POUND MORE IN SUNDRIES INTO THE BARGAIN
AUD0000001784_S0002915 BESIDES
AUD0000001784_S0002921 OR WITH A GREATER OBJECT IN WHICH SENSE IT IS NOT EASY TO SET ANY BOUNDS TO THE USE OF THE WORD
AUD0000001784_S0002928 AND THAT IS THIS HOW COMES IT THAT
AUD0000001784_S0002933 BUT BY WHAT THEY KEEP HE WHO IS WORTH NO MORE THAN HIS ANNUAL WAGES OR SALARY
AUD0000001784_S0002938 ONLY BECAUSE THEY DESIRE TO MAINTAIN THE HONOR OF THE CLOTH BY LIVING LIKE GENTLEMEN
AUD0000001784_S0002943 AND TO WHICH THE NOVELTY OF THE SUBJECT ALLURED
AUD0000001784_S0002948 SO THAT THOSE ABOVE STAIRS MIGHT POSSIBLY CONCEIVE THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE MASTER IN THE CABIN
AUD0000001784_S0002955 AND HIS RAGE BEING PERFECTLY SUBSIDED
AUD0000001784_S0002961 I DO UTTERLY DISCLAIM ALL PRAISE ON THE OCCASION
AUD0000001784_S0002967 WEDNESDAY THIS MORNING THE CAPTAIN DRESSED HIMSELF IN SCARLET IN ORDER TO PAY A VISIT TO A DEVONSHIRE SQUIRE
AUD0000001784_S0002972 THE SQUIRE THEREFORE WAS TO SEND HIS BOAT FOR THE CAPTAIN
AUD0000001784_S0002977 OR AT LEAST SO DISABLED THEM THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER OF ANY USE AND UNABLE TO REACH THE SHIP
AUD0000001784_S0002983 HE DID INDEED LOVE HIS SHIP AS HIS WIFE
AUD0000001784_S0002989 NOTWITHSTANDING THE STRICT RIGOR WITH WHICH HE PRESERVED THE DIGNITY OF HIS STATIONS AND THE HASTY IMPATIENCE WITH WHICH HE RESENTED ANY AFFRONT TO HIS PERSON OR ORDERS
AUD0000001784_S0002995 IF I MAY SO CALL IT
AUD0000001784_S0003001 AND SEEMED TO HAVE SOME MIXTURE OF THE IRISH HOWL IN THEM
AUD0000001784_S0003007 THIS SHIP
AUD0000001784_S0003012 WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD FELT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN HIS OWN
AUD0000001784_S0003018 HE WAS I BELIEVE LIKEWISE A MAN OF GREAT JUDGMENT AND KNOWLEDGE IN THE PROFESSION BUT OF THIS I CANNOT SPEAK WITH PERFECT CERTAINTY FOR
AUD0000001784_S0003023 TO ASSIST ME WITH HIS EXECUTION
AUD0000001784_S0003029 WE HAD NOT HOWEVER SAILED FAR WHEN THE WIND
AUD0000001784_S0003036 AND SEEMED NOT ONLY TO BE SATISFIED IN GENERAL OF HIS BEING BEWITCHED
AUD0000001784_S0003042 FOR THE DETESTABLE SIN OF WITCHCRAFT BUT THAT LAW AND THE WHOLE DOCTRINE THAT SUPPORTED IT
AUD0000001784_S0003047 OR ALLY PRETENSE TO CHARGE FOR
AUD0000001784_S0003052 AS THE CAPTAIN CALLED IT
AUD0000001784_S0003059 HE FALLS TO IT WITH APPETITE
AUD0000001784_S0003064 OR
AUD0000001784_S0003069 YET IN CUTTING HIM UP FETCHING THE JOINT
AUD0000001784_S0003074 PREYS ALL THE TIME ON THE VITALS OF THE MAN
AUD0000001784_S0003079 WITH WHICH THE GREATEST TABLE IN LONDON CAN SCARCE AT ANY RATE BE SUPPLIED
AUD0000001784_S0003084 BY THE CAPTAIN'S ADVICE WE LIKEWISE LAID IN SOME STORES OF BUTTER
AUD0000001784_S0003089 TO TAKE A WALK ON SHORE
AUD0000001784_S0003094 WHEN WE MET AGAIN AND MY WIFE GAVE THE FOREGOING ACCOUNT OF THE GENTLEMAN WHOM I HAVE BEFORE COMPARED TO AXYLUS
AUD0000001784_S0003100 AT THIS TEMPLE OF HOSPITALITY
AUD0000001784_S0003105 AS THE TIDE WAS AGAINST HIM
AUD0000001784_S0003110 WHICH ONLY BEFRIENDED US OUT OF OUR HARBOR AND THOUGH THE WIND WAS PERHAPS OUR FRIEND
AUD0000001784_S0003115 THE CAPTAIN HOWEVER DECLARED THE FORMER TO BE THE CASE DURING THE WHOLE THREE HOURS BUT AT LAST HE PERCEIVED HIS ERROR
AUD0000001784_S0003120 AND ASSERTING THAT HE WAS BEWITCHED
AUD0000001784_S0003125 AND LONG BEFORE THEY WERE PUT DOWN BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT
AUD0000001784_S0003131 THE CAPTAIN PERHAPS HAD ANOTHER MEANING
AUD0000001784_S0003138 BUT IF THIS WAS HIS OPINION HE SOON SAW CAUSE TO ALTER FOR HE HAD NOT MEASURED HALF THE WAY BACK WHEN THE WIND AGAIN DECLARED IN HIS FAVOR
AUD0000001784_S0003144 NAY WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT THE CARTHAGINIANS CAME FROM THE PHOENICIANS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE PRODUCED THE FIRST MARINERS
AUD0000001784_S0003149 THE WEATHER WAS INEXPRESSIBLY PLEASANT
AUD0000001784_S0003154 HERE AN OBSERVATION OCCURRED TO ME WHICH
AUD0000001784_S0003159 AND COMPARED THIS WITH THE SLOW PROGRESS WHICH WE HAD MADE IN THE MORNING
AUD0000001784_S0003164 AND IF THEY HAVE NOT SUFFICIENT PRUDENCE TO PUT BACK
AUD0000001784_S0003170 HOWEVER
AUD0000001784_S0003175 SUNDAY THE NEXT MORNING THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HIMSELF THIRTY MILES TO THE WESTWARD OF PLYMOUTH
AUD0000001784_S0003182 WHICH WERE READ BY A COMMON SAILOR UPON DECK
AUD0000001784_S0003188 EXPRESSING A KIND OF APPREHENSION LEST THEY SHOULD BE SUSPECTED OF BEING REALLY IN EARNEST IN THEIR DEVOTION
AUD0000001784_S0003193 AND ON COMPARING IT WITH WHAT I HAVE FORMERLY SEEN OF THEM AT SEA AND ON SHORE
AUD0000001784_S0003198 WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO FATIGUE OR HAZARD
AUD0000001784_S0003205 AND I TO MY SOLITUDE HAVING FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TOGETHER
AUD0000001784_S0003211 NOR COULD IT EVER HAPPEN TO ONE WHO DISLIKED IT MORE THAN MYSELF
AUD0000001784_S0003217 WERE POSSIBLY THE PRODUCTION OF THE MOST DISAGREEABLE HOURS WHICH EVER HAUNTED THE AUTHOR
AUD0000001784_S0003224 THE THIEF WAS IMMEDIATELY SUSPECTED
AUD0000001784_S0003229 SWALLOWED ANOTHER PIECE OF BEEF
AUD0000001784_S0003234 THIS WAS THE RECOVERY OF THE STOLEN BEEF OUT OF THE SHARK'S MAW
AUD0000001784_S0003239 DURING THIS CALM WE LIKEWISE FOUND THE MAST OF A LARGE VESSEL
AUD0000001784_S0003244 ASSERTING THAT IT IS THE FINEST FISH IN THE WORLD FOR WHICH WE ARE OBLIGED TO CONFIDE ENTIRELY TO HIS TASTE FOR
AUD0000001784_S0003251 OR THE WIND DECEIVED HIM
AUD0000001784_S0003256 WHEN THE WIND ONCE MORE DESERTED US
AUD0000001784_S0003262 AND LIFTED OUR POOR SHIP UP AND DOWN BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
AUD0000001784_S0003267 HAD NOT OUR CHAIRS BEEN FAST LASHED TO THE FLOOR
AUD0000001784_S0003273 TAME DUCK ROASTED
AUD0000001784_S0003278 AND WERE NO MORE HEARD OF THIS DAY
AUD0000001784_S0003284 AS THE EDUCATION OF BOTH SEEMS TO BE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME NEITHER OF THEM HAVING HAD THEIR COURAGE TRIED BY VIRGIL'S DESCRIPTION OF A STORM
AUD0000001784_S0003292 FOR THAT HE WAS SURE OF A WIND AND INDEED WE ALL FIRMLY BELIEVED HIM
AUD0000001784_S0003297 WE WERE SEATED ON THE DECK WOMEN AND ALL IN THE SERENEST EVENING THAT CAN BE IMAGINED
AUD0000001784_S0003302 OUR EYES WERE CALLED OFF TO THE OPPOSITE PART TO SURVEY THE MOON
AUD0000001784_S0003307 WE DID NOT RETURN FROM THE DECK TILL LATE IN THE EVENING THE WEATHER BEING INEXPRESSIBLY PLEASANT
AUD0000001784_S0003313 WHICH IS THAT VERY WIND WHICH JUNO WOULD HAVE SOLICITED OF AEOLUS
AUD0000001784_S0003318 FOR THAT A WIND DIRECTLY IN HIS TEETH WAS WORSE THAN NO WIND AT ALL
AUD0000001784_S0003324 BUT EVEN OUR BREAD WAS COME TO AN END
AUD0000001784_S0003329 AND BECAME AGAIN FAVORABLE TO US
AUD0000001784_S0003335 THE ONLY ONE AS I HEARD OF
AUD0000001784_S0003340 BOUND TO A PORT IN GALICIA
AUD0000001784_S0003347 WE MADE IT UP WITH SAIL
AUD0000001784_S0003353 HOWEVER THE DAY WAS VERY SERENE AND BRIGHT
AUD0000001784_S0003359 WE CAME UP WITH THEM AT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON
AUD0000001784_S0003364 IF WE MAY ALLOW IT THAT NAME
AUD0000001784_S0003370 BUILT A TOWN ON THE RED SEA
AUD0000001784_S0003375 OR AS IT IS COMMONLY CALLED
AUD0000001784_S0003380 TUESDAY THIS IS A VERY HIGH MOUNTAIN SITUATED ON THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER TAJO
AUD0000001784_S0003385 ABOUT FOUR LEAGUES BELOW LISBON
AUD0000001784_S0003390 BETOOK HIMSELF TO THIS PLACE
AUD0000001784_S0003395 AND PARTICULARLY FROM THE PRESENT QUEEN DOWAGER
AUD0000001784_S0003403 IN LITTLE HEAPS TO MANURE THE LAND
AUD0000001784_S0003409 NOTHING ABOVE A SHRUB BEING HERE TO BE DISCOVERED IN THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF MANY MILES
AUD0000001784_S0003414 AND EVERY PERSON IN IT VIEWED BY THE MAGISTRATES OF HEALTH
AUD0000001784_S0003421 WE CAME TO THE CASTLE OF BELLISLE
AUD0000001784_S0003427 AND EXPECT THE ARRIVAL OF THE OFFICERS OF THE CUSTOMS
AUD0000001784_S0003432 AS IT WAS NOT THE WORK OF A MINUTE TO LIFT ME FROM THE CABIN TO THE DECK
AUD0000001784_S0003437 WHEN HE WAS TOLD OF MY LAMENESS HE CALLED OUT WITH A VOICE OF AUTHORITY
AUD0000001784_S0003443 NOR CAN ANY ON BOARD DEPART FROM HER
AUD0000001784_S0003449 AS THE MAGISTRATE OF HEALTH HAD NOT YET BEEN ON BOARD
AUD0000001784_S0003454 AS WELL AS IN TIMES OF DANGER
AUD0000001784_S0003461 OF TAKING AWAY EVERY GRAIN OF SNUFF AND EVERY LEAF OF TOBACCO BROUGHT HITHER FROM OTHER COUNTRIES
AUD0000001784_S0003468 TAKE CARE OF YOUR SWORDS AND WATCHES
AUD0000001784_S0003475 IN A CALM AND MOONSHINY NIGHT
AUD0000001784_S0003480 WHOEVER IS TOTALLY IGNORANT OF SUCH SENSATION IS
AUD0000001784_S0003486 WITH BUILDINGS ARISING ABOVE ONE ANOTHER
AUD0000001784_S0003494 A REFLECTION OCCURRED TO ME THAT
AUD0000001784_S0003501 AND THEN TO BRING A LISBON CHAISE WITH HIM TO THE SEASHORE BUT IT SEEMS THE IMPERTINENCE OF THE PROVIDORE WAS NOT YET BROUGHT TO A CONCLUSION
AUD0000001784_S0003506 HAD HE NOT BEEN PROTECTED AS THE SERVANT OF THE CAPTAIN
AUD0000001784_S0003511 DURST DISTURB HIM
AUD0000001784_S0003518 AND BEFORE THEIR GOVERNMENT COULD BE WELL ESTABLISHED
AUD0000001784_S0003525 ABOUT SEVEN IN THE EVENING I GOT INTO A CHAISE ON SHORE
AUD0000001784_S0003531 AND HATH A VERY FINE PROSPECT OF THE RIVER TAJO FROM LISBON TO THE SEA
AUD0000001801_S0000020 THERE LIES THE SCENE
AUD0000001801_S0000028 AND THE DEEP-DRAWING BARKS DO THERE DISGORGE THEIR WAR-LIKE FRAUGHTAGE
AUD0000001801_S0000035 BUT SUITED IN LIKE CONDITIONS AS OUR ARGUMENT
AUD0000001801_S0000042 CALL HERE MY VARLET I'LL UNARM AGAIN
AUD0000001801_S0000048 AND SKILFUL TO THEIR STRENGTH
AUD0000001801_S0000053 WELL I HAVE TOLD YOU ENOUGH OF THIS FOR MY PART I'LL NOT MEDDLE NOR MAKE NO FARTHER
AUD0000001801_S0000060 WHAT GODDESS E'ER SHE BE DOTH LESSER BLENCH AT SUFF'RANCE THAN I DO
AUD0000001801_S0000067 AS WEDGED WITH A SIGH
AUD0000001801_S0000072 BURIED THIS SIGH IN WRINKLE OF A SMILE
AUD0000001801_S0000079 I TELL THEE PANDARUS
AUD0000001801_S0000085 HANDLEST IN THY DISCOURSE O THAT HER HAND
AUD0000001801_S0000090 WHEN I SAY I LOVE HER BUT SAYING THUS INSTEAD OF OIL AND BALM

AUD0000001872_S0000942 THE NEXT ACT CLOSED THE CEREMONIES AND WAS A MOVING SURPRISE
AUD0000001872_S0000949 WITH THE LAST NOTE THE BANDS BURST OUT WITH A CRASH AND WOKE THE MOUNTAINS WITH THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER IN A WAY TO MAKE A BODY'S HEART SWELL AND THUMP AND HIS HAIR RISE

AUD0000001872_S0000991 IF SHE COULD SEE ME SHE WOULD KNOW ME AND SOUND MY CALL
AUD0000001872_S0000996 BUT SHE WILL NEVER SEE ME FOR THEY DO NOT LET ME OUT OF THIS SHABBY STABLE A FOUL AND MISERABLE PLACE WITH MOST TWO WRECKS LIKE MYSELF FOR COMPANY

AUD0000001872_S0001013 HOW SHE GOT THERE MUST REMAIN A MYSTERY
AUD0000001872_S0001020 BEFORE HELP COULD REACH HER THE BULL WAS BACK AGAIN
AUD0000001872_S0001026 THEIR NAMES FELL SOFTLY AND CARESSINGLY FROM HER LIPS ONE BY ONE WITH PAUSES BETWEEN

POD0000000007_S0000017 SO THEY DECIDED TO GO HANG OUT AT THE LOCAL AIRPORT AS YOU DO AS YOU DO WHEN YOU LIVE IN A TINY TOWN IN CANADA
POD0000000007_S0000032 IT WASN'T JUST SOME TINY AIRPORT IN SOME TINY TOWN IT WAS A VERY LARGE VERY IMPORTANT AIRPORT IN SOME TINY TOWN BUT BEFORE WE HEAR HOW THIS PLACE CAME TO BE
POD0000000007_S0000045 THEY WERE DESIGNED BY FAMOUS MID-CENTURY DESIGNERS LIKE CHARLES AND RAY EAMES AND ROBIN BUSH THE GANDER INTERNATIONAL LOUNGE HAS BEEN CALLED THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT MODERNIST ROOM IN CANADA EVEN THE BATHROOMS ARE THEIR OWN AMAZING TIME CAPSULE
POD0000000007_S0000051 IT HAS TWO SHOWERS BECAUSE YES PEOPLE USE THE SHOWER AT THE AIRPORT THERE IS TWO SHOWERS IN THIS ROOM AS WELL AS IN THE MEN'S
POD0000000007_S0000064 IT MADE SENSE TO START THERE IF YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT GETTING ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WITH ENOUGH FUEL
POD0000000007_S0000070 IN THE TWO DECADES BEFORE THE WAR
POD0000000007_S0000087 JETS LIKE THE DE HAVILLAND COMET AND THE DC EIGHT WERE INTRODUCED
POD0000000007_S0000102 ESPECIALLY TO COMMUNIST COUNTRIES WHO COULDN'T FLY TO THE U S OR USE ITS AIRSPACE
POD0000000007_S0000109 FOR RESIDENTS OF GANDER LIFE WAS ALSO ABOUT LIVING ALONGSIDE PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO WORKED FOR THE AIRLINES
POD0000000007_S0000118 AND MAYBE IT WAS ALL THOSE TRIPS TO NEW YORK THAT PREPARED THE PEOPLE OF GANDER FOR SEPTEMBER ELEVEN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE
POD0000000007_S0000132 WE'RE HERE WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU UNTIL YOU'RE READY TO LEAVE
POD0000000007_S0000151 A FEW YEARS AGO THE AIRPORT AUTHORITY WAS THINKING OF TEARING DOWN THE INTERNATIONAL LOUNGE AND BUILDING SOMETHING SMALLER
POD0000000007_S0000158 WHEN YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF TO GO THROUGH SECURITY
POD0000000015_S0000016 IN OTHER WORDS GET OFF MY TRIANGLE JERKS
POD0000000015_S0000021 ALTHOUGH THERE HAD BEEN CASES WHERE EMINENT DOMAIN HAS BEEN CONTROVERSIALLY USED FOR PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY
POD0000000015_S0000033 A DEVELOPER WANTED TO BUILD A SHOPPING CENTER THAT WOULD TAKE UP THE ENTIRE BLOCK WHERE EDITH MACEFIELD HAVE LIVED FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS
POD0000000015_S0000042 HI I'M BARRY MARTIN

POD0000000015_S0000068 SHE PASSED AWAY IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT MORE LATER
POD0000000015_S0000080 THE ARCHITECTS EVEN DESIGNED THE BUILDING IN SUCH A WAY THAT IF MRS MACEFIELD EVER DECIDED TO MOVE
POD0000000015_S0000092 YOU KNOW BALLARD WAS CHANGING
POD0000000015_S0000105 SHE KNEW WHERE EVERYTHING WAS IN HER HOUSE
POD0000000015_S0000117 BECAUSE

POD0000000023_S0000043 MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT THE LIMITS ON HEIGHT ARE TECHNOLOGICAL
POD0000000023_S0000057 HE HAD ALREADY DESIGNED BIG BUILDINGS IN OTHER CITIES IN TAIWAN AND ALL AROUND CHINA WHEN HE STARTED PLANNING THIS PROJECT BACK IN THE LATE NINETY S
POD0000000023_S0000080 IT'S THE MAIN ATTRACTION SO OF COURSE AVERY WENT TO SEE IT THIS IS LIKE THE NINETY FIRST
POD0000000023_S0000094 THEY COME IN BLACK RED
POD0000000031_S0000007 OUR OFFICE RECEIVES A LOT OF BOOKS BUT THIS ONE
POD0000000031_S0000017 LOOK THROUGH IT AND THEN HAVE ANYTHING THEIR HEART DESIRED DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO THEIR DOORSTEP

POD0000000031_S0000050 SEARS IS WARNING YOU UP FRONT DO NOT LISTEN TO THAT MAN
POD0000000031_S0000066 MOST AMERICAN FAMILIES WERE STILL LIVING IN MULTI-GENERATIONAL HOUSING

POD0000000031_S0000079 THE LARGEST IN CAIRO ILLINOIS AT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO RIVERS
POD0000000031_S0000088 THEY RANGE FROM EVERYTHING FROM WHAT I WOULD CALL A HUNTER'S CABIN LITERALLY A TWO ROOM HOUSE FOR TWO OR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO THE SEARS MAGNOLIA WHICH WAS TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET TWO FULL BATHROOMS UPSTAIRS A HALF BATHROOM DOWNSTAIRS TWO FULL FIREPLACES
POD0000000031_S0000105 SEARS EVEN HAD THIS AD IN THE FRONT OF THE CATALOG SHOWED TWO RODESSA MODELS ONE OF SEARS MOST POPULAR HOUSES BEING BUILT SIDE BY SIDE
POD0000000031_S0000112 AND I HAVE HEARD MANY STORIES ABOUT FAMILIES RECEIVING THEIR KIT HOME AND CALLING ON NEIGHBORS TO HELP THEM COME OUT AND START THE PROCESS OF BUILDING THE HOUSE FOR MANY FAMILIES THESE WERE THEIR FIRST HOMES WITH THINGS LIKE CENTRAL HEATING AND INSULATION
POD0000000031_S0000119 FROM THE BEGINNING SEARS HAD MADE SURE THEIR MORTGAGE POLICY WAS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THEIR CATALOG
POD0000000031_S0000133 THEY SURVIVED
POD0000000031_S0000140 OR DIDN'T CARE TO KNOW
POD0000000031_S0000145 SO A LOT OF THEM ENDED UP BEING RENOVATED BEYOND RECOGNITION
POD0000000031_S0000167 IT WAS STILL SAFE
POD0000000031_S0000182 TRYING TO MAKE IT RIGHT
POD0000000031_S0000200 NOW MAYBE ONLY A THIRD OF THEM ARE LEFT

POD0000000031_S0000241 AND IT'S MATCH
POD0000000031_S0000253 THERE ARE STILL MORE HOUSES WAITING TO BE INVESTIGATED
POD0000000031_S0000260 ELGIN ENTERED A LOCALIZED RECESSION
POD0000000031_S0000269 WOULD HELP TO LAUNCH WHAT HAS BECOME A SEARS HOUSE HUNTING MOVEMENT

POD0000000039_S0000018 SO JULIA DEVELOPED A MISTRUST OF THE BIG BUILDING THE BIG PROJECT AND PLACES WHERE PEOPLE SEEM TO LOVE THE GLORY OF THE GRANDIOSE BUT I'M ALSO FASCINATED BY THOSE KINDS OF PLACES I CANNOT STAY AWAY FROM THEM
POD0000000039_S0000036 AND NOW THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO TAKE EVERYTHING AWAY FROM US
POD0000000039_S0000050 PLUS I THINK OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN'S XANADU IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST SONGS EVER WRITTEN I SEE WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO THERE JULIA AND IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK
POD0000000039_S0000056 ROSEBUD
POD0000000039_S0000074 ORDINARILY I HATE THESE BOULEVARDS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY CROSS THEM
POD0000000039_S0000091 THE WORKERS SHOWED UP WITH A HUGE CRANE TO HAULL IT AWAY KRAVETS ASKS WHO THEY WORK FOR AND THE SUPERVISOR THIS BIG BURLY GUY SAYS
POD0000000048_S0000019 SO IT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE YOU THAT ARCHITECTS DO AS WELL
POD0000000048_S0000026 INMATES HAVE NAMES FOR THESE PLACES THE BOX OR THE BING
POD0000000048_S0000039 SHE WENT INSIDE ONE OF THE CELLS AND HAD AN INMATE ROBERT LUCA
POD0000000048_S0000047 IT'S THE AMOUNT OF TIME MANY PRISONERS SPEND IN THAT CELL ALONE
POD0000000048_S0000056 YOUR EYE DETERIORATES
POD0000000048_S0000065 THESE POROUS DOORS ALLOW FOR INMATES TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NO LINES OF SIGHT TO ANY PRISONER FROM WITHIN THE CELL
POD0000000048_S0000072 TERRY KUPERS SAYS SHARING A CELL IS OFTEN WORSE THAN BEING ALONE
POD0000000048_S0000081 I'M NOT GOING TO NOBODY'S GOING TO SAY THAT THE ARCHITECTS WHO DESIGNED THE AUTO BODY SHOP OR SOMEHOW RESPONSIBLE
POD0000000048_S0000089 THEY'RE USING THE SAME TOOLS THAT I USE TO MAKE RESIDENTIAL ADDITIONS FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE SCHOOLS
POD0000000048_S0000096 HOURS FROM ANY MAJOR CITY
POD0000000048_S0000112 IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THE LEAST THAT ARCHITECTS COULD DO WOULD SAY TO DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY AND WELL BEING IS TO SAY WHEN YOU ENTER ONE OF OUR BUILDINGS IT'S NOT INTENDED TO KILL YOU OR TO TORTURE YOU
POD0000000048_S0000123 THE EMPHASIS WAS ON CURING OR REHABILITATING PEOPLE FROM A LIFE OF CRIME
POD0000000048_S0000130 BUT WHEN YOU CREATE A BUILDING WITH A VERY EXTREME DESIGN INTENT WITH LITTLE VARIABILITY
POD0000000048_S0000136 RAPHAEL SPERRY MAY FIND HE HAS A STRANGE AND POWERFUL ALLY IN HIS FIGHT TO STOP ARCHITECTS BUILDING SUPERMAX PRISONS
POD0000000056_S0000023 AND THEY WEREN'T VERY GOOD AT TREATING CANCER YET SO THAT CREMATORIUM SMOKESTACK
POD0000000056_S0000031 SO THEY'D TURN AWAY PATIENTS WHO WERE LIKELY TO SKEW THE NUMBERS
POD0000000056_S0000046 RICH PEOPLE STILL MOSTLY RECEIVED CARE AT HOME BUT HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS WANTED TO CHANGE THAT ARCHITECTURE IS A TOOL OF PERSUASION TO CONVINCE WEALTHIER PEOPLE TO COME TO THE HOSPITAL TO BE HEALED
POD0000000056_S0000059 THIS IDEA THAT SICKNESS WAS SPREAD BY POLLUTED SMELLY AIR WAS CALLED THE MIASMA THEORY
POD0000000056_S0000090 NOW IT'S SEVENTEEN CONDO UNITS A PARKING GARAGE A SPA A POOL AND A FITNESS CENTER THE HOSPITAL CASTLE ON THE PARK FINALLY BECAME ON THE INSIDE WHAT HAD ALWAYS PRETENDED TO BE ON THE OUTSIDE A NICE PLACE FOR RICH PEOPLE

POD0000000080_S0000036 RAJNEESH WAS KNOWN FOR A TECHNIQUE CALLED DYNAMIC MEDITATION IT WAS INTENDED TO QUIET THE MIND PRACTITIONERS CLOSE THEIR EYES AND CONCENTRATE ON THEIR BREATHING
POD0000000080_S0000046 IT WAS ALMOST LIKE

POD0000000080_S0000068 A DISCOTHEQUE A POST OFFICE

POD0000000080_S0000085 THE DUSTY GOLDEN VALLEY WAS GREEN WE HAD AN AMAZING ORGANIC FARM

POD0000000088_S0000014 WHAT'S KNOWN AS A NECROPOLIS
POD0000000088_S0000024 AND THEN I HAVE TWO HUMAN NEIGHBORS ON EAST AND WEST
POD0000000088_S0000039 GRAVES WERE ALL AROUND IT WAS NO BIG DEAL MUNICIPAL BURYING GROUNDS WERE RIGHT DOWNTOWN AND THEY WERE RELATIVELY SMALL CROWDED PLACES
POD0000000088_S0000056 MOUNT AUBURN MADE BURIAL SOMETHING REMOVED FROM NORMAL EXISTENCE
POD0000000088_S0000064 AND IT WOULD GO ON TO INFLUENCE THE DESIGN OF PUBLIC SPACES MORE BROADLY
POD0000000088_S0000072 IT COULD BE FOR FIVE OR TEN YEARS TO A HUNDRED YEARS AND IF THE FAMILY DOESN'T MAINTAIN THAT LEASE THEN THE REMAINS ARE DUG UP OR DISINTERRED AND WHAT IS LEFT IS OFTEN BURNED
POD0000000088_S0000083 SO THE CITY SAID THE BODIES HAVE TO BE DISINTERRED AND MOVED
POD0000000088_S0000090 THE MASS GRAVE HEADSTONES ENDED UP ALONG OCEAN BEACH
POD0000000088_S0000100 BUT THE DAY THAT I WAKE UP THAT I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO I'M PROBABLY GOING TO BE MOVING INTO A CEMETERY
POD0000000088_S0000105 I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MY BODY AFTER I DIE
POD0000000088_S0000112 WHERE YOU HAVE A SMALL BOX CONTAINING AN URN WITH ASHES BUT WITH CREMATION
POD0000000088_S0000121 SAN FRANCISCO'S NINETEENTH CENTURY RESIDENTS COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED THAT THEY'D BE EVICTED AND RELOCATED MILES AWAY FROM THEIR HOMETOWN TO A CITY OF THE DEAD
POD0000000096_S0000013 HE'S AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF THE HISTORY OF PHYSICS AND TECHNOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AUSTIN BASICALLY THERE WAS NO OUTDOOR LIGHTING THERE WAS MOONLIGHT
POD0000000096_S0000025 CARBON ARC LIGHTS WERE STILL SO EXCITING
POD0000000096_S0000042 BUT WHILE AUSTIN WAS FUTZING AROUND WITH DIFFERENT BULBS
POD0000000096_S0000058 RICHARD LINKLATER MADE A FAKE MOONLIGHT TOWER THE ONE IN THE MOVIE HAD A LADDER NOT THE PULLEY THING
POD0000000096_S0000069 WELL PEOPLE JUST SAID WHY SHOULD WE LOSE IT
POD0000000096_S0000089 STILL THE SERVANT GIRL ANNIHILATOR BECAME THE GENESIS STORY THAT AUSTINITES TELL ABOUT THESE LIGHTS AND THE STORY OF THE SERVANT GIRL ANNIHILATOR DOES TRULY ILLUSTRATE THE LIMITATIONS OF NINETEENTH CENTURY NIGHTTIME
POD0000000104_S0000006 GO DO THAT NOW BEFORE YOU HEAR THIS ONE
POD0000000104_S0000025 THERE WERE THIRTEEN THOUSAND APARTMENTS AND MANY OF THEM WERE UNOCCUPIED
POD0000000104_S0000038 THE NETHERLANDS COLONIZED THIS PART OF SOUTH AMERICA AS WELL AS A HANDFUL OF ISLANDS IN THE CARIBBEAN
POD0000000104_S0000046 THREE THOUSAND AT LEAST EVERY MONTH A MOVEMENT HAD STARTED WITHIN SURINAME FOR INDEPENDENCE FROM THEIR FORMER COLONIAL RULERS
POD0000000104_S0000063 ULTIMATELY A LOT OF THE SQUATTERS WERE GIVEN LEGITIMATE LEASES AND OVER TIME MORE AND MORE SURINAMESE DUTCH MOVED TO THE BIJLMER
POD0000000104_S0000084 BUT HE POINTS OUT AND I THINK RIGHTLY THAT THE BIJLMERMEER WAS FAILING BEFORE THE SURINAMESE SHOWED UP SO HERE'S A BUNCH OF WHITE GUYS
POD0000000104_S0000098 BUT THERE WERE STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVING THERE
POD0000000104_S0000113 ONE DAY WHEN TAHIRAH WAS AROUND ELEVEN SHE WAS PLAYING OUTSIDE WITH HER LITTLE THREE-YEAR-OLD BROTHER WHEN SHE NOTICED THAT HE WAS CARRYING AROUND SOMETHING STRANGE THAT HE PICKED UP OFF THE GROUND A HEROIN NEEDLE I MEAN I WAS SMALL I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A DRUG NEEDLE SO
POD0000000104_S0000125 FINALLY THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC
POD0000000104_S0000140 THE ONLY THING WE GET IS OUR LIFE
POD0000000104_S0000148 AFTER THE PLANE CRASH THE CITY WAITED A COUPLE OF YEARS TO MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO THE BIJLMER
POD0000000104_S0000168 NO CAR NEEDED
POD0000000104_S0000184 PROGRAMS WERE SET UP FOR JOB TRAINING AND EDUCATION AND SPECIAL HOUSING WAS OPENED FOR HEROIN ADDICTS
POD0000000104_S0000197 WE WERE NEVER THE PROBLEM
POD0000000112_S0000010 WE DID A COUPLE OF STORIES ON THIS A FEW YEARS AGO AND WE'VE COMPILED THEM TOGETHER INTO THIS EPISODE
POD0000000112_S0000026 IT'S SO OUT OF CONTEXT TO ANYTHING ELSE NEXT TO IT ON EITHER SIDE THAT'S FILMMAKER FELICIA LOWE
POD0000000112_S0000040 EARLY IN THE MORNING OF APRIL EIGHTEENTH OF THAT YEAR SAN FRANCISCANS WOKE UP TO A SEVEN POINT EIGHT MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE
POD0000000112_S0000049 SHE SAYS THAT IN THE WAKE OF THE DISASTER
POD0000000112_S0000067 THEY WOULD BE TAKEN THROUGH DIMLY LIT BUILDINGS AND SHOWN OPIUM SMOKERS AND PROSTITUTES AND GAMBLING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT SOME OF THESE SCENES MAY HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN STAGED BY THE GUIDES THEMSELVES
POD0000000112_S0000074 IT'S VERY RACIALIZED THIS VIEW
POD0000000112_S0000089 SHE SENT HER CULTURAL GENERAL FROM WASHINGTON TO MEET WITH SAN FRANCISCO OFFICIALS BUT THE COUP DE GRAS WAS FINANCIAL
POD0000000112_S0000097 BUT THEY DIDN'T STOP THERE THE FIRE HAD LEFT CHINATOWN A BLANK SLATE
POD0000000112_S0000105 NOW LOOK'S PLAN MIGHT SEEM A BIT COUNTERINTUITIVE AT FIRST
POD0000000112_S0000111 THESE TWO MEN HAD NEVER BEEN TO CHINA AT THE TIME THE ARCHITECTS WERE NOT TRAINED INTO TRADITION OR ANYTHING ABOUT ORIENTAL ARCHITECTURE BECAUSE ALSO AT THE TIME THE ORIENT WAS CONSIDERED WAY BEHIND THE WEST
POD0000000112_S0000125 THEY WERE WRONG IN ALL THE RIGHT WAYS TOURISTS LOVED THE NEW CHINATOWN
POD0000000112_S0000131 CHINATOWN IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTED PLACES ON THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
POD0000000112_S0000148 SO ONLY THE CHINESE WERE FORCED TO CATER TO WHITE PEOPLE'S FANTASIES AS A SURVIVAL MECHANISM WELL THAT'S THE IRONY AT THAT TIME WE HAD TO PROMOTE OUR FOREIGNNESS TO BE ACCEPTED
POD0000000112_S0000173 ROOTED IN SOME GOOD OLD-FASHIONED AMERICAN XENOPHOBIA IN THE EARLY WAVES OF CHINESE IMMIGRATION IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTY S THE NEW CHINESE POPULATION WORKED MOSTLY AS MINERS AND FARMERS AND LABORERS AND AMERICANS AS EVER
POD0000000112_S0000184 ALL STUFFED FULL OF TINY STRIPS OF FORTUNE PAPER
POD0000000112_S0000196 WHEN I ASKED AROUND IT TURNS OUT A FEW OF MY FRIENDS DO THIS OR CAN RECITE THEIR FAVORITE FORTUNES FROM MEMORY AND IT'S CRAZY BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE FORTUNES ARE STEVEN'S
POD0000000112_S0000205 ACTUALLY CALLING THIS PLACE A FACTORY IS KIND OF AN OVERSTATEMENT
POD0000000112_S0000215 MING'S FATHER LATER DEVELOPED THE NEXT GENERATION OF FORTUNE COOKIE MACHINES
POD0000000112_S0000232 I WAS NINE YEARS OLD WHEN WE GOT SENT TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS
POD0000000112_S0000240 A MONTH FOR FOUR YEARS
POD0000000112_S0000249 FLOURISHED IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PIN THE AMERICANIZATION OF THE COOKIE TO ONE SPECIFIC JAPANESE-AMERICAN BAKER OR CHINESE-AMERICAN RESTAURANT
POD0000000120_S0000010 AND IT REALLY IS MASSIVE
POD0000000120_S0000019 THE DEMAND IS SO HIGH IT TAKES ALMOST EVERY BEEHIVE IN THE COUNTRY TO DO THE JOB
POD0000000120_S0000029 IT'S MOST OF HIS BUSINESS
POD0000000120_S0000059 TODAY IT'S WHAT WE'D CALL SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER BACK THEN A STANDARD PRESCRIPTION TO FIGHT DEPRESSION WOULD BE LAUDANUM
POD0000000120_S0000078 THEY CAN CHECK ON THEIR HEALTH
POD0000000120_S0000097 THERE WAS A NEED FOR GREATER CERTAINTY WHEN IT CAME TO POLLINATION
POD0000000120_S0000102 MANY FARMS CAME TO DEPEND ON THIS SINGLE DOMESTICATED SPECIES OF BEE AS FARMERS GREW MORE CROPS COMMERCIAL BEEKEEPERS STARTED EARNING MORE MONEY BY RENTING OUT THEIR BEES AS POLLINATORS
POD0000000120_S0000118 BUT HE'S RIGHT
POD0000000120_S0000125 THERE WERE STUDIES BY FREAKED OUT SCIENTISTS COLONY COLLAPSES WHEN ALL THE BEES IN A COLONY JUST DISAPPEAR IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS
POD0000000120_S0000142 OFTEN INFECTED WITH VIRUSES
POD0000000120_S0000150 VULNERABLE SPECIES OF INSECT
POD0000000120_S0000178 I THINK IT IS A GOOD THING BY CONSERVING OR BY TRYING TO HELP BEES WE'RE GENERALLY IMPROVING HABITAT PUTTING MORE FLOWERS IN
POD0000000120_S0000197 IF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BEES AND THE HEALTH OF BEE POPULATIONS WHAT CAN THEY DO
POD0000000120_S0000209 YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT ADAM'S SHOW IT'S CALLED THE BUSINESS OF BEES IT'S AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE YOU GET YOUR PODCAST
POD0000000128_S0000025 WOW SO THERE'S LIKE A HYPERLINK IN THE BOTTOM OF A LAKE
POD0000000128_S0000039 SO WHAT IN THE WORLD MADE ADMIRAL MOUNTBATTEN THINK THAT AN UNSINKABLE SHIP SHOULD BE MADE OF ICE
POD0000000128_S0000067 A WARSHIP YEAH FOR THE WAR
POD0000000128_S0000081 REACH US THROUGH THE CONTACT PAGE AT NINETY NINE PI DOT O R G
POD0000000128_S0000102 THAT THEY NOW HAD COMPLETE DOMINION OVER THE ANIMALS
POD0000000128_S0000132 BUT AS I WAS LOOKING INTO IT I THOUGHT THE IDEA SEEMED FAMILIAR SOMEHOW
POD0000000128_S0000150 AND FARMERS RE-USED LIVESTOCK FEED BAGS TOO
POD0000000128_S0000163 SHE ACTUALLY SAID THIS QUOTE THAT I REALLY LIKED
POD0000000128_S0000181 I DO ALL THE MUSIC COOL
POD0000000128_S0000205 WELL THERE WERE ACTUALLY A FAIR AMOUNT OF RECORDINGS WITH VIOLINS BUT IT WAS PART BECAUSE OF THE ENGINEER'S GOING THROUGH ALL THIS TROUBLE TO DO THESE ELABORATE SESSIONS
POD0000000128_S0000236 TO RECORD THEM AT ALL SO AFTER THEY WEREN'T NECESSARY BECAUSE RECORDING TECHNOLOGY HAD ADVANCED
POD0000000128_S0000256 AND IT WAS KIND OF THE PUNCHLINE OF THE TED TALK
POD0000000128_S0000264 WELL DONE POCATELLO
POD0000000136_S0000023 AND NOT JUST BIG FOR THE SAKE OF BIGNESS IT NEEDS TO STICK OUT AS SOMETHING OFF
POD0000000136_S0000029 YOU GET IT
POD0000000136_S0000037 HE SURRENDERED ONCE
POD0000000136_S0000044 SO LET'S THINK ABOUT MATERIAL FOR THIS IMAGINED PLAQUE
POD0000000136_S0000049 OR A GREAT PIGEON ALIT ON HIS BROWN-GREEN EPAULET AND I LIKE THAT THE GHERY OF IT ALL THE FUTURISM IS NOT AT ALL FUTURISTIC IT'S MILLENNIAL
POD0000000136_S0000059 THEY DON'T JUST APPEAR UPON DEATH
POD0000000136_S0000068 THEY FELT THE CITY NEEDED NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST RIGHT THEN BECAUSE THEY HAD SEEN THAT CITY FALL FROM GREAT HEIGHTS MEMPHIS HAD BEEN LEFT RELATIVELY UNSCATHED BY THE WAR
POD0000000136_S0000074 AND THEN THERE WAS THE YELLOW FEVER THAT HAD SWEPT THROUGH THE CITY SOME YEARS BEFORE AND KILLED SO MANY AND DROVE MANY MORE AWAY
POD0000000136_S0000079 WHITE BUSINESSES DID NOT LIKE COMPETING WITH BLACK BUSINESSES
POD0000000136_S0000085 AND THE PAPER SHE HAD WRITTEN FOR BURNED TO THE GROUND
POD0000000136_S0000091 A BLACKSMITH'S BOY WHO BECAME A MILLIONAIRE AND THEN BELIEVED SO STRONGLY IN THE CONFEDERATE CAUSE THAT HE ENLISTED AS A PRIVATE
POD0000000136_S0000096 EVEN IF IT WASN'T TECHNICALLY AMERICAN
POD0000000136_S0000102 THEY SAID NOTHING OF HOW NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST HAD BEEN THE FIRST GRAND WIZARD OF THE KU KLUX KLAN
POD0000000136_S0000109 KNEW ABOUT FORREST AND THE KLAN
POD0000000136_S0000118 THOUGH THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE BATTLE OF FORT PILLOW WHEN FORREST ORDERED THE MASSACRE OF HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN TROOPS ATTEMPTING TO SURRENDER
POD0000000136_S0000124 THERE IS DEBATE
POD0000000136_S0000132 MAY IT HAVE RUINED HIM
POD0000000136_S0000140 WHATEVER WAS IN THEIR HEARTS
POD0000000136_S0000146 TO STAND FOR WHAT THEY VALUED MOST
POD0000000136_S0000152 AND I WANT THEM TO KNOW WHY IT WAS MOVED
POD0000000144_S0000010 THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP ACTUALLY
POD0000000144_S0000024 IT WAS THE SIGHT OF ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE AND LEAST TOLD STORIES OF RESISTANCE TO SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES AFRICAN-AMERICANS SET UP COMMUNITIES IN THAT SWAMP
POD0000000144_S0000039 UNLIKE SOME OTHER RUNAWAYS WHO HEADED TO NORTHERN CITIES
POD0000000144_S0000052 LIKELY A FEW DOZEN PEOPLE ON EACH ONE WITH SOME MINGLING AND TRADE HAPPENING BETWEEN THE ISLANDS THAT WERE CLOSE TOGETHER
POD0000000144_S0000066 THE DISMAL SWAMP WAS HOME TO THOUSANDS OF SELF-SUFFICIENT MAROONS
POD0000000144_S0000087 SOME MAROONS LIVED IN THE WOODS LIKE THE WOMAN AND MAN DESCRIBED BY SMALLEY
POD0000000144_S0000099 THEY WANTED AUTONOMY
POD0000000144_S0000111 OF COURSE THEY USED SLAVE LABOR FOR ALL OF THIS
POD0000000144_S0000126 HE PICKED THE SWAMP
POD0000000144_S0000141 EVENTUALLY GRANDY RECOVERED AND WENT BACK TO WORK
POD0000000144_S0000156 NO ONE REALLY KNOWS FOR CERTAIN
POD0000000144_S0000164 A COMPLETE REJECTION OF WHITE SOCIETY
POD0000000144_S0000180 WE'LL SHARE A LITTLE GEM OF AN OUTTAKE FROM SHARIF'S RESEARCH OF THIS PIECE AFTER THIS
POD0000000152_S0000016 I EDITED ESSAYS AND INTERVIEWS LAID OUT ARTICLES AND TOOK A WEIRD AMOUNT OF PLEASURE IN TYPOGRAPHICAL MINUTIAE
POD0000000152_S0000024 I HAVE A DEGENERATIVE RETINAL DISEASE THAT'S GIVEN ME SEVERE TUNNEL VISION SO BASICALLY NO PERIPHERAL VISION
POD0000000152_S0000031 MY RETINAL SPECIALIST TOLD ME THAT I PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT LOSING THE ABILITY TO READ FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS OR SO
POD0000000152_S0000049 AFTER A LIFE SPENT LOVING BOOKS THERE'S NOW A REAL URGENCY FOR ME AND THE QUESTION OF HOW BLIND PEOPLE EXPERIENCE LITERATURE
POD0000000152_S0000068 THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN DUNCE CAPS AND GIANT FAKE GLASSES
POD0000000152_S0000085 THEY'RE FILLED WITH ORNATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY LETTER FORMS
POD0000000152_S0000092 THE DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL AT THE TIME LET A GROUP OF STUDENTS EXPERIMENT WITH THE EMBOSSED PAGES THAT THE CAPTAIN HAD LEFT BEHIND AND IN THAT GROUP WAS A TWELVE YEAR OLD BLIND KID NAMED LOUIS BRAILLE
POD0000000152_S0000100 DESIGNED BY A BLIND PERSON WHO UNDERSTOOD INTIMATELY THE NEEDS OF THOSE READING BY TOUCH
POD0000000152_S0000105 AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT BRAILLE WAS QUIETLY DEVELOPING HIS NEW READING SYSTEM
POD0000000152_S0000114 THEN HOWE'S SYSTEM IS SIMILAR BUT IT LOOKS MORE RUNIC TOLKIEN-Y
POD0000000152_S0000126 SO IT'S HARDER
POD0000000152_S0000138 AT THE MISSOURI SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND STUDENTS PASSED EACH OTHER NOTES AND REPORTEDLY EVEN LOVE LETTERS IN BRAILLE SINCE THEY KNEW THEIR TEACHERS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO READ THEM IF THEY GOT CAUGHT BUT HOWE HAD INVESTED A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME AND RESOURCES INTO DEVELOPING DISTRIBUTING AND PROMOTING BOSTON LINE TYPE
POD0000000152_S0000143 WHICH HOWE LEVERAGED TO MAKE BOSTON LINE TYPE ONE OF THE DOMINANT PRINT MEDIUMS FOR THE BLIND ACROSS THE U S LIKE HOWE MANY OF THE DIRECTORS AND FACULTY AT SCHOOLS FOR THE BLIND WERE SIGHTED
POD0000000152_S0000162 SO A WHOLE COTTAGE INDUSTRY AROSE WITH ALL SORTS OF COMPETING SYSTEMS
POD0000000152_S0000168 YOU KNOW
POD0000000152_S0000179 BLIND CHILDREN ARE STARTING TO BE MAINSTREAMED INTO PUBLIC SCHOOLS
POD0000000152_S0000189 THOSE PEOPLE WHO'D BECOME BLIND LATER IN LIFE HAD NEW OPTIONS
POD0000000152_S0000195 THEY CALLED THEM TALKING BOOKS
POD0000000152_S0000200 HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE THE ELEMENTS OF A CODEX WHICH IS A FANCY WORD FOR THE THING THAT WE USUALLY CALL A BOOK WITH PAPER PAGES INK AND BINDING
POD0000000152_S0000217 THEY WEREN'T LISTENING FOR SONIC AESTHETIC PLEASURE
POD0000000152_S0000234 THESE CRITICS BELIEVE THAT THE TRUSTY OLD TECHNOLOGY OF THE BOOK WILL ALWAYS BE THE SUPERIOR VEHICLE FOR IDEAS YOU CAN HEAR THIS CONSERVATISM AND CONDESCENSION NOT ONLY IN THOSE PEOPLE WHO MALIGN THE EBOOK
POD0000000152_S0000246 AND GOING BLIND WILL TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME
POD0000000152_S0000253 WITH AN OPTOPHONE
POD0000000152_S0000266 HIS COLLEAGUES CALLED HIM A CYBORG
POD0000000152_S0000275 HARVEY'S MISTAKE IN THE SEVEN ELEVEN SUGGESTS TO ME A WAY THAT MY FUTURE AS A BLIND READER MIGHT ACTUALLY SIGNAL SOMETHING OTHER THAN A TOTAL LOSS
POD0000000152_S0000280 WHICH GIVES ME HOPE THAT WHICHEVER WAY I END UP READING
POD0000000160_S0000015 LIKE IF THERE WAS A FUNICULAR TRANSPORT SUSPENDED FROM A BRIDGE OF SOARING TOWERS OVER THE BAY CONNECTING DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO TO OAKLAND AND THIS BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE A BLIMP THAT WOULD BE ATTACHED TO THE UNDERSIDE OF A BAY BRIDGE THAT WOULD APPARENTLY CROSS THE BAY IN FIVE MINUTES
POD0000000160_S0000026 OH PASHAW YOU SAY CONTEMPTUOUSLY
POD0000000160_S0000059 APRIL EIGHTEEN
POD0000000160_S0000066 BUT INSTANTLY THE PLAN UNRAVELED IT'S SOMETHING EVERY CITY RAVAGED BY DISASTER HAS SEEN
POD0000000160_S0000078 HIGH SPEED HANGING BULLETS OVER THE BAY AND A LOGICAL CITY THAT WE CAN HOLD IN OUR IMAGINATIONS AND CURSE OUR FOREBEARS FOR BEING SO SHORT-SIGHTED
POD0000000160_S0000086 THEY WERE PROPOSED HIGHWAY SYSTEMS THAT WOULD CARVE UP SAN FRANCISCO IN UNIMAGINABLE WAYS
POD0000000160_S0000093 OKAY SO FIRST WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT ROBERT MOSES
POD0000000160_S0000099 BUT SOME OF WHAT HE'S MOST FAMOUS
POD0000000160_S0000105 WHAT THOSE HIGHWAYS WOULD LOOK LIKE TODAY
POD0000000160_S0000110 AND A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY WANTED THEM
POD0000000160_S0000116 HE HAD DRIVERS WHO CARTED HIM AROUND AND ENDURED THE HORRIBLE NEW YORK TRAFFIC FOR HIM
POD0000000160_S0000125 BUT ON THE GROUND
POD0000000160_S0000148 FIND LIKE A HIGHWAY JUST STAND UNDER IT AND THEN COME HERE AND THEN TRY TO REMEMBER WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE
POD0000000160_S0000162 AS I WENT THROUGH CUTTING ACROSS MANHATTAN BEFORE I DREW IN THE HIGHWAY I JUST LOOKED AT THE SWATH THAT I HAD ERASED
POD0000000160_S0000169 SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE
POD0000000160_S0000176 AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA
POD0000000160_S0000187 SO THE GOLDEN GATE NATIONAL RECREATION AREA WAS FORMED OUT OF CONCERN FOR ALL THE VARIOUS PLANS THAT WERE BEING PROPOSED
POD0000000168_S0000015 WHICH IS WHERE REVEREND JOHN FIFE MET THEM AND THEY ASKED SOME OF US WHO WERE PASTORS TO PROVIDE SOME PASTORAL CARE FOR THE SURVIVORS WHO WERE TRAUMATIZED BEYOND UNDERSTANDING
POD0000000168_S0000031 SIMILAR CONFLICTS WERE UNFOLDING IN NICARAGUA AND GUATEMALA WHERE AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS WERE FACING PRESSURE FROM LEFT-WING REBELS THIS IS THE HISTORY REVEREND JOHN FIFE STARTED TO LEARN ABOUT WHEN HE MET THE SALVADORIAN MIGRANTS WHO'D NEARLY DIED IN THE DESERT NEAR TUCSON WELL BASICALLY THEY WERE TELLING ME WHY THEY'D FLED EL SALVADOR
POD0000000168_S0000042 REVEREND FIFE BEGAN TO SEE MORE AND MORE CENTRAL AMERICANS ARRIVING IN TUCSON
POD0000000168_S0000051 IF SOMEONE SHOWS UP IN THE U S AND THEY CAN MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO STAY
POD0000000168_S0000061 THE GOVERNMENT WAS MORE INCLINED TO SEE THEM AS ECONOMIC MIGRANTS AND ON TOP OF THAT THERE WAS THE COLD WAR
POD0000000168_S0000077 THAT MEANT THEY DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR ASYLUM
POD0000000168_S0000084 IN THAT SAME PERIOD THE APPROVAL RATE FOR IRANIANS WAS SIXTY PERCENT
POD0000000168_S0000097 MY RESPONSE WAS HOW THE HELL DO YOU FIGURE THAT JIM
POD0000000168_S0000104 JIM ARGUED THAT CHRISTIANS SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE TO PROTECT THEM AND HE SAID THEY
POD0000000168_S0000112 I WENT BACK TO THEM AND SAID YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT
POD0000000168_S0000119 SO ONCE AGAIN
POD0000000168_S0000125 THEY'D HELP THE REFUGEES STRATEGIZE ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT
POD0000000168_S0000132 MORE RECENTLY CHURCHES SHELTERED CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS DURING THE VIETNAM WAR BUT EVEN THOUGH REVEREND FIFE WAS DRAWING ON A LONG RELIGIOUS TRADITION HE AND HIS CONGREGANTS WERE STILL HARBORING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHO CROSSED INTO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND AS IT TURNS OUT
POD0000000168_S0000139 THEY HUNG TWO HUGE BANNERS ON THE FRONT OF THE CHURCH
POD0000000168_S0000144 THEY HELD A SERVICE AND PUBLICLY WELCOMED A NEW FAMILY FROM EL SALVADOR TO JOIN THE OTHER REFUGEES WHO WERE STAYING AT THE CHURCH
POD0000000168_S0000169 AND WITH HIM
POD0000000168_S0000185 FATHER ELFORD WAS VETTING THE FAMILY
POD0000000168_S0000191 HERE'S REVEREND FIFE AGAIN I WOULD JUST KIND OF SMILE AND SAY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CHURCH
POD0000000168_S0000197 AND WE WERE THROWN IN THE BACK
POD0000000168_S0000212 AND IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME JOHN WAS RIGHT IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
POD0000000168_S0000218 UNDERCOVER GOVERNMENT INFORMANTS INFILTRATE THE SANCTUARY MOVEMENT YEAH A COUPLE OF THESE GUYS I THOUGHT THEY DON'T FIT THE USUAL SANCTUARY VOLUNTEER PROFILE
POD0000000176_S0000018 AND THESE ARE BITS OF LAND CUT OFF FROM THEIR HOME COUNTRIES IN VARIOUS COOL WAYS YEAH AND THEY TAKE A LOT OF FORMS AND IT GETS COMPLICATED PRETTY FAST
POD0000000176_S0000051 CONSIDER COUNTER-COUNTER ENCLAVES
POD0000000176_S0000065 ON AN ISLAND IN A LAKE
POD0000000176_S0000088 IT'S JUST KIND OF THERE
POD0000000176_S0000096 BUT STILL THEY HAVE THESE PILLARS THERE REALLY ARE EVERYWHERE
POD0000000176_S0000116 BUT ALSO YOU HAVE THIS ENLIGHTENMENT IDEA THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF FIXED OBJECTIVE REALITY OUT THERE THAT WE HAVE BEEN DENIED ACCESS TO UP UNTIL NOW
POD0000000176_S0000138 THEN THEY WERE OFF TO THE RACES BECAUSE NOW YOU DON'T NEED TO PHYSICALLY MEASURE
POD0000000176_S0000152 AND THERE'S ACTUALLY HILARIOUS DESCRIPTIONS OF WHERE YOU COULD FIND THEM BECAUSE THEY'D BE LIKE OH ASK THE FARMER WHO LIVES AT THE END OF THE LANE AND HE'LL TELL YOU
POD0000000176_S0000163 HE WORKS FOR A WATER AND WASTE AUTHORITY IN EAST ANGLIA AND HE HONESTLY CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT COMPELLED HIM TO DO THIS
POD0000000176_S0000191 THIS IS AN ENGLISH ROSE
POD0000000176_S0000204 WOW THAT WAS MY REACTION AS WELL
POD0000000176_S0000226 OCCOQUAN NOPE
POD0000000176_S0000246 THE DIRECTION THIS IS GOING INDICATES TO ME THAT THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO BE GOING GREAT SOON

POD0000000200_S0000032 THEY WERE NOT CHURNING THE PAPER INTO PULP OR MELTING DOWN THE PLASTIC INTO PELLETS
POD0000000200_S0000039 WAITING TO ACCEPT OUR STUFF
POD0000000200_S0000044 HAD NO IDEA
POD0000000200_S0000063 WAS CHINA
POD0000000200_S0000070 CITIES COULD SUBSIDIZE THEIR RECYCLING PICKUP PROGRAMS FROM THE MONEY THEY MADE SELLING THESE MATERIALS TO CHINA

POD0000000200_S0000124 COUNTRIES LIKE VIETNAM AND MALAYSIA AND THAILAND
POD0000000200_S0000130 BECAUSE NOW THEY ARE GETTING SO INUNDATED WITH RECYCLABLES THAT THEY'RE INCREASINGLY PUTTING THEIR OWN RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT KINDS OF MATERIAL THEY ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT

POD0000000200_S0000158 BUT ALSO THE MRFS WANT US THE CONSUMERS TO SEND THEM CLEANER RECYCLING WHICH WOULD MAKE RECYCLING LESS EXPENSIVE AND MORE EFFICIENT FOR EVERYONE
POD0000000200_S0000171 ROBERT REED PULLED OUT A TOTALLY NORMAL LOOKING TUBE OF TOOTHPASTE

POD0000000208_S0000174 IN TERMS OF WATCHING CHICAGO'S WASTE IT'S MOSTLY A SYMBOLIC ISSUE
POD0000000208_S0000183 WE COULD GUIDE OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST TO ENGINEER THE IMPOSSIBLE NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES

POD0000000232_S0000119 IT'S LIKE MY FRIENDS AND I COULD HAVE JUST BOUGHT THIS BEER OFF EBAY AND ENJOYED IT ALMOST ANYWHERE AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BASICALLY THE SAME EXPERIENCE
POD0000000232_S0000133 AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER THE LIMITED SUPPLY OF WESTVLETEREN HAS CREATED A PRICY BLACK MARKET
POD0000000232_S0000145 I WANT TO PAY YOU
POD0000000240_S0000009 REAGAN WAS EULOGIZING THE REMAINS OF AN UNIDENTIFIED SERVICE MEMBER FROM THE VIETNAM WAR
POD0000000240_S0000022 JUST THAT ALTHOUGH THE PERSON BEING BURIED THAT DAY MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNKNOWN TO THE PUBLIC
POD0000000240_S0000027 AFTER THE CIVIL WAR
POD0000000240_S0000042 MARKED BY A CROSS BEARING THE NAME OF A REGIMENT
POD0000000240_S0000053 IT WAS AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS
POD0000000240_S0000062 SO INSTEAD OF SOLDIER OR SAILOR OR MARINE THEY'RE SIMPLY REFERRED TO AS THE UNKNOWN
POD0000000240_S0000071 EACH WAR WOULD GET THEIR OWN UNKNOWN WHICH MADE SENSE THERE WERE LOTS OF UNKNOWNS TO CHOOSE FROM
POD0000000240_S0000085 SO GROWING UP IN ST LOUIS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY S AND SEVENTY S
POD0000000240_S0000105 ONLY A FEW HAD GOTTEN HIT

POD0000000240_S0000139 SO THIS JUST ADDED TO THE CONFUSION OF THE BATTLE
POD0000000240_S0000150 AFTER THAT THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY WAY TO GET TO THE SITE OR FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
POD0000000240_S0000158 THEY PROCESSED IT BY GATHERING TOGETHER AT THE FUNERAL AND JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PERSON'S LIFE WHO THEY WERE HOW MUCH EVERYONE MISSED THEM
POD0000000240_S0000166 THEY LATER SEPARATED AND PATRICIA JOINED THE AIR FORCE EVENTUALLY ATTAINING THE RANK OF COLONEL
POD0000000240_S0000174 AND I AM A FORMER GREEN BERET
POD0000000240_S0000185 AND REMEMBER SHE HERSELF WAS IN THE AIR FORCE
POD0000000240_S0000190 AND THEY SAID BY NO MEANS IS THERE ANYTHING TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT YOUR BROTHER'S IN THE TOMB
POD0000000240_S0000202 MAYBE I SHOULD CHECK THIS OUT
POD0000000240_S0000211 ALMOST KIND OF EMBARRASSED
POD0000000240_S0000216 BUT I FINALLY SAID WHAT IF YOU COULD FIGURE OUT WHO THIS WAS

POD0000000240_S0000228 AND IF IT'S MICHAEL
POD0000000240_S0000235 AND I WAS ACTUALLY BACK IN DENVER AT THAT POINT SITTING IN THE NEWSROOM WHEN I OPENED IT UP AND I WAS PAGING THROUGH IT PAGE AFTER PAGE AND GOING OH MY GOD
POD0000000240_S0000248 THEN THE REQUEST WOULD HAVE NEVER COME AND I WOULD HAVE NEVER ACTED ON IT CHRIS TOOK THE MATTER TO HIS REGIMENTAL COMMANDER
POD0000000240_S0000255 IN A BLACK PLASTIC BAG
POD0000000240_S0000260 A PARACHUTE PART OF MICHAEL'S FLIGHT SHOOT
POD0000000240_S0000268 GET HIS BODY FROM THAT WRECKAGE
POD0000000240_S0000281 THE BLASSI FAMILY COULD NOT EVEN BE TOLD THAT ANY REMAINS HAD BEEN FOUND
POD0000000240_S0000292 THEY ALSO POINTED TO THE ARTIFACTS LIKE THE FLIGHT SUIT AND THE LIFE RAFT AND A RECORD OF THE MISSING WALLET
POD0000000240_S0000303 SHOWED THAT THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY MYSTERY AT ALL
POD0000000240_S0000310 PATRICIA WANTED TO GO PUBLIC WITH VINCE AND CBS
POD0000000240_S0000316 BUT THE TIE BREAKER WAS MICHAEL'S MOTHER
POD0000000240_S0000331 AND DAY OR TWO LATER

POD0000000248_S0000020 THE KEEPER OF THE NEON
POD0000000248_S0000047 THE NEON FLICKERS YEARS LATER TEN TWENTY YEARS DOWN THE ROAD
POD0000000248_S0000069 USUALLY IT'S SO CHEAP YOU CAN CHIP IT OFF WITH YOUR FINGERNAIL BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A SIGN OVER YOUR LOCAL BAR OR HOTEL OR SOMETIMES EVEN A NEON SIGN OVER A CHAIN STORE
POD0000000248_S0000088 HONG KONG IS LOSING A LOT OF ITS SPECTACULAR NEON DISPLAYS
POD0000000248_S0000093 TINGE WITH A BIT OF NOSTALGIA
POD0000000264_S0000026 AND THE CITY IN CHINA WHERE IT'S LOCATED
POD0000000264_S0000032 THE PROVINCE OF ZHEJIANG WHERE YIWU IS LOCATED
POD0000000264_S0000055 THE GOODS ARE DELIVERED TO MY WAREHOUSE
POD0000000264_S0000072 BY POURING MOLTEN METAL INTO A MACHINE THAT'S SETTING IT IN A MOLD
POD0000000264_S0000098 AND THEN YOU SEE WHY
POD0000000264_S0000105 SHE'S THERE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FROM SUNUP TO SUNDOWN
POD0000000264_S0000121 AND THEN NEW WAYS TO SURVIVE AS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CHANGES
POD0000000272_S0000016 SO IF SCIENCE EVER DISPROVES THIS IDEA OF TORONTO AS RACCOON NATION I REALLY FEAR FOR TORONTO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN IDENTITY CRISIS
POD0000000272_S0000022 WHICH THE CITY STARTED COLLECTING FOR THE RESIDENTS IN GREEN BINS SEVERAL YEARS AGO
POD0000000272_S0000027 LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW AND GO SHIT
POD0000000272_S0000048 THIS ALL STARTED THE WAY MOST THINGS START IN CITIES
POD0000000272_S0000055 HE WEARS SHIRTS WITH HIS COMPANY LOGO HE HAS A FIRM HANDSHAKE
POD0000000272_S0000076 REHRIG PACIFIC TOOK ALL OF THIS INFORMATION AND APPLIED IT TO THEIR BIN DESIGN
POD0000000272_S0000091 YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TURN IT IN A WAY THAT REALLY WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN IF YOU DON'T HAVE OPPOSABLE THUMBS AND CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF
POD0000000272_S0000096 IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE WERE AFRAID THAT WITHOUT THE GREEN BINS AS A FOOD SOURCE
POD0000000272_S0000102 AMY DECIDED TO LOOK INTO IT I WROTE A QUICK EMAIL TO SUZANNE MACDONALD OUR LOCAL RACCOON EXPERT AND I SAID
POD0000000272_S0000113 SHE ASKED HER

POD0000000272_S0000168 AND SHE JUST PULLS THE BIN DOWN LIKE
POD0000000272_S0000180 IT WENT VIRAL

POD0000000272_S0000211 SHE'S STUDIED RACCOONS INCITIES AND THEY ARE ON THE WHOLE
POD0000000280_S0000007 SHORT FOR VOICE OPERATING DEMONSTRATOR IT LOOKED SORT OF LIKE A FUTURISTIC CHURCH ORGAN THAT'S OUR OWN DELANEY HALL AN OPERATOR KNOWN AS A VODERETTE
POD0000000280_S0000026 PRODUCING THE MOST BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OF SPEECH
POD0000000280_S0000042 JAPAN LAUNCHED AN EARLY MORNING ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR IN HAWAII
POD0000000280_S0000055 IT WAS CALLED THE A THREE SCRAMBLER
POD0000000280_S0000066 IT ALL WENT BACK TO THE VODER
POD0000000280_S0000082 SO WHILE DON MEHL WAS DOWN IN THE BASEMENT RUNNING THE MACHINE
POD0000000280_S0000090 IN CRYPTOGRAPHY THESE RECORDS ARE WHAT'S KNOWN AS A ONE TIME KEY
POD0000000280_S0000100 SO THAT WE COULD SYNCHRONIZE OUR CONTROL CLOCKS EXACTLY THEN THEY GET THEIR IDENTICAL RECORDS SPINNING ON THEIR RESPECTIVE TURNTABLES AT EXACTLY THE SAME MOMENT
POD0000000280_S0000116 IT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO SUBTRACT THE NOISE IN THE SAME WAY THE SIGSALY ENGINEERS DID AT EACH END OF THE TRANSMISSION
POD0000000280_S0000137 BUT THE VOCODERS REACH ACTUALLY GOES WAY BEYOND THE ROBOT VOICE
POD0000000280_S0000150 IT HELPED THE ALLIES WIN THE BIGGEST WAR THE WORLD HAD EVER KNOWN
POD0000000288_S0000023 THERE IS NOTHING FUN GOING ON INSIDE WILL GRAHAM'S HEAD
POD0000000288_S0000039 I DON'T DIFFERENTIATE
POD0000000288_S0000052 ALMOST ALL THE SOUNDS IN HANNIBAL START OUT AS AN ACOUSTIC ELEMENT FROM BRIAN REITZELL'S WORKSHOP
POD0000000288_S0000067 THAT SOUND I KNEW IT WAS CIRCULAR WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY BUT WE KNEW THAT WAS RIGHT AND I TOOK WHAT DAVID SAID LITERALLY AND I GOT A BULLROARER
POD0000000288_S0000080 THIS IS SONG EXPLODER

POD0000000288_S0000125 DOGS AND BIRDS ON LAWNS
POD0000000288_S0000132 AND THEN YOU GO I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT CAME FROM
POD0000000288_S0000149 BUT HE WORKED WITH IT FOR A LITTLE BIT AND FIGURED IT OUT
POD0000000288_S0000165 THE CREW COMPARTMENT'S
POD0000000288_S0000188 IMPERCEPTIBLY
POD0000000288_S0000200 AND HE WAS LIKE GIVE IT TO ME AGAIN
POD0000000288_S0000211 AS PART OF HIS DRUM KIT I FORGOT TO MENTION HE HAS A PIECE OF RUSTY SHEET METAL
POD0000000288_S0000222 I DON'T PUBLICLY OUT MYSELF AS A UTOPIAN AND A PEOPLE-LOVER
POD0000000296_S0000016 SAYING THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS THEY DIDN'T DO A GOOD ENOUGH JOB PROMOTING IT AS AN ACTUAL SOUND MARK
POD0000000296_S0000026 ANYBODY WHO HEARD THAT IN THE FIFTY S OR SIXTY S WOULD INSTANTLY KNOW IT WAS NBC THE CHIMES WERE EVERYWHERE THEY WERE SO POPULAR THAT THEY EVEN APPEARED IN SOME POP SONGS
POD0000000296_S0000037 WHICH HAD THE SAME SOUND THAT WE KNOW TODAY JUST IN A DIFFERENT KEY
POD0000000296_S0000049 AGAIN JOHN SNYDER
POD0000000296_S0000062 IT WAS A BRAND WHOSE NAME YOU REMEMBERED
POD0000000296_S0000076 BUT THIS SOUND IS BIGGER THAN COMCAST OR NBC OR GENERAL ELECTRIC
POD0000000304_S0000017 YOUR WORN-IN BLUE JEANS
POD0000000304_S0000052 LET'S HOPE THAT THE WHEATON ESCALATOR DOESN'T CONVENIENTLY BECOME STAIRS ANYTIME SOON
POD0000000312_S0000015 THAT'S BECAUSE MY SOLAR PANELS CREATE MORE ENERGY THAN I CAN USE
POD0000000312_S0000020 BUT NOW IT IS
POD0000000312_S0000027 APPROPRIATELY
POD0000000312_S0000035 BESIDES BEING SOMETHING ON SATELLITES IN OUTER SPACE
POD0000000312_S0000053 BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE SUN'S NOT SHINING OR WHAT HAPPENS IF THE SUN IS SHINING AND THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON IN THE BUILDING
POD0000000312_S0000073 NO
POD0000000312_S0000087 BECAUSE BIG ESTABLISHED POWER PLANTS SELL POWER TO THE UTILITY COMPANIES AT A CHEAPER WHOLESALE COST
POD0000000312_S0000098 AT THE TIME
POD0000000312_S0000124 HILLARY CLINTON TALKS ABOUT IT WHEN SHE WENT TO NEVADA AND TALKED TO LOCAL NEWSPAPERS THERE THERE ARE FIGHTS IN IOWA TEXAS MAINE VERMONT NEW YORK UTAH HAWAII
POD0000000312_S0000142 USUALLY THAT'S AT NIGHT
POD0000000312_S0000158 SO IS IT NOT THEN BY EXTENSION ALSO KIND OF DUMB TO NOT VARY THE PRICE THAT WE'RE PAYING CUSTOMERS WHO ARE GENERATING SOLAR POWER FROM THEIR ROOFS
POD0000000312_S0000170 EVERY DAY THERE'D BE A DIFFERENT PRICE
POD0000000312_S0000185 AND THAT'S WHY EVEN JESSIKA TRANCIK THINKS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A CAP AND WHY DON KREIS WANTS THIS SORT OF DECLAWED VERSION OF THAT
POD0000000312_S0000199 NINETY NINE PERCENT INVISIBLE WAS PRODUCED THIS WEEK BY SAM EVANS-BROWN AND LOGAN SHANNON WITH HELP FROM MAUREEN MCMURRAY TAYLOR QUIMBY

POD0000000320_S0000040 ATARI BURIED THE UNSOLD GAME CARTRIDGES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT
POD0000000320_S0000046 THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S JUST NONSENSE SO HOWARD WAS A SKEPTIC
POD0000000320_S0000061 IN THE END THE EXCAVATION TEAM UNEARTHED A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT ATARI GAME CARTRIDGES
POD0000000320_S0000067 I'M OF THAT GENERATION MYSELF THIS IS ARTHUR DAEMMRICH

POD0000000320_S0000093 BUT KIDS GOT IT IMMEDIATELY
POD0000000320_S0000101 THEY BROUGHT THE EXCITEMENT OF THE ARCADE INTO THE SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM
POD0000000320_S0000106 AND HE WAS PRETTY GOOD AT HIS JOB I WAS PRETTY GOOD AT MY JOB
POD0000000320_S0000121 HOWARD SPENT EIGHT MONTHS WORKING ON RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK THE VIDEO GAME
POD0000000320_S0000132 WE WANT YOU TO MAKE E T THE VIDEO GAME
POD0000000320_S0000138 VIDEO GAMES AT THE TIME TOOK SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS TO CREATE
POD0000000320_S0000145 HOWARD GOT TO WORK
POD0000000320_S0000155 I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO IS TURN SLEEP INTO AN ASSET
POD0000000320_S0000164 THERE WAS ALMOST NO TIME LEFT TO MAKE THE GAME THAT NEVER LIKE OCCURRED TO ANYONE
POD0000000320_S0000173 SO
POD0000000320_S0000187 STEVEN SPIELBERG'S SOON-TO-BE CLASSIC MOVIE E T THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL IS OUT IN THEATERS

POD0000000320_S0000223 WHAT LOOKS LIKE A FOREST
POD0000000320_S0000234 RIGHT A VIDEO GAME MUST FRUSTRATE A USER
POD0000000320_S0000240 I FELL IN ANOTHER PIT TERRIBLE
POD0000000320_S0000249 YOU KNOW HOWARD
POD0000000320_S0000257 ATARI SOLD THEM TO A DISTRIBUTOR WHO PLACED THEM IN STORES BUT THE DISTRIBUTOR HAD THE FULL RIGHT OF RETURN OH SO THEY COULD RETURN THEIR STOCK TO ATARI
POD0000000320_S0000269 NO NEW GAME SYSTEMS WERE INTRODUCED AND HARDLY ANY NEW GAMES WERE CREATED AT ALL
POD0000000320_S0000286 AT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AMERICAN HISTORY
POD0000000320_S0000297 IT HINTS AT THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION THAT FOLLOWED
POD0000000320_S0000309 IN THAT MOMENT
POD0000000328_S0000009 FROM MILES AWAY YOU CAN SEE THE ENORMOUS WHITE CRANES THAT PULL GIANT UNIFORMLY-SIZED METAL BOXES OFF THE SHIPS
POD0000000328_S0000019 NOW VISIT THE HEART
POD0000000328_S0000032 AND THE GOODS THEMSELVES LITERALLY THE STUFF COMING FROM ALL THESE PLACES IS VISIBLE TO YOUR VIEW
POD0000000328_S0000041 THE CONTAINERS FULL OF STUFF COULD GO DIRECTLY FROM THE SHIP ONTO TRUCKS AND TRAINS
POD0000000328_S0000051 THEY HAD AN EFFECT ON PORT CITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD
POD0000000328_S0000059 THEY REALLY GET THEIR EXPLOSIVE GROWTH BECAUSE OF THE VIETNAM WAR SHIPPING THINGS FROM OAKLAND TO VIETNAM
POD0000000328_S0000071 WHAT THOSE PEOPLE DO AND WHETHER THEY WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD ONTO THEIR JOBS AS THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO CHANGE
POD0000000328_S0000081 YOU MEET A LOT OF TOUGH PEOPLE NEAR THE DOCKS
POD0000000328_S0000090 WHICH RAN AND STILL RUNS SHIPS FROM OAKLAND TO HAWAII AND BACK I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OVER THE YEARS TO ADVANCE TO THE CHIEF MATE'S POSITION AT MATSON
POD0000000328_S0000104 A DOWN-TO-EARTH GROUNDBREAKING WOMAN IN THE FIELD OF SHIPPING
POD0000000328_S0000116 THE MARINE EXCHANGE KNITS TOGETHER THE MANY DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE CURRENT MARITIME ECONOMY
POD0000000328_S0000131 A FEW DAYS LATER I WAS SITTING ACROSS FROM TED BLANCKENBURG IN A MESSY OFFICE INSIDE A MANUFACTURED BUILDING RIGHT AT THE FOOT OF THE BAY BRIDGE
POD0000000328_S0000138 HOPEFULLY OVER A COURSE TED WORKS FOR AMNAV
POD0000000328_S0000145 SO I STARTED WORKING THREE DAYS A WEEK THIS WAS THE BEST JOB I EVER HAD
POD0000000328_S0000156 MAERSK WHICH IS THE BIGGEST SHIPPING COMPANY IN THE WORLD THEY'RE DANISH
POD0000000328_S0000178 THE LOCAL COMPANIES HAVE RESPONDED WITH CONSOLIDATION THEMSELVES
POD0000000328_S0000183 EVERYBODY NEEDS SOME BIGGER ENTITY FOR PROTECTION
POD0000000328_S0000189 AND THE BLAST RADIUS COULD EXTEND FAR BEYOND THE WEST COAST PORTS
POD0000000328_S0000195 DOING THE WORK
POD0000000328_S0000202 HOW DOES THIS WORK GET ACCOMPLISHED
POD0000000328_S0000216 WE CRUISE PAST THE CAP PALLISER AND WILL SNUGGLES TO TUG UP AGAINST THE DOCK TO AWAIT ORDERS WAITING FOR THE CALL
POD0000000328_S0000225 WHAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT AT IS A HUGE AND HIGHLY DIVERSE SLICE OF THE WORKING CLASS
POD0000000328_S0000244 THE SHIP IS SO HUGE
POD0000000328_S0000263 THE WATER SIMPLY PARTS
POD0000000328_S0000277 SOON
POD0000000328_S0000283 AND THEY STILL ONLY HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME ABOUT FOUR DAYS
POD0000000328_S0000291 SO IMAGINE A MAP OF THE WORLD WITH LINES CONNECTING DIFFERENT PORTS
POD0000000328_S0000298 SWALLOWING UP OTHER TRADE ROUTES THE WAY IT PLAYED OUT IN THE US IS AT THE SAN PEDRO BAY
POD0000000328_S0000305 A BERKELEY EDUCATED LAWYER AND LOCAL POLYMATH WHO PUBLISHED THE CONTAINER GUIDE A WONDERFUL LITTLE BOOK ON THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY DISGUISED AS A DOCKSIDE COMPANION TO SPOTTING BOXES
POD0000000328_S0000310 THE COST OF CHOOSING ONE PORT OR ANOTHER ON THE WESTERN SEABOARD
POD0000000328_S0000324 BUT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SCALE UP THEIR EXPORTS
POD0000000328_S0000329 WHICH ARE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AGRICULTURAL REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY
POD0000000328_S0000334 THE EFFICIENCY OF GLOBAL SHIPPING ALLOWED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRONICS AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER STUFF IN CHINA
POD0000000336_S0000008 WORDS WERE HAD
POD0000000336_S0000015 RISTRAS OF DRIED CHILIS HANG FROM EVERY DOORWAY
POD0000000336_S0000028 AMIDST ALL THIS COLORADO TRASH-TALKING
POD0000000336_S0000042 MOSTLY ON SMALL FAMILY FARMS THAT REMAINED DEDICATED TO THIS ONE BELOVED CROP FOR GENERATIONS BUT DESPITE THESE GROWERS' PRIDE IN THEIR PEPPERS
POD0000000336_S0000051 HE ANSWERED
POD0000000336_S0000056 HELP WAS EASY
POD0000000336_S0000063 NATIONWIDE DEMAND FOR CHILI PEPPERS IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH
POD0000000336_S0000068 IT'S LIKE THE PERFECT STORM CAME TOGETHER WE HAD BAD WEATHER
POD0000000336_S0000074 THEY'D STILL HAVE A PROBLEM
POD0000000336_S0000081 THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN YEARS
POD0000000336_S0000091 AND SARAH POINTS OUT THAT THE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME TO THE US AND WENT INTO AGRICULTURE
POD0000000336_S0000097 SO WORKERS HAVE TO HUNCH OVER IN THE HOT SUN TO GET THEM
POD0000000336_S0000118 GLEN GENUINELY DOESN'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION NOR DO A LOT OF OTHER CHILI FARMERS BUT IF YOU'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO ALMOST EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY
POD0000000336_S0000129 NO EXTRA HELP REQUIRED
POD0000000336_S0000144 ANOTHER MACHINE THEY TESTED HAD THE OPPOSITE PROBLEM IT WAS A VERY GENTLE COMBING MECHANISM THROUGH THE PLANTS
POD0000000336_S0000153 THEY'RE ALL STILL HARVESTED BY HAND
POD0000000336_S0000163 TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
POD0000000336_S0000177 AND WHEN I VISITED HER IN LOS LUNAS IT WAS TIME FOR A FINAL TEST
POD0000000336_S0000189 IT WAS ATTACHED TO A TRACTOR WHOSE DRIVER MANEUVERED THE WHOLE SETUP INTO PLACE
POD0000000336_S0000196 AS IT MOVED ALONG I COULD SEE THE METAL BITS SPINNING AND KIND OF SHOOSHING UP EACH PLANT COAXING THE PEPPERS OFF AND CARRYING THEM UP ONTO TWO CONVEYOR BELTS AND INTO BUCKETS WAITING TO CATCH THE CHILIS
POD0000000336_S0000215 IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES IT NEW MEXICO CHILI
POD0000000336_S0000226 SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IS NOT THAT MUCH LABOR
POD0000000344_S0000006 HE'S DRESSED ALL IN BLACK BLACK BEANIE HAT BLACK GLOVES
POD0000000344_S0000013 HE'S IN
POD0000000344_S0000019 WE SAT IN A CONFERENCE ROOM AMONG PILES OF TENSION WRENCHES AND LOCK PICKS
POD0000000344_S0000028 WHERE YOU COULD PUT SOMETHING UNDER LOCK AND KEY A CHEST A SAFE YOUR HOME
POD0000000344_S0000033 WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET PERFECT SECURITY BACK
POD0000000344_S0000042 BUT ACTUALLY WEREN'T SERIOUSLY THE BEST YOU COULD DO WAS TRY TO CONFUSE AN INTRUDER INTO PICKING A FAKE LOCK BUT AS SOON AS THE REAL KEYHOLE WAS KNOWN
POD0000000344_S0000057 CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF THE BRITISH CROWN
POD0000000344_S0000065 YOU WOULD KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAD TRIED TO GET INTO IT
POD0000000344_S0000073 AND HE HAD TO TURN THE THING BACK IN AND SAY HE COULDN'T DO IT AND HE COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT ANYONE COULD DO IT
POD0000000344_S0000085 HE WOULD PICK IT UNTIL HE TRIPPED THE DETECTOR MECHANISM CAUSING THE LOCK TO SEIZE UP
POD0000000344_S0000094 THEY GAVE HOBBS A ROOM ABOVE THE STORE
POD0000000344_S0000102 THE BRAMAH LOCK HAD BEEN OPENED WHEN HOBBS OPENED THAT LOCK I SWEAR TO YOU THE WORLD CHANGED OVERNIGHT THE FEELING OF PERFECT SECURITY HAD EVAPORATED
POD0000000344_S0000118 THEY'RE MORE ABOUT HOW FAST YOU CAN BEAT THEM
POD0000000344_S0000128 THEY INSPIRE US TO TRUST EACH OTHER AND THAT'S WHY A FIFTEEN DOLLARS LOCK FROM YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE STORE WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE
POD0000000352_S0000026 FOR SOME REASON
POD0000000352_S0000034 THAT'S RIGHT
POD0000000352_S0000055 UM AND IT'S NOT THAT MY BEST GUESS IS MAYBE HE'S USING SOME SORT OF WEIRD AUDIO CODEC THAT INTERACTS STRANGELY WITH MY SYSTEM BUT I REALLY COULDN'T TELL YOU SO I DON'T KNOW
POD0000000352_S0000065 WITH EXACTLY THE SAME PODCAST THAT IS SO WEIRD
POD0000000352_S0000073 AH
POD0000000352_S0000082 BLUETOOTH PLUS CAR RADIO PLUS NINETY NINE PERCENT INVISIBLE CAUSES EVERYTHING TO BREAK
POD0000000352_S0000092 SO IT'S LIKE BECAUSE THE STEREO CAN ALSO DISPLAY THE NAME OF THE PODCAST THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT JUST THERE BEING A SYMBOL WHERE IT DOESN'T EXPECT THERE TO BE A SYMBOL WHERE IT BREAKS YEAH
POD0000000352_S0000110 OTHER SPECIAL CHARACTERS SHOULD BREAK THE CAR TOO
POD0000000352_S0000118 ANNA PHIA
POD0000000352_S0000126 SO THE FIRST FIRST PODCAST WE MADE IS CALLED
POD0000000352_S0000154 INTERESTING
POD0000000352_S0000175 LESS THAN THE SIDES OF A SQUARE CORRECT
POD0000000352_S0000189 ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RELATED
POD0000000352_S0000201 SO WHY IS THIS THE PODCAST I LIKE BECAUSE I LIKE ARGUING WITH YOU IT'S LIKE FOR FANS OF ARGUING WITH YOU YEAH
POD0000000352_S0000213 SO CLEARLY THIS CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD
POD0000000352_S0000221 IT BREAKS THE CAR
POD0000000352_S0000240 YOU CALLED JOHN MAZDA WE CALLED THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE RADIO
POD0000000352_S0000258 LOWERCASE I
POD0000000352_S0000274 KURT SAYS I HAVE A THEORY
POD0000000352_S0000288 AND HE SAID PERCENT I
POD0000000352_S0000294 SO PERCENT AND THEN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT LETTERS TELL IT TO DISPLAY INTEGERS IN A CERTAIN
POD0000000352_S0000300 IF KURT'S RIGHT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TEST THIS WITH OTHER COMMANDS AND THOSE SHOULD ALSO MESS UP THE CAR STEREO
POD0000000352_S0000313 IT ARRIVED ON A MONDAY
POD0000000352_S0000321 WELL
POD0000000352_S0000331 YOU KNOW WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DIAGNOSE THIS PROPERLY WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING ACCESS TO THE CODE AND YOU'D DONE EVERYTHING YOU COULD YOU MADE A BUNCH OF NONSENSE PODCASTS FOR NO REASON YOU TALKED TO SOMEBODY WHO WORKED AT A MAZDA DEALERSHIP AND ONE GUY AT WORK
POD0000000352_S0000349 AND HE TOLD US THAT HE WAS PRETTY SURE HE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON WHICH IS
POD0000000352_S0000357 AND TO THE RADIO
POD0000000352_S0000367 IF IT DOESN'T GET IT
POD0000000352_S0000376 LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE THEY FREAK OUT WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER
POD0000000352_S0000385 ANDREW KUKLEWICZ FROM PRX HAD A VERY SWEET IDEA
POD0000000352_S0000396 AND EVERYTHING'S WORKING FINE
POD0000000352_S0000427 YOU WOULD BE MARK
POD0000000352_S0000467 LESS THAN THE SIDES OF A SQUARE CORRECT
POD0000000360_S0000018 AND WHO THIS IS STILL TRUE
POD0000000360_S0000039 SO
POD0000000360_S0000048 HE SHOWED ME THE PROPOSAL
POD0000000360_S0000054 WHY FIVE YEARS YEAH I WONDERED THE SAME THING SO I CALLED UP LOU YOST
POD0000000360_S0000075 AND THERE HAS NEVER NEVER BEEN AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE SINCE THEN
POD0000000360_S0000086 MARK SANDMAN IS ANOTHER MUSICIAN WHO IS THE LEAD SINGER OF THE BAND MORPHINE
POD0000000360_S0000106 MARK SANDMAN WOULD HAVE FIT UNDER THE CATEGORY DISTINGUISHED CAREERS BY PRESENT OR FORMER RESIDENTS WHO HAVE ACHIEVED STATE OR NATIONAL FAME
POD0000000360_S0000122 AND NOT JUST THE LOCAL AUTHORITY RECOGNIZING THE NAME
POD0000000360_S0000147 ALSO A FEW DAYS AFTER I FIRST EMAILED THEM AND WHEN BACK ON GOOGLE MAPS
POD0000000360_S0000154 BUSTA RHYMES ISLAND WAS BACK ON THE MAP
POD0000000368_S0000034 BUT NOW HE'S BACK HOME HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE OF CALIFORNIA
POD0000000368_S0000048 THE VIDEO REINFORCED EVERYONE'S GREATEST FEAR ABOUT THE NEW BRAND
POD0000000368_S0000058 WE SHOULD BE SEARCHING FOR CREATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR FUNDING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA
POD0000000368_S0000066 AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS SEAL DATES BACK TO WHEN THE UNIVERSITY WAS FOUNDED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
POD0000000368_S0000090 THE MEANING IS ACCRUED OVER TIME THE NIKE SWOOSH
POD0000000368_S0000102 I'M FRUSTRATED TOO
POD0000000368_S0000108 THIS C LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE A CIRCLE INDICATING A LOADING BROWSER TAB OR SKYPE OPENING OR ANY OTHER NUMBER OF LOADING SCENARIOS ON A COMPUTER
POD0000000368_S0000115 HE'S NOW AN ART DIRECTOR AT APPLE AND HE ALSO RUNS HIS OWN DESIGN SHOP IN SAN FRANCISCO
POD0000000368_S0000128 I STILL THINK THE GRADIENT IS JUST NOT QUITE RIGHT BUT OVERALL AFTER TALKING TO VANESSA
POD0000000368_S0000140 IS TO SEE THE WORLD THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE HAD OUR KITCHEN RENOVATED HERE
POD0000000368_S0000150 IT'S PROBABLY STRICTLY SPEAKING TRUE
POD0000000368_S0000157 I DON'T LIKE IT THEREFORE IT MUST NOT BE GOOD SO I GET THAT
POD0000000368_S0000162 WE'RE NOT PART OF THAT WORLD
POD0000000368_S0000167 I THINK INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHICH TEND TO BE PRETTY CHANGE-AVERSE ANYWAY
POD0000000368_S0000179 I THINK IT SPEAKS WELL OF HIS CHARACTER THAT CHRISTOPHER REGRETS THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF HE SHOULD
POD0000000376_S0000019 EVERY CAMPAIGN HAS A TEAM OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF MAKING EVERY EVENT FIT THAT BRAND
POD0000000376_S0000029 SO YOU WANT LOCAL COLOR
POD0000000376_S0000043 THE ADVANCE TEAM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STAGING OF THE EVENT FROM THE FLOWERS TO THE BACKDROP
POD0000000376_S0000054 WELL SPIES I GUESS YOU COULD CALL THEM TO EVERY ONE OF THEIR OPPONENTS' EVENTS
POD0000000376_S0000070 THE PRESENCE THEY HAVE WITH EACH OTHER
POD0000000376_S0000079 AND THE BIGGEST SCREW-UPS SAYS SEATON
POD0000000376_S0000098 LET'S GET STARTED WE'RE ON OUR WAY
POD0000000376_S0000121 YOU LISTEN TO PAST EPISODES AND SUPPORT HER SHOW
POD0000000384_S0000018 YOUR SYMBOLISM HAS FAILED UNITED STATES FLAG DOESN'T SAY USA ACROSS THE FRONT BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS
POD0000000392_S0000024 TRYING ALL KINDS OF TRICKS TO GET FOOD TO LOOK GOOD FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WELL AFTER PHOTOGRAPHY WAS WIDELY ADOPTED
POD0000000392_S0000047 SHOWING ALL THAT GOES INTO MAKING THE FOOD
POD0000000392_S0000053 HE MADE THEM FEEL ACTUAL HUNGER WITH HIS IMAGES HIS REAL THING IS JUST FOOD IN ITSELF ITS ESSENCE IS REAL ESSENTIAL
POD0000000392_S0000064 THEY COULD GET THE EXACT SAME RESULTS OVER AND OVER WHICH MEANT FEWER TAKES WHICH MEANT LESS TIME AND LESS MONEY SPENT
POD0000000392_S0000083 RIGGERS TODAY USE LASERS AND SENSORS AND PREPROGRAMMED MOTORS AND DEPENDING ON THE SHOT OR THE RIG THERE CAN BE SOME INTENSE PHYSICS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
POD0000000392_S0000095 SO IT'S GOT TO DO ONE THING TO MAKE IT ALL WORTHWHILE
POD0000000400_S0000016 IT'S STILL USED EVERYWHERE AND IT'S CONSIDERED ONE OF THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE U S
POD0000000400_S0000025 AND WE DISCUSSED WITH HIM THE IDEA OF MAYBE WE COULD JUST DO SOMETHING ABSTRACT BECAUSE NO ONE HAD ANY IDEA OF A SYMBOL OF BANKING
POD0000000400_S0000033 AND THAT WAS THE IDEA ANYHOW THAT WE COULD DO THAT ESTABLISH SOMETHING THAT WAS BOLD AND THAT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS REPRESENTING THE BANK RIGHT
POD0000000400_S0000054 WITH A PIN IN HIS LAPEL WITH A SYMBOL ON IT
POD0000000400_S0000077 AND THE IDEA WAS COULD WE DO SOMETHING THAT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT IT'S PUBLIC TELEVISION
POD0000000400_S0000091 A GAMESMANSHIP IN THIS AT ALL
POD0000000400_S0000104 YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING FOR A SPORTS TEAM THAT WOULD BE QUITE DIFFERENT FOR SOMETHING YOU WOULD DO FOR A BANK FOR EXAMPLE
POD0000000400_S0000119 MAKING ABSTRACT MARKS BUT IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THE EXPOSURE
POD0000000400_S0000138 REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE AND WHAT THEY DO OBVIOUSLY
POD0000000400_S0000162 JUST DO IT
POD0000000408_S0000007 WAS SPIRITUALLY AS WELL AS POLITICALLY VIGOROUS IT ASPIRED TO A BELOVED COMMUNITY
POD0000000408_S0000013 IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO CREATING A MULTIRACIAL
POD0000000408_S0000023 KING FOR HIS PART WAS INTRIGUED BY HARDING'S WORK WITH THE MENNONITES
POD0000000408_S0000031 I HAD THE MARVELOUS FORTUNE
POD0000000408_S0000037 ALL KINDS OF CLASS
POD0000000408_S0000051 I HADN'T QUITE MADE THE CONNECTION THAT YOU ARE MAKING NOW WITH MY OWN THOUGHT BUT THAT'S WONDERFUL THAT'S WHY WE NEED EACH OTHER
POD0000000408_S0000057 OF MANY KINDS
POD0000000408_S0000062 IN A SENSE
POD0000000408_S0000069 WHAT IS OUR PURPOSE IN THIS WORLD
POD0000000408_S0000078 DEEPLY GROUNDED
POD0000000408_S0000083 BEAUTIFUL TERMINOLOGY WHEN HE SAID THAT WHAT HE WAS SEEKING FOR WAS NOT SIMPLY EQUALITY OR RIGHTS
POD0000000408_S0000088 THOSE PRACTICES
POD0000000408_S0000095 PEOPLE LIKE JIMMY BALDWIN AND OTHERS
POD0000000408_S0000108 MOST RIVETING AND INSTRUCTIVE FOR THE YOUNG AS VINCENT HARDING TOLD IT
POD0000000408_S0000122 NOT THE TV STARS
POD0000000408_S0000130 DO WE EXIST FOR SOME REASON OTHER THAN COMPETING WITH CHINA OR FINDING THE BEST POSSIBLE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES ARE THERE SOME THINGS THAT ARE EVEN DEEPER THAT WE ARE MEANT FOR MEANT TO BE
POD0000000408_S0000137 WAS WHEN
POD0000000408_S0000144 AND IT IS AMAZING WHAT PEOPLE DISCOVER OF THEMSELVES
POD0000000408_S0000158 IS ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MANY OF THE ELDERS THAT WE HAVE INTERVIEWED IN THE VETERANS PROJECT
POD0000000408_S0000166 MARRIED EVENTUALLY
POD0000000408_S0000171 SHE IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY ENCOURAGERS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THERE NOT TO BE SWEPT AWAY BY ALL OF THE TALK ABOUT THE END OF DETROIT
POD0000000408_S0000180 AND WHAT THEY NEEDED WERE AS HE PUT IT
POD0000000408_S0000196 AGAIN TO RECOGNIZE THAT TO DEVELOP THE BEST HUMANITY
POD0000000408_S0000201 HOW DO YOU DO THAT

POD0000000408_S0000243 MORE ABOUT LESSER-KNOWN VETERANS OF CIVIL RIGHTS VETERANS OF HOPE AS VINCENT HARDING CALLED THEM
POD0000000408_S0000260 HE WAS ALSO A CLOSE FRIEND AND OCCASIONAL SPEECHWRITER TO MARTIN LUTHER KING JR
POD0000000408_S0000268 TREMENDOUS CREATIVITY
POD0000000408_S0000279 THAT THERE IS SOMETHING NEGATIVE ABOUT THAT TERMINOLOGY BECAUSE IT ALWAYS SUGGESTS THAT SOMEBODY ELSE IS THE MAJORITY
POD0000000408_S0000294 WHATEVER YOU DO
POD0000000408_S0000304 SOMEONE WAS WRITING ABOUT THIS TERMINOLOGY THAT WE'VE TAKEN ABOUT A KUM BAH YA MOMENT
POD0000000408_S0000315 THE FIRST WEEK WAS THE WEEK IN WHICH
POD0000000408_S0000329 KUM BAH YA
POD0000000408_S0000334 COME BY HERE
POD0000000408_S0000349 AND PEOPLE COULD SEE THAT THEY WERE MOVING TOWARDS GOALS
POD0000000408_S0000355 ISSUE THAT
POD0000000408_S0000361 ARE OPERATING OUT OF A SENSE OF HOPE AND POSSIBILITY
POD0000000408_S0000370 THAT WE COULD SEE AND WE COULD IDENTIFY
POD0000000408_S0000376 FOCAL SITUATIONS
POD0000000408_S0000381 ITS OWN CONTROL
POD0000000408_S0000395 GREAT BENEFITS OF LIVING ALMOST TO MY EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY
POD0000000408_S0000403 BUT AT ONE POINT
POD0000000408_S0000409 AND WHAT I SAW WAS THAT THEY HAD THIS GREAT CAPACITY TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE BEING LOVED
POD0000000408_S0000417 FEEL THAT
POD0000000408_S0000424 BECAME THE CREATORS OF A NEW POSSIBILITY FOR THE WHOLE NATION
POD0000000408_S0000430 SEE IT WITH THOSE WHO ARE LOVING THEM INTO NEW POSSIBILITIES
POD0000000408_S0000435 YES

POD0000000408_S0000451 HELPING TO BUILD THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION FOR A LOVING WORLD
POD0000000416_S0000006 ALAN DIENSTAG HAS OBSERVED THE EARLY STAGES OF ALZHEIMER'S AS A TIME FOR GIVING MEMORIES AWAY RATHER THAN LOSING THEM
POD0000000416_S0000038 THAT WOULD BEST BE DONE BY THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW THEM BEST
POD0000000416_S0000058 I'M ALSO ENCOURAGING THEM IN WHATEVER WAY THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH
POD0000000416_S0000081 IF I ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING JUST IN YOUR HEAD
POD0000000416_S0000096 OR I WAS AFRAID THEY'D LOSE IT I THOUGHT THERE WAS CERTAINLY A GOOD CHANCE THEY'D LOSE IT
POD0000000416_S0000109 ABSOLUTELY AND IT'S NOT A FORM OF CONTROL THAT YOU CAN TAKE IF I SIT YOU DOWN AND I SAY WELL I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT I REMEMBER
POD0000000416_S0000127 AND THEN THE MAN NAMED SAUL WHO SAID
POD0000000416_S0000141 THAT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE ISOLATION IS
POD0000000416_S0000168 BUT IT'S HARD IT'S HARD BECAUSE THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU LOOK AND YOU JUST DON'T SEE YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING
POD0000000416_S0000186 FEELING IS THERE
POD0000000416_S0000194 WHERE THERE'S WISDOM

POD0000000416_S0000238 HE WAS AN EARLY PRACTITIONER TO INTEGRATE SUPPORT GROUPS INTO HIS WORK WITH ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS
POD0000000416_S0000246 THE TRIUMPH IS TEMPORARY IT IS OF THIS MOMENT BUT IT'S THE TRIUMPH OF LIFE OVER DEATH
POD0000000416_S0000264 IT'S REMARKABLE HOW IT READS
POD0000000416_S0000290 AND HERE WE ARE
POD0000000416_S0000304 YOU DO HEAR ABOUT HOW THIS IS THE DISEASE THAT PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES ARE MORE SCARED OF THAN ANYTHING ELSE THIS IS WHAT NO ONE WANTS TO HAPPEN TO THEM YEAH BUT YOU DON'T FEEL THAT WAY
POD0000000416_S0000326 SOME PEOPLE CALL THIS A DEMISE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
POD0000000416_S0000341 I REALIZE HOW UNGRATEFUL WE ARE
POD0000000416_S0000358 ALL OF IT
POD0000000416_S0000392 WHAT STARTED TO HAPPEN WAS THAT SHE WOULD GO AND SEE HIM AND THE FIRST THING SHE WOULD SAY WAS DO YOU REMEMBER WHO I AM
POD0000000416_S0000403 THAT YOU CAN HOLD ONTO THAT
POD0000000416_S0000418 OBLIVIO GATE
POD0000000416_S0000433 MUTUAL OF AMERICA IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING QUALITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO HELP YOU BUILD AND PRESERVE ASSETS FOR A FINANCIALLY SECURE FUTURE
POD0000000424_S0000009 WE ARE CATERING TO GENERATIONS OF ALL AGES WHO ARE SEEKING SPIRITUAL MEANING AND WHO ARE A LITTLE BURNT OUT AND TIRED BY CLICHE AND BY SOME OF THE RELIGIOUS OFFERINGS AND TRADITIONAL TRAPPINGS
POD0000000424_S0000021 AND THAT MEANS I WOULD GO AROUND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND PICK FLOWERS
POD0000000424_S0000031 MADE ITSELF FELT TO YOU AS YOU GOT OLDER
POD0000000424_S0000048 THE TWENTIETH CENTURY'S TERRIBLE CONVERGENCE OF
POD0000000424_S0000062 AND COMMITTING TO A PATH OF PERSISTENCE
POD0000000424_S0000073 IF YOU WERE AT ALL CONSCIOUS AT THAT TIME OF THIS PLANTING A CALLING IN YOU
POD0000000424_S0000082 I THINK THAT THAT WAS MY WAY OF ASKING THE QUESTIONS THAT I DARED NOT ASK ABOUT THE FACT THAT BY THE AGE OF THIRTEEN I KNEW WHO I WAS ATTRACTED TO
POD0000000424_S0000092 BUT I THINK THOSE YEARS PLANTED THE SEEDS FOR MY
POD0000000424_S0000104 AND THERE'S THIS ONE OPTION WHERE GOD'S GOING TO LOOK AT ME AND SAY
POD0000000424_S0000122 THAT WAS WHAT FIRST KEPT ME INTERESTED
POD0000000424_S0000139 SO I WENT RESEARCHING WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THIS RITUAL THIS TORAH SERVICE RITUAL
POD0000000424_S0000149 AND HOW WAS
POD0000000424_S0000165 I KNEW SHE WAS A WIDOW
POD0000000424_S0000182 WE CREATED LIBRARIES FROM OUR FIFTEEN YEAR ARCHIVE FOR BROWSING OR DEEP DIVING BY TOPIC FOR TEACHING AND REFLECTION AND CONVERSATION
POD0000000424_S0000191 HE ONCE MOVED AWAY FROM JUDAISM TOWARDS STORYTELLING THEATER AND DRAG
POD0000000424_S0000202 SO I FEEL A DEEP LOVE AND A DEEP SENSE OF HONORING THE LEGACY THAT I WAS BORN INTO AND THE RICHNESS THAT I'M SO PRIVILEGED TO HAVE INHERITED AND BEEN TAUGHT
POD0000000424_S0000224 OTHER
POD0000000424_S0000234 UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR LITURGY IS INDEED POETRY
POD0000000424_S0000252 THIS LINE OF HESCHEL IN A FREE SOCIETY SOME ARE GUILTY WHILE ALL ARE RESPONSIBLE
POD0000000424_S0000270 I THINK THE WORDS ARE
POD0000000424_S0000282 WHERE WE SOME OF US THINK THAT THERE IS ROOM HERE FOR CREATIVITY FOR SACRED METAPHOR AND CHANGE
POD0000000424_S0000290 EITHER
POD0000000424_S0000306 AND HOW IS THAT TRUE OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US AND HOW THAT IS TRUE IN SOME WAYS OF AMERICA AND HOW THE NARCISSISTIC
POD0000000424_S0000315 AND
POD0000000424_S0000323 A NEW
POD0000000424_S0000338 SO THAT I CAN BE THERE MORE AGILE AND HELPFUL WHEN MORE CONTENTIOUS MOMENTS HAPPEN THE MOMENT I TURN ON MY PHONE OR OPEN MY FRONT DOOR
POD0000000424_S0000363 AFTER THE ELECTION
POD0000000424_S0000377 NOT IN ANTI BUT IN FOR AND IN FAVOR OF ENLARGING OUR SENSE OF HUMAN RESPONSIBILITY
POD0000000424_S0000383 ISN'T CAST WIDE ENOUGH
POD0000000424_S0000399 IT FEELS LIKE THE CALL TO INVEST IN THE LOCAL COMMUNAL
POD0000000424_S0000418 AND IT'S NOT EVERYBODY'S CUP OF TEA
POD0000000424_S0000436 WORKING TO CREATE A FUTURE WHERE UNIVERSAL SPIRITUAL VALUES FORM THE FOUNDATION OF HOW WE CARE FOR OUR COMMON HOME HUMANITY UNITED
POD0000000432_S0000012 IT MEANS
POD0000000432_S0000020 TOGETHER WITH THE MUSICIAN VIJAY IYER
POD0000000432_S0000036 AND THEN YOUR FAMILY MOVED BACK TO LAGOS
POD0000000432_S0000057 WHEN I GAVE UP ON RELIGION
POD0000000432_S0000073 IT'S NOT ALWAYS HELPFUL IN ITS TOTALITY SIMPLY BECAUSE IT EMERGES OUT OF HUMAN PROCESSES AS WELL
POD0000000432_S0000079 THAT IF WE ARE TUNED IN WITH ENOUGH PRECISION
POD0000000432_S0000088 SWEDISH POET WHO'S ONE OF YOUR PORTS OF REFUGE
POD0000000432_S0000100 HE SEEMED TO HAVE UNUSUAL ACCESS TO THIS MEMBRANE BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND
POD0000000432_S0000110 A SEARING OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WAS ONLY ACHIEVED AT BY GREAT STRUGGLE I THINK THE BEST THING TO COMPARE HIM TO IS THE GREAT JAPANESE
POD0000000432_S0000122 I WONDER HOW YOU SENSE HE MIGHT BE SPEAKING OR WOULD SPEAK
POD0000000432_S0000138 EIGHT YEARS AND IN THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS SINCE I MOVED TO THIS COUNTRY
POD0000000432_S0000145 IF EVERYONE'S SO WOKE
POD0000000432_S0000162 BUT WHAT I LEARNED FROM HIM IS THAT
POD0000000432_S0000169 MAYBE YOU'RE CALLED ON TO EXPLORE THE IDEAS THAT NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS
POD0000000432_S0000184 THOUGH THERE IS MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT THING ABOUT MEMORY AND MACHINES I'M VERY AFRAID OF THE MACHINES
POD0000000432_S0000193 WHO'S KIN
POD0000000432_S0000202 BUT THIS IS NOT A STORY ABOUT COURAGE
POD0000000432_S0000208 BUT THIS IS NOT A STORY ABOUT BRAVERY
POD0000000432_S0000214 GASSAMA CROSSED THE MEDITERRANEAN IN A TINY BOAT THAT WAS SUPERHUMAN
POD0000000432_S0000220 THE HAND THAT GIVES
POD0000000432_S0000227 BECAUSE I WANTED TO THINK ABOUT THIS BEYOND
POD0000000432_S0000233 WHY IS THIS ENOUGH
POD0000000432_S0000242 AND IT'S THE TITLE OF YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY BOOK
POD0000000432_S0000249 TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS NOT EVIDENT WHAT'S NOT APPARENT
POD0000000432_S0000260 IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS FOR SURE MY MOST-USED EMOJI IS
POD0000000432_S0000272 AND I HAVE TO BE STRONG ON YOUR BEHALF AND VICE VERSA
POD0000000432_S0000281 QARRTSILUNI

POD0000000432_S0000297 WITH THE ST PAUL CHAMBER ORCHESTRA'S LIQUID MUSIC SERIES
POD0000000432_S0000310 BUT IT DOES NOT GET TO THAT
POD0000000432_S0000318 WHERE CONCENTRATION HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED
POD0000000432_S0000330 WHICH IS NOT A STOP SIGN BUT A
POD0000000432_S0000337 IS THAT THING WE DON'T HAVE A BETTER WORD FOR BEYOND POETRY
POD0000000432_S0000353 OF A BUS USED BY ICE TO TRANSPORT BABIES
POD0000000432_S0000359 WHERE YOU LOCK BABIES IN
POD0000000432_S0000372 ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE STATE
POD0000000432_S0000384 AND THAT WE DON'T PLACE OUR ENTIRE FAITH
POD0000000432_S0000392 THERE'S SO MUCH GOOD WORK FROM THE FIRST HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IN ALL THE ARTS INCREDIBLE STUFF THAT WILL LAST MILLENNIA
POD0000000432_S0000399 AND THAT'S THE BEST THING IT CAN BE
POD0000000432_S0000410 THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO NEED THE HOPE THAT I CAN CONVEY
POD0000000432_S0000415 AND MY HOPE IS THAT IF IT'S WRITTEN WELL
POD0000000432_S0000424 THE WORST IMPLIES NOT LIVING TO TELL THE TALE
POD0000000432_S0000433 WE HAVE NOT BEEN THROUGH THE WORST
POD0000000432_S0000439 ABOUT BEING HUMAN
POD0000000432_S0000451 THAT MAY BE THE
POD0000000432_S0000459 A FRANK CONFRONTATION WITH THE FACTS
POD0000000432_S0000465 EVERYBODY WHO KNEW YOU PERSONALLY WILL ALSO BE DEAD
POD0000000432_S0000472 ARGUING ON SOCIAL MEDIA
POD0000000432_S0000480 I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE ANYWHERE
POD0000000432_S0000486 THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A GRAND AND LARGE MEANING
POD0000000432_S0000491 OF THIS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL MOMENT
POD0000000432_S0000498 WHEN YOU'VE HAD
POD0000000432_S0000505 IN THEIR INSTANTANEOUS WAY CAN ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE
POD0000000432_S0000514 YOU ARE A HURRY THROUGH WHICH KNOWN AND STRANGE THINGS PASS
POD0000000432_S0000527 HIS BOOKS ARE BLIND SPOT
POD0000000440_S0000005 YOU'D BE LIKELY TO FIND WELL-WORN COPIES OF BOOKS BY WALLACE STEGNER OR DENISE LEVERTOV
POD0000000440_S0000014 AND SO THOSE TWO THINGS COME TOGETHER
POD0000000440_S0000028 A YOUNG PERSON TEENAGER
POD0000000440_S0000038 YOUNG
POD0000000440_S0000050 BUT I DID IT PRETTY MUCH ON MY OWN
POD0000000440_S0000060 AND I THINK A LOT OF IT WAS JUST KIND OF HAPPENSTANCE
POD0000000440_S0000068 AND I STARTED READING IT BECAUSE I HAD NO FRIENDS
POD0000000440_S0000079 SO
POD0000000440_S0000092 WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL STUDYING TO BE A PROFESSOR
POD0000000440_S0000108 AND THEN I WAS TEACHING
POD0000000440_S0000126 WHOSE FATHER WAS A PASTOR
POD0000000440_S0000152 WE SAW THE GLORY WITH OUR OWN EYES
POD0000000440_S0000163 I THINK IT'S
POD0000000440_S0000177 AND I'M
POD0000000440_S0000193 WE START OUT USING THEM
POD0000000440_S0000203 IS
POD0000000440_S0000217 IT'S TRUE ALSO THAT AS WE WATCH OUR CHILDREN ACQUIRE AND MASTER WORDS
POD0000000440_S0000223 IT'S ALSO ABOUT READING
POD0000000440_S0000233 BUT ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS FOR ME HAS BEEN
POD0000000440_S0000246 REVERSAL OF WHAT THEY'RE USED TO DOING
POD0000000440_S0000260 I DON'T I JUST NEED SOMETHING TO GIVE ME SOME DEFINITION
POD0000000440_S0000268 LET YOUR MIND STRETCH AROUND IT
POD0000000440_S0000284 HIS LITERARY BIBLICAL IMAGINATION HAS FORMED GENERATIONS OF PASTORS TEACHERS AND LAY SEEKERS
POD0000000440_S0000296 DO PSALMS
POD0000000440_S0000307 THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
POD0000000440_S0000321 AND
POD0000000440_S0000329 THAT THE PSALMS TRAIN US IN HONEST PRAYER YEAH IMMERSE US AS YOU SAY IN THE STREAM OF LIFE AS IT IS WET AND WILD
POD0000000440_S0000339 ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION IS ABSOLUTELY AT THE HEART OF
POD0000000440_S0000344 IT'S BEEN PRACTICED DEALT WITH BY PEOPLE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
POD0000000440_S0000355 I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE AWARE OF THIS TOO THAT AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IN HISTORY
POD0000000440_S0000362 TO FIND A LANGUAGE OF HATE
POD0000000440_S0000370 SO
POD0000000440_S0000377 HUMAN BEINGS IN THE WORLD ISN'T IT
POD0000000440_S0000391 AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE MOMENT WE INHABIT I THINK EVEN GLOBALLY
POD0000000440_S0000396 AND THE WRITERS THAT USE WRITING AS A WAY OF CONVEYING TRUTH RATHER THAN JUST ENTERTAINING PEOPLE
POD0000000440_S0000408 YEAH AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT THINK OF CHARLES DINKENS AS CHRISTIAN READING
POD0000000440_S0000418 I GUESS WE READ STEGNER'S BOOKS

POD0000000448_S0000089 I'VE BEEN CHANGED I AM NOT THE SAME PERSON THAT I WAS
POD0000000448_S0000098 SO IT MAKES SENSE TO US I THINK
POD0000000448_S0000109 AND YOU TRANSMIT IT IN THE FORM THAT YOU HAVE IT
POD0000000448_S0000116 AND THE CHILD IS FORCED TO MAKE AN ADAPTATION TO THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT
POD0000000448_S0000129 MORE VULNERABLE
POD0000000448_S0000142 WE DID
POD0000000448_S0000149 BUT FOR SOMEBODY TO BE PREGNANT AND IN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER WHILE THOSE BUILDINGS ARE COMING DOWN THAT'S YOUR OWN PERSONAL HOLOCAUST
POD0000000448_S0000163 SHE HAS PIONEERED STUDIES WITH THE CHILDREN OF TRAUMA SURVIVORS AND HELPED DEMONSTRATE HOW EXPERIENCES CAN TRANSMIT A BIOLOGICAL VULNERABILITY TO STRESS IN FUTURE GENERATIONS
POD0000000448_S0000182 IT OPENS UP A NEW VOCABULARY FOR TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT
POD0000000448_S0000198 THEY START AT A CERTAIN TIME THEY END AT A CERTAIN TIME
POD0000000448_S0000208 BUT THEY'RE MERELY EFFECTS YOU CANNOT RUN FROM YOUR PAST
POD0000000448_S0000218 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THIS SCIENCE IS SAYING IS THAT SOMEHOW IN THE PROCESS OF HEALING AND ADDRESSING THAT IN A NEW WAY
POD0000000448_S0000231 I THINK THAT THE PODIUM OF SUFFERING PROVIDES AN UNPARALLELED OPPORTUNITY
POD0000000448_S0000238 TODAY WITH NEUROSCIENTIST AND EPIGENETICIST RACHEL YEHUDA
POD0000000448_S0000249 THIS EVENT DERAILED ME WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE WHO EXPERIENCED THE SAME EVENT WASN'T DERAILED BY THE EVENT
POD0000000448_S0000262 THE REASON THAT THAT STUDY WAS SO PIVOTAL EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO AS COMPREHENSIVE A BIOLOGIC ASSESSMENT AS WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO IN ADULTS
POD0000000448_S0000273 AND IT REALLY WORKED NOW I DIDN'T SAY THAT
POD0000000448_S0000287 WELL I HAVE DEPRESSION
POD0000000448_S0000298 AND OF COURSE NOT EVERY ILLNESS IS TREATED VERY EASILY
POD0000000448_S0000310 BELIEVES THAT THE SAME PERSON WHO WROTE LAMENTATIONS ALSO WROTE THE SONG OF SONGS
POD0000000448_S0000337 IT BOILS DOWN TO BEING ABLE TO ASK SOMEONE YOU OK
POD0000000448_S0000354 WHAT I'M ALWAYS STRUCK WITH IS HOW UPSETTING IT IS WHEN OTHER PEOPLE DON'T HELP OR DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE OR RESPOND VERY POORLY TO NEEDS OR DISTRESS
POD0000000448_S0000367 SUPPORTING ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND CIVIL DIALOGUE ON THE DEEPEST AND MOST PERPLEXING QUESTIONS FACING HUMANKIND WHO ARE WE WHY ARE WE HERE
POD0000000456_S0000023 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT AND THIS IS ON BEING
POD0000000456_S0000029 WE BEGIN WITH CHRISTINA TORRES MY NAME IS CHRISTINA TORRES AND I'M ORIGINALLY FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT I NOW LIVE IN HONOLULU HAWAII CHRISTINA IS MANY THINGS A TEACHER A WRITER A MEXIPINA
POD0000000456_S0000046 IT WAS REALLY HARD TO BE ANGRY AT MY BODY IN THE SAME WAY
POD0000000456_S0000057 I THINK I NEARLY THREW UP
POD0000000456_S0000067 HE'S ALSO A STRATEGIST FOR THE TED PRIZE MY IDEAL RUNNING IS RUNNING WITH OTHER PEOPLE RUNNING WITH A PARTNER IN PARTICULAR
POD0000000456_S0000085 AND ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT IS WITH HER
POD0000000456_S0000096 ASHLEY HICKS FOUND THAT IN RUNNING
POD0000000456_S0000123 I WOULDN'T SEE MY KIDS AS MUCH AS I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO
POD0000000456_S0000132 AND I BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT MY RUNNING LIFE AND MY MEDITATING LIFE WERE BEGINNING TO MERGE
POD0000000456_S0000149 SO I WAS WALKING AROUND IN THE D C HEAT ALL DURING THE DAY AND TRYING NOT TO SWEAT AND LOOK UNAPPEALING
POD0000000456_S0000162 WITH SOME REALLY SERIOUS CARDIAC LIMITATIONS
POD0000000456_S0000170 CATHARTIC IN THAT SENSE
POD0000000456_S0000193 I ALMOST ALWAYS CAME IN LAST ON MY TEAM NOT USUALLY LAST IN THE WHOLE MEET BUT DEFINITELY IN THE BACK OF THE PACK
POD0000000456_S0000202 AND THEN I PRAY
POD0000000456_S0000212 AND THAT'S AN OFTEN-RE-OCCURRING THOUGHT FOR ME ON RUNS
POD0000000456_S0000220 THEY HELD THESE TRACK MEETS FOR KIDS AGES THREE TO THIRTEEN
POD0000000456_S0000227 BUT I JUST KEPT FOCUSED ON MY GOAL WHICH WAS RUNNING TOWARD MY MOM
POD0000000456_S0000235 AND SO WHEN SHE PASSED AWAY I REALLY FELT LIKE I HAD LOST ALL CONTROL
POD0000000456_S0000245 I WAS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON STAYING STRONG AND STAYING HEALTHY THAN I WAS ON LOSING WEIGHT AND IT WASN'T ALWAYS EASY
POD0000000456_S0000256 SIKHISM SEES THE WORLD AS TRUTH
POD0000000456_S0000271 I AM MORE LIKELY TO SAY AND DO THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE OF THIS DAILY PRACTICE OF RUNNING
POD0000000456_S0000278 CLIMBING UP CLIFFS RUNNING THROUGH MUD AND SNOW
POD0000000456_S0000293 I KNEW THAT HE HADN'T BROUGHT ME THIS FAR TO SEE ME FAIL NOW AND THAT
POD0000000456_S0000301 BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A COLLECTION OF ARTICLES
POD0000000456_S0000308 AND I THOUGHT IF I WAS CHOSEN BY THE GODS
POD0000000456_S0000316 FOOTBALL HURT BUT I RAN
POD0000000456_S0000324 THE LITTLE INDIAN BOYS LINED UP WE GO INTO THIS WHITE COMMUNITY
POD0000000456_S0000334 THEN I GET TO HIGH SCHOOL
POD0000000456_S0000341 ONE OF YOU COULD BECOME A GREAT ATHLETE
POD0000000456_S0000348 WAS UNDEFEATED THE REST OF MY HIGH SCHOOL CAREER
POD0000000456_S0000356 I WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN PLESSY VS FERGUSON
POD0000000456_S0000362 IN CONFLICT FOR EQUALITY
POD0000000456_S0000368 THREE YEARS IN A ROW
POD0000000456_S0000377 FORMED A WORD THE ENERGY OF THE MOVEMENT
POD0000000456_S0000382 LOVING
POD0000000456_S0000387 TEN THOUSAND METER RUN
POD0000000456_S0000393 TRADITION SPIRITUALITY
POD0000000456_S0000398 WOULD GIVE ME A CLARITY OF MIND
POD0000000456_S0000404 I WANTED TO TRY TO GET A WORLD RECORD
POD0000000456_S0000410 TO BE ON A HEALING JOURNEY
POD0000000456_S0000416 SO NOW WE'RE IN TOKYO JAPAN
POD0000000456_S0000423 I FEEL LIKE I'M TWELVE YARDS BEHIND
POD0000000456_S0000429 OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE
POD0000000456_S0000434 IT WAS WINGS OF AN EAGLE
POD0000000456_S0000440 I FELT THE TAPE BREAK ACROSS MY CHEST
POD0000000456_S0000447 HE SAYS
POD0000000456_S0000466 FIND COOL ON APPLE PODCASTS OR WHEREVER YOU DOWNLOAD YOUR FAVORITE SHOWS
POD0000000464_S0000004 INCLUDING MILITARY VETERANS BUT MATTHEW SANFORD HAS WISDOM FOR US ALL ON THE STRENGTH AND GRACE OF OUR BODIES
POD0000000464_S0000019 HERE HE READS A PASSAGE FROM THAT IN PRINCIPLE
POD0000000464_S0000024 WE ARE ALL LEAVING OUR BODIES THIS IS THE INEVITABLE ARC OF LIVING
POD0000000464_S0000029 IT DOES REQUIRE HOWEVER THAT I SEEK MORE PROFOUNDLY WITHIN MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND DO SO WITH AN OPEN MIND
POD0000000464_S0000050 RIGHT AWAY
POD0000000464_S0000066 I NEEDED TO HAVE ALL MY AGES
POD0000000464_S0000073 A MALE NURSE TELLS ME THAT CHICKS ARE GOING TO DIG IT
POD0000000464_S0000079 MOST OF THEM ARE OLDER THEIR DYSFUNCTION BROUGHT ON BY AGE
POD0000000464_S0000085 I AM AGING MUCH TOO QUICKLY
POD0000000464_S0000098 AND I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED THOSE CONNECTIONS
POD0000000464_S0000108 I DON'T HEAR IT AT ALL
POD0000000464_S0000120 IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE LOOSE
POD0000000464_S0000138 AND THOSE SENSATIONS LISTENING TO MY OWN EXPERIENCE
POD0000000464_S0000145 AND THEN FOR ME WITH MY PARTICULAR INJURY BEING A MIND-BODY INJURY AT CORE
POD0000000464_S0000153 TODAY THE BODY'S GRACE I'M WITH YOGA TEACHER MATTHEW SANFORD
POD0000000464_S0000158 YOGA BECAME A WAY TO DELVE INTO THE INNER SILENCE HE DISCOVERED AFTER HE BECAME PARAPLEGIC
POD0000000464_S0000168 YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN YOU'RE WASHING YOUR DISHES FOR ANOTHER DAY AFTER ANOTHER MEAL AND YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF QUIET FEELING
POD0000000464_S0000173 YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LEARN TO SOFTEN YOUR ORGANS OF PERCEPTION LET'S SAY IF I'D ASK YOU RIGHT NOW TO SOFTEN THE INSIDE OF YOUR MOUTH AND IN PARTICULAR RELAX YOUR TONGUE
POD0000000464_S0000180 THAT WE NEED TO MANAGE BETTER WE NEED TO BE MORE PRESENT WITH FOR A LOT OF REASONS BECAUSE I THINK THIS SAME SILENCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BOTH CONNECTS US TO OTHER PEOPLE AND SEPARATES
POD0000000464_S0000188 YOU TRY TO MAKE WHAT I WOULD SAY THE SILENCE CONGRUENT WITH PHYSICAL EXERTION
POD0000000464_S0000197 AND START TO LISTEN AND TO BE QUIET
POD0000000464_S0000205 USUALLY THERE'S ENOUGH LIGHT TO GET ACROSS THE ROOM
POD0000000464_S0000212 MY REHABILITATION MADE A MISTAKE WITH THE SILENCE BY FOCUSING ON THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT
POD0000000464_S0000218 STOP MOVING
POD0000000464_S0000223 AFTER A WHILE THE MOON MAY COME OUT
POD0000000464_S0000243 BECAUSE I HAD A LOT OF THINGS
POD0000000464_S0000250 MY LUNG WAS COLLAPSING I HAD TROUBLE BREATHING I CAN FEEL THAT ANGST
POD0000000464_S0000256 AND I COMPARE IT TO AN ARTICHOKE YOU TAKE AN ARTICHOKE AND YOU PULL
POD0000000464_S0000262 I'M GETTING A GLIMPSE INTO A LEVEL OF EXISTENCE THAT WE HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING
POD0000000464_S0000271 BUT IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED BECAUSE I COULD ONLY DO AND STARTED OFF WITH A FEW POSES
POD0000000464_S0000279 RELIEF AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE FALLING EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE JUST LAYING THERE YOU KEEP FALLING CAUSE YOU'RE SO TIRED
POD0000000464_S0000286 HE NEEDS BOUNDARY AROUND HIS EXPERIENCE
POD0000000464_S0000303 THIS PROGRAM COMES TO YOU FROM APM
POD0000000464_S0000312 IT'S ALSO A REFLECTION ON DEEPER LESSONS MATTHEW SANFORD'S LIFE HAS FOR OUR LARGER CULTURE
POD0000000464_S0000318 IF WE CAN SEE DEATH AS MORE THAN BLACK AND WHITE
POD0000000464_S0000323 HOW ABOUT THE DAY YOU REALIZED YOU WEREN'T GOING TO BE AN ASTRONAUT OR THE QUEEN OF SHEBA
POD0000000464_S0000328 THE SILENCE THAT SURROUNDS THE LOSS OF INNOCENCE IS A MOST SERIOUS DEATH
POD0000000464_S0000334 WE ARE INTEGRATING DEATH
POD0000000464_S0000347 BUT YOU NEED ALL KINDS OF STRENGTH
POD0000000464_S0000359 THAT MAKES YOU FEEL A TYPE OF CONTROL OVER THE WORLD
POD0000000464_S0000370 WHETHER IT BE NATURE WHETHER IT BE EACH OTHER
POD0000000464_S0000378 THE THINGS THAT SOME OF MY STUDENTS ALREADY DO JUST TO LIVE THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE ARE THEMSELVES MIRACULOUS SOLUTIONS TO A MIND-BODY PROBLEM
POD0000000464_S0000388 AND WHEN YOU'RE PART OF THE WORLD
POD0000000464_S0000400 LITERALLY GROW GET TALLER
POD0000000464_S0000412 YOU KNOW BUT WHEN SOMEONE TELLS ME THAT I CAN'T CALL MYSELF DISABLED OR A PARAPLEGIC OR SOMETHING OR WHATEVER THE WORD MAY BE
POD0000000464_S0000422 I DON'T BUT AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000000464_S0000428 YOU FEEL A FREE THROW
POD0000000464_S0000434 I THINK MY MIND-BODY RELATIONSHIP CONTINUES TO HEAL
POD0000000464_S0000441 RIGHT AND SO I PRACTICE YOGA NOT JUST TO BECOME LIKE REALLY GREAT AT YOGA POSES I PRACTICE YOGA TO FEEL THIS UM YOU SAY AT ONE POINT IN YOUR MEMOIR THAT YOU COMPLETELY DISAGREE WHEN PEOPLE SAY MY BODY IS FAILING ME
POD0000000464_S0000451 AND MANY BONES BROKEN
POD0000000464_S0000457 IT MIGHT GET CONFUSED
POD0000000464_S0000466 YOU ARE TRYING TO GET LIFE FORCE THROUGH THE SPACES YOU CAN'T FEEL
POD0000000464_S0000473 THEY'RE NOT LOST THEY'RE NOT ABSENCE THEY'RE PART OF YOUR STRENGTH OF YOUR FIBER
POD0000000464_S0000478 AND SO THE WORLD GETS LIGHTER AND EASIER WHEN YOU INCLUDE MORE OF YOURSELF HERE
POD0000000464_S0000484 NO IT'S WORK LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE
POD0000000464_S0000492 ARE YOU LEAVING HERE
POD0000000464_S0000505 THERE IS ONE STORY THAT IT WAS A RELAY RACE AT LIKE HIS NURSERY SCHOOL OR PRESCHOOL
POD0000000464_S0000511 AND SO HE KNOWS THAT I CAN'T DO ALL THE THINGS
POD0000000464_S0000517 HE'S THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF MIND BODY SOLUTIONS IN MINNETONKA MINNESOTA
POD0000000464_S0000528 THIS PROGRAM IS PRODUCED BY CHRIS HEAGLE NANCY ROSENBAUM SUSAN LEEM AND STEFNI BELL
POD0000000472_S0000015 WHEREAS I THINK IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW POWERFUL LOVE IS YOU MIGHT TRY
POD0000000472_S0000022 HELEN FISHER REVEALS HOW WE CAN TAKE THIS KNOWLEDGE AS A FORM OF POWER FOR GIVING CONSCIOUS NEW MEANING TO THE THRILLING AND SOMETIMES TREACHEROUS HUMAN REALMS OF LOVE AND SEX I'M KRISTA TIPPETT AND THIS IS ON BEING
POD0000000472_S0000035 AND THAT WAS IT
POD0000000472_S0000053 AS OPPOSED TO WHY WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT
POD0000000472_S0000065 THAT STATE COMMONLY KNOWN AS BEING IN LOVE IS A KIND OF MADNESS
POD0000000472_S0000073 IT IS NEVERTHELESS THE STATE THE HUMAN BEING YEARNS FOR ABOVE ALL
POD0000000472_S0000102 OK WELL
POD0000000472_S0000121 AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT
POD0000000472_S0000135 EVEN THIS ROMANCE PIECE SEEMS TO HAPPEN COLLECTIVELY IN GROUPS
POD0000000472_S0000162 PEOPLE FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS WENT INTO RELATIONSHIPS EVEN ON THE FIRST DATE
POD0000000472_S0000171 AND SHE'S FROM ECUADOR
POD0000000472_S0000197 UP UNTIL THE EARLY LATE NINETEENTH EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY WAS IT SOMETHING LIKE THE AVERAGE MARRIAGE LASTED FOR SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE LIFE SPANS WERE SO DIFFERENT
POD0000000472_S0000209 AND THESE DAYS IT ENDS BECAUSE SOMEBODY DIVORCES
POD0000000472_S0000224 CAN YOU TELL ME
POD0000000472_S0000234 THE MORE WE KNOW
POD0000000472_S0000242 IN SOME FORM
POD0000000472_S0000256 HELEN FISHER
POD0000000472_S0000265 IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET ATTACHED TO SOMEBODY
POD0000000472_S0000284 RIGHT BECAUSE THEY ADMIRE ATTACHMENT
POD0000000472_S0000300 AND THEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE ALL LIVING LONGER
POD0000000472_S0000315 THEY'RE VERY IN FAVOR OF LIVING TOGETHER
POD0000000472_S0000329 THERE'S NEVER BEEN SO MANY THERAPIES
POD0000000472_S0000346 AND I HAVE THEN MADE TWO VERY LONG
POD0000000472_S0000352 ALL OF THESE THINGS YOU KNOW THROUGH YOUR SCIENCE THROUGH YOUR WORK
POD0000000472_S0000359 I KNOW A LOT ABOUT LOVE
POD0000000472_S0000382 WELL FIRST OF ALL
POD0000000472_S0000390 THEY NEED EACH OTHER TO GET AHEAD
POD0000000472_S0000396 THEY WANT MORE PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF AFFECTION
POD0000000472_S0000405 I SAID I BET ALL THREE OF YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE MAN IN YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW WHO WOULD MARRY YOU WITHIN A WEEK
POD0000000472_S0000414 BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO COME TO LEARN THAT MEN ARE JUST AS ROMANTIC AS WOMEN AND THAT WOMEN ARE JUST AS SEXUAL AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO CAST AWAY THESE BELIEFS THAT MEN ARE JUST FOOLS
POD0000000472_S0000427 MOVING FORWARD
POD0000000472_S0000434 AND THERE WAS NO WAY THAT HELEN FISHER WAS EVER GOING TO PUT A MOVE ON HIM NEVER
POD0000000472_S0000441 HE DOESN'T KNOW HE NEVER KNEW
POD0000000472_S0000452 AND JUST GIVING HIM THE TIME HE NEEDS WITH OTHER PEOPLE NOT BEING ALL UPSET IF I DON'T HEAR FROM HIM
POD0000000472_S0000475 SOMEBODY GAVE THAT TO SOMEBODY
POD0000000472_S0000481 SHE'S ALSO THE CHIEF SCIENTIFIC ADVISOR TO THE INTERNET DATING SITE MATCH DOT COM
POD0000000480_S0000006 IN HIS WRITING AND IN HIS LIFE HE EXPLORES HAPPINESS NOT AS A PLEASURABLE FEELING BUT AS HUMAN FLOURISHING
POD0000000480_S0000015 WE DON'T SIT FOR TWENTY MINUTES TO CULTIVATE COMPASSION IF WE WERE TO DO SO
POD0000000480_S0000024 HE BEGAN HIS PROFESSIONAL LIFE AT THE CELLULAR GENETICS LABORATORY OF A NOBEL PRIZE-WINNING BIOLOGIST AT THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE IN PARIS
POD0000000480_S0000045 SO WHILE HE WAS DOING THE CIRCUMNAVIGATION HE WAS ALSO READING BOOKS ABOUT HINDUISM SUFISM
POD0000000480_S0000062 BUT THERE WAS A COMMON QUALITY THAT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH INNER STRENGTH
POD0000000480_S0000078 PAINTERS ORDINARY FOLKS
POD0000000480_S0000102 IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES HE'S JUST SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY GOOD HUMAN BEING
POD0000000480_S0000112 ASKED BY HIS FATHER AS THE DIALOGUE OPENS WHY HE LEFT HIS PROMISING SCIENTIFIC CAREER FOR A BUDDHIST PATH
POD0000000480_S0000121 YOU ABANDONED YOUR CAREER IN ORDER TO COMMIT YOURSELF COMPLETELY TO BUDDHIST PRACTICE AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE FELT
POD0000000480_S0000132 WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD OF PHENOMENA THE WORLD THAT WE SEE AS REAL ALL AROUND US
POD0000000480_S0000139 YOU CHANGE CLOTHES YOU MOVE FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER
POD0000000480_S0000146 FORTUNATELY
POD0000000480_S0000159 SO WHEN THEY SAW THAT SOME OF THEM GOT THE IDEA OF CREATING THAT MIND AND LIFE INSTITUTE FRANCISCO VARELA A GREAT NEUROSCIENTIST ADAM ENGLE
POD0000000480_S0000174 ALL THIS IS VERY NICE BUT WHAT CAN WE CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY
POD0000000480_S0000181 A CAPACITY KNOWN AS NEUROPLASTICITY
POD0000000480_S0000194 IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THERE'S A PHYSICAL CORRELATE
POD0000000480_S0000199 WELL YOU SEE FIRST OF ALL
POD0000000480_S0000210 WHAT ABOUT FOCUSED ATTENTION
POD0000000480_S0000223 WHAT WE BASICALLY CALL THE THIRD-PERSON APPROACH MEANS LOOKING FROM THE OUTSIDE
POD0000000480_S0000229 SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THEIR BRAIN
POD0000000480_S0000235 FEEL LOVE
POD0000000480_S0000241 THERE WAS NO SCIENCE WITHOUT EXPERIENCE
POD0000000480_S0000248 IT'S LIKE A TORCHLIGHT A LIGHT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE THINGS BUT LIGHT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL THING THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
POD0000000480_S0000265 TRAINED AS A SCIENTIST AND BECAME A TIBETAN BUDDHIST MONK
POD0000000480_S0000277 RELATED TO INTERDEPENDENCE AND IMPERMANENCE
POD0000000480_S0000286 RELATIONS CO-DEFINE AN OBJECT
POD0000000480_S0000294 AND THAT HAS PROFOUND REPERCUSSIONS IN BUDDHISM
POD0000000480_S0000303 BUT THAT LEADS TO ALSO THE SENSE OF
POD0000000480_S0000311 AND EVERYONE WILL BECOME HAPPY IN THEIR OWN BUBBLE AND THEN THE WORLD WILL BE FINE WELL
POD0000000480_S0000326 ONCE IT'S DELICIOUS
POD0000000480_S0000337 WITH ALTRUISM
POD0000000480_S0000344 IF YOU ARE UNDER THE GRIP OF HATRED YOU ARE NOT FREE YOU ARE THE SLAVE OF YOUR OWN THOUGHTS
POD0000000480_S0000350 WE CALL THAT MENTAL TOXINS
POD0000000480_S0000361 I MEAN IT'S INFINITELY DESIRABLE THAT WE PROVIDE TO OTHERS AND TO OURSELVES
POD0000000480_S0000371 WHICH WE DON'T DO
POD0000000480_S0000382 NEITHER FOR HATRED NEITHER FOR ARROGANCE
POD0000000480_S0000388 SO THE MORE YOU WILL BRING BENEVOLENCE IN YOUR MIND AT EVERY OF THOSE MOMENTS THERE'S NO SPACE FOR HATRED THAT'S JUST VERY SIMPLE BUT WE DON'T DO THAT
POD0000000480_S0000394 FIRST IDENTIFIED THEN CULTIVATED
POD0000000480_S0000401 SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUALITIES OF HUMAN BEINGS WILL BE OPTIMAL JUST BECAUSE YOU WISH SO
POD0000000480_S0000406 NOW LAST WEEK HE RAN THE MONTREAL MARATHON AT SIXTY THREE
POD0000000480_S0000422 AND NOBODY IS FED BY THAT
POD0000000480_S0000429 AND SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SAID AND I HEAR THIS ALSO IN CONVERSATIONS I HAVE THAT WE MIGHT BE ON THE CUSP OF SOME KIND OF SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION
POD0000000480_S0000443 WITH PRECISELY THIS INTERDEPENDENCE AND THIS GLOBALITY
POD0000000480_S0000453 IT HAS NOW TO BE CONCERNED FOR ALL THAT LIVES
POD0000000480_S0000486 THEN FIVE MINUTES LATER ANOTHER PERSON CAME
POD0000000480_S0000500 OUR FUNDING PARTNERS INCLUDE THE JOHN TEMPLETON FOUNDATION THE FETZER INSTITUTE
POD0000000488_S0000021 AS IT BEGINS HE IS A PANICKED DISHEVELED AND UNSMILING ADOLESCENT
POD0000000488_S0000036 SOUNDS LIKE YOU OFTEN WERE GETTING INTO FIGHTS
POD0000000488_S0000044 AND JUST WALKED UP TO ME AND LITERALLY SLAPPED ME
POD0000000488_S0000059 THEY ARE REGRETTING SOMETHING THEY DID YESTERDAY OR WORRYING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TOMORROW SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY AT THE MAGIC SHOW TO BEGIN WITH
POD0000000488_S0000071 THE INTERACTION IS DIFFERENT
POD0000000488_S0000090 WHAT SHE TAUGHT ME TRULY REWIRED MY BRAIN
POD0000000488_S0000099 WHEN I MET HER
POD0000000488_S0000108 WHO ALSO DIRECTS STANFORD'S CENTER FOR COMPASSION AND ALTRUISM RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
POD0000000488_S0000116 THAT PART OF YOUR CORTEX STARTS BEING STIMULATED
POD0000000488_S0000134 AND HE TOLD THESE MONKS THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE STUDYING COMPASSION
POD0000000488_S0000144 AND THE HEART WILL COMPEL US TO GO OUTWARD AND CONNECT WITH OTHERS
POD0000000488_S0000160 BECAUSE WHEN YOU CONNECT WITH OTHERS AND YOU HAVE AN OPEN HEART
POD0000000488_S0000168 BY THE NATURE OF THE BAGGAGE THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
POD0000000488_S0000174 IT DOES GIVE YOU A SENSE OF BEING SAFE BUT IT ALSO KEEPS YOU CHRONICALLY ON PINS AND NEEDLES
POD0000000488_S0000183 AS WE CAN WHERE WE CAN
POD0000000488_S0000195 IS TO SEE OURSELVES AND THE WORLD WITH GREATER CLARITY
POD0000000488_S0000203 AND WHERE ARE WE GOING
POD0000000488_S0000213 THAT THEY'RE DOING STUDIES NOW PRACTICING COMPASSION AND ACTUALLY SEEING THE AMYGDALA SHRINK
POD0000000488_S0000224 IT'S JUST WHICH EXERCISE YOU'RE GOING TO DO
POD0000000488_S0000233 UNFORTUNATELY
POD0000000488_S0000247 IT ALMOST SEEMS AS THOUGH IT SHOULD NEVER OCCUR
POD0000000488_S0000264 WELL I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT
POD0000000488_S0000273 YOU CAN SEE EFFECTS IN REGARD TO THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE
POD0000000488_S0000290 WHO ALSO DIRECTS STANFORD'S CENTER FOR COMPASSION AND ALTRUISM RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
POD0000000488_S0000302 A DIFFERENT WORLD AND HOW THEY DO IN FACT HAVE POTENTIAL YOU DON'T WRITE THEM OFF AS A GANG MEMBER
POD0000000488_S0000310 AND THEY'RE JUST LOOKING FOR THAT PERSON WHO WILL
POD0000000488_S0000326 ONE OF THE TENDENCIES ALSO TO REVERT BACK TO OUR BASE BEHAVIOR WHEN WE FEEL THREAT
POD0000000488_S0000339 I THINK ANYONE WHO HAS LIVED A LIFE
POD0000000488_S0000346 IT IS HARD SOMETIMES
POD0000000488_S0000359 WHERE YOU CAN GIVE PEOPLE THIS GIFT OF CONNECTION
POD0000000488_S0000379 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE WITH PHYSICIANS IS THAT WHEN THEY HAVE A HOPELESS CASE OR A TERMINAL CASE AND OFTENTIMES ACTUALLY NEUROSURGEONS ONCE THAT REALITY IS EVIDENT
POD0000000488_S0000389 IMPROVE THE LIFE OF AT LEAST ONE PERSON
POD0000000488_S0000396 THEY'RE MANY MANY TIMES MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOR THEMSELF
POD0000000488_S0000407 THIS INTERACTION WITH THIS WOMAN RUTH DID NOT CHANGE MY LIFE CIRCUMSTANCE
POD0000000488_S0000414 HOW DO YOU SEE THAT MANIFESTING
POD0000000488_S0000424 AS WE MANIFEST THESE LITTLE POCKETS OF COMPASSION AND CARING FOR THE OTHER OCCURRING
POD0000000488_S0000434 SUPPORTING ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND CIVIL DIALOGUE ON THE DEEPEST AND MOST PERPLEXING QUESTIONS FACING HUMANKIND WHO ARE WE WHY ARE WE HERE AND WHERE ARE WE GOING
POD0000000496_S0000009 PSYCHIATRIST ELISABETH KUBLER-ROSS THEORIZED THERE ARE STAGES TOWARDS THE ACCEPTANCE OF DEATH
POD0000000496_S0000016 FOR EXAMPLE THE OPEN SOCIETY INSTITUTE OF PHILANTHROPIST GEORGE SOROS RECENTLY CONCLUDED A FAR-FLUNG THREE-YEAR PROJECT ON DEATH IN AMERICA
POD0000000496_S0000021 SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTY S SHE'S DEVOTED HERSELF TO COMPASSIONATE CARE AT THE END OF LIFE
POD0000000496_S0000026 I BEGAN OUR CONVERSATION BY ASKING JOAN HALIFAX HOW SHE CAME TO BE IN HER OWN WORDS
POD0000000496_S0000034 SO THAT WAS YOU KNOW ONE PART OF THE BEGINNING FOR ME
POD0000000496_S0000042 NOT ONLY IN DIRECT CARE OF DYING PEOPLE AND OF THEIR COMMUNITIES OF THEIR FAMILIES
POD0000000496_S0000049 SO OUR WORLDVIEW IN RELATION TO OUR VIEW OF WHAT IS DEATH
POD0000000496_S0000055 THEN WE WILL APPROACH DEATH WITH
POD0000000496_S0000060 ON THE OTHER HAND
POD0000000496_S0000065 AND THIS IS TRUE I THINK IN MANY RELIGIONS
POD0000000496_S0000070 AND OF COURSE THE HOSPICE MOVEMENT WHICH
POD0000000496_S0000078 OF COURSE HAS MANY ANTECEDENTS BUT TO LAND IT IN THE MIDDLE OF MEDICINE WAS EXTRAORDINARY
POD0000000496_S0000084 BUT TO GIVE SUCH DEEP CARE THROUGH MODERN PHARMACOLOGY AND THROUGH ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES AND AS WELL THROUGH PRESENCE AND COMPASSION
POD0000000496_S0000095 I ASKED HER HOW SUCH CULTURES CONTRAST WITH A MEDICAL VIEW OF DEATH AS SOMETHING TO FIGHT
POD0000000496_S0000101 THE DEEP RESPECT FOR THE ELDERLY
POD0000000496_S0000108 WHICH IS IN A WAY WHAT HEAVEN IS
POD0000000496_S0000115 YOU'VE EVEN PARTICIPATED IN EVENTS THAT INTEREST ME VERY MUCH ON
POD0000000496_S0000128 AND I HAVE HEARD SOME STORIES TO THE CONTRARY AS WELL I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS ALWAYS THE CASE
POD0000000496_S0000134 WHAT QUESTIONS ARE PEOPLE POSING WHO ARE CLOSE TO DEATH WHAT DO THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT
POD0000000496_S0000142 WHY ME
POD0000000496_S0000148 KNOWING THERE IS NO GOOD ANSWER BUT SEEING IF YOU CAN LOOK PAST THE NEED FOR AN ANSWER TO A DEEPER TRUTH
POD0000000496_S0000154 AND WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS BECOME OF THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
POD0000000496_S0000159 AND CEAS'D THE MOMENT LIFE APPEAR'D
POD0000000496_S0000164 HAS ANY ONE SUPPOSED IT LUCKY TO BE BORN
POD0000000496_S0000169 NO TWO ALIKE AND EVERY ONE GOOD
POD0000000496_S0000174 WE'RE SPEAKING WITH JOAN HALIFAX ABOUT HER INSIGHTS INTO THE EXPERIENCE OF DEATH AFTER DECADES OF WORK WITH DYING PEOPLE AND THEIR CAREGIVERS
POD0000000496_S0000182 AND SO FOR ME MERCY IS A COMBINATION OF SPIRITUALITY AND PRACTICALITY
POD0000000496_S0000188 THAT'S HAPPENING
POD0000000496_S0000195 I THINK YOU'RE ALSO SAYING THAT YOU ALSO HAVE SOME KIND OF FAITH THAT THERE'S A CONSCIOUSNESS
POD0000000496_S0000202 AND THEY BROUGHT THEIR DYING PROCESS
POD0000000496_S0000209 THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EDUCATION THAT'S HAPPENED FOR ALL OF US AROUND THE EXPERIENCE BOTH OF MARGINALIZATION AND ALSO A BREAKTHROUGH INTO A QUALITY OF DEEP ACCEPTANCE THROUGH THE GIFT OF THESE MEN TEACHING US SO
POD0000000496_S0000218 I WILL TELL YOU SOMETIMES IT WAS REALLY HARD TO SEE AND TO BE WITH THE DEGREE OF PHYSICAL CHALLENGE
POD0000000496_S0000225 CHRONICLING HER BROTHER'S DEATH FROM AIDS AT THE AGE OF TWENTY EIGHT
POD0000000496_S0000230 AND I SAID
POD0000000496_S0000235 AND HE SAID
POD0000000496_S0000241 I MEAN KNOW THAT YOU ARE
POD0000000496_S0000259 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT STAY WITH US SPEAKING OF FAITH COMES TO YOU FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA
POD0000000496_S0000267 SHE FOUNDED A PROJECT CALLED BEING WITH DYING AND HAS WORKED WITH PRISONERS ON DEATH ROW AS WELL AS PEOPLE FACING FATAL ILLNESS
POD0000000496_S0000272 ORDERS NOT TO RESUSCITATE IN CASE OF CARDIAC ARREST FOR EXAMPLE IF ONE IS ALREADY TERMINALLY ILL
POD0000000496_S0000278 YOU KNOW THESE CHOICES THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO MAKE AND MAYBE THERE'S SOME AWARENESS THAT'S INCREASING OF THAT
POD0000000496_S0000286 AND THE ANSWER IS PLANS
POD0000000496_S0000296 I GOT TO BE RESUSCITATED
POD0000000496_S0000302 WE DON'T
POD0000000496_S0000310 IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WORKING IN A WAY AS A COMPASSIONATE STRANGER WHICH IS AN EASIER ROLE
POD0000000496_S0000316 THE TRUTH IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE AN ACTIVELY DYING PERSON IN YOUR MIDST
POD0000000496_S0000322 NO
POD0000000496_S0000329 OH I JUST DO THE BEST I CAN
POD0000000496_S0000334 I'M AROUND A LOT OF SUFFERING
POD0000000496_S0000340 AND I STILL FEEL THAT I AM IN THE PRESENCE OF A MYSTERY
POD0000000496_S0000351 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT AND THIS IS SPEAKING OF FAITH FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA
POD0000000496_S0000356 YES I HAVE
POD0000000496_S0000363 SEE I MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN PAIN AND SUFFERING BY THE WAY OK WHAT'S THAT
POD0000000496_S0000370 BUT IF I'M NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO DISCOVER SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR
POD0000000496_S0000375 BUT I HAD TOLD HER AND HER PARTNER
POD0000000496_S0000381 BUT IT'S A KIND OF AMBIVALENT SITUATION
POD0000000496_S0000386 WHILE DEATH IS THE ULTIMATE LIBERATION
POD0000000496_S0000391 AND AS IT TURNED OUT IN THE CASE OF THIS PARTICULAR WOMAN
POD0000000496_S0000400 SO MANY PEOPLE LOVE YOU
POD0000000496_S0000405 AND TWENTY EXHALATIONS LATER I FELT WE WERE BOTH PASSING THROUGH THE DOOR TOGETHER
POD0000000496_S0000411 IT'S REALLY AN ISSUE OF THE HEART
POD0000000496_S0000421 WELL I LIVE IN A MONASTERY SO I DIDN'T HAVE YOU KNOW AS MUCH EXPOSURE TO THE MEDIA
POD0000000496_S0000430 AND
POD0000000496_S0000437 WHICH IS A WAKE-UP CALL REALLY FOR ALL OF US
POD0000000496_S0000447 THIS WEEK OUR WEB SITE INCLUDES EXCLUSIVE AUDIO OF A CONVERSATION WITH DR RICHARD PAYNE OF DUKE UNIVERSITY
POD0000000496_S0000455 THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF SPEAKING OF FAITH IS BILL BUZENBERG
POD0000000504_S0000017 WHAT IS THE RESONANCE BETWEEN HAPPINESS AND VIRTUE
POD0000000504_S0000026 MONKS SAT ON CUSHIONS ALONGSIDE AN INCANDESCENTLY LIT STAGE
POD0000000504_S0000031 YOUR HOLINESS

POD0000000504_S0000044 SOME PROBLEM
POD0000000504_S0000067 SITUATION
POD0000000504_S0000076 THEN YOU MAY NOTICE A CERTAIN PERIOD MY SADNESS
POD0000000504_S0000088 IT IS TRUE THAT IF YOU READ THE JEWISH LITERATURE AND YOU READ JEWISH HISTORY
POD0000000504_S0000096 HAS LIVED A STORY THAT I RESONATE WITH THE STORY OF SUFFERING AND EXILE
POD0000000504_S0000103 AND JACOB SAYS SOMETHING VERY PROFOUND TO THE ANGEL
POD0000000504_S0000109 WHEN MY LATE FATHER DIED NOW I'M IN MOURNING FOR MY LATE MOTHER
POD0000000504_S0000114 HOW EASILY YOU CAN LOSE THOSE YOU LOVE
POD0000000504_S0000127 THERE'S THIS ONGOING TENSION BETWEEN SEEING HAPPINESS AS
POD0000000504_S0000134 BUT IT CONTAINS BLESSING WITHIN IT
POD0000000504_S0000143 SHOW US THE WAY THROUGH THIS
POD0000000504_S0000149 I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO SAY A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE LINK YOU UNDERSTAND BETWEEN BEAUTY AND VIRTUE AND HAPPINESS
POD0000000504_S0000164 BUT BEAUTY IN A SENSE IS MORE INTERIORIZING
POD0000000504_S0000174 TAKE US HUMAN BEINGS OUT AND LOOK AT NATURE
POD0000000504_S0000180 TO BE VIRTUOUS IS TO BE BEAUTIFUL
POD0000000504_S0000190 WE'RE DRAWN TO BEAUTY AND OUR SOUL IS DRAWN TO BEAUTY
POD0000000504_S0000201 I WONDER HOW YOU REACT TO HAPPINESS BEING DEFINED AS A RIGHT
POD0000000504_S0000218 THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT PROVIDE HAPPINESS
POD0000000504_S0000233 AND HE WONDERS WHY THEY'RE ALL RUNNING SO FRENETICALLY
POD0000000504_S0000239 NOW WHICH BITS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURE DO WE STOP
POD0000000504_S0000247 AND SHE ASKED ONE FIVE-YEAR-OLD BOY
POD0000000504_S0000253 WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT THE SABBATH
POD0000000504_S0000269 ALL THE STREETS ARE EMPTY EVERYTHING SLOWS DOWN
POD0000000504_S0000286 YOU LEARN BY THIS
POD0000000504_S0000294 THEN WE EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST LINE OF ALL IN THE LIFE OF FAITH FROM PSALM TWENTY THREE
POD0000000504_S0000301 SOMETIMES PRAY WITHOUT IMAGES A KIND OF EMPTYING PRAYER
POD0000000504_S0000307 RUNNERS BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE BLESSING THAT COMES WITH PUTTING YOUR BODY TO WORK AND EMPTYING THE MIND
POD0000000504_S0000324 WE EXPLORE THEIR SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT TAKES ON WHERE THE BODY COMES INTO SPIRITUAL LIFE I'M KRISTA TIPPETT ON BEING CONTINUES IN A MOMENT
POD0000000504_S0000330 IT UNFOLDED BEFORE AN AUDIENCE OF FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE IN AN ATHLETIC COMPLEX THAT WAS TRANSFORMED BY LIGHT AND BY FLOWERS IN THE MAROONS AND GOLDS OF THE DALAI LAMA'S ROBES
POD0000000504_S0000340 IS ABOUT BODILY NEEDS SATISFIED
POD0000000504_S0000348 WELL
POD0000000504_S0000356 THAT GOD IS TO BE FOUND DOWN HERE IN THIS WORLD THAT GOD CREATED AND SEVEN TIMES PRONOUNCED GOOD
POD0000000504_S0000367 AND I MUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE BEST KIND OF INTERFAITH GATHERANCE I MEAN THEOLOGY IS EXTREMELY WONDERFUL
POD0000000504_S0000376 YOU KNOW
POD0000000504_S0000395 THERE'S SOMETHING INWARD THAT HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED
POD0000000504_S0000411 YET THEY HAVE NO SUCH WONDERFUL SORT OF
POD0000000504_S0000433 ONE SATISFACTION
POD0000000504_S0000448 OR SATISFACTION RELATED WITH SENSORY TYPES OF BODY
POD0000000504_S0000460 THAT HARDSHIP
POD0000000504_S0000470 YOUR HOLINESS
POD0000000504_S0000481 SUBVERTING THE VIOLENCE
POD0000000504_S0000497 AND FORCEFULLY STOP THEIR WRONG DOING
POD0000000504_S0000504 SO SUDDENLY THE DYNAMIC HAS CHANGED
POD0000000504_S0000513 AND EVENTUALLY THE ISRAELITES LEAVE THEY GO THROUGH THE DESERT
POD0000000504_S0000518 YOU'RE A STRANGER IN HIS LAND SOUNDS AS IF THE EGYPTIANS GAVE THEM HOSPITALITY AS IF THEY PUT UP THE ISRAELITES IN THE CAIRO HILTON
POD0000000504_S0000524 BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT LET GO OF HATE
POD0000000504_S0000530 YOU HAVE TO LET GO OF HATE IF YOU WANT TO BE FREE
POD0000000504_S0000537 REAL MEANING IS
POD0000000504_S0000559 THERE YOU'LL ALSO FIND OUR BLOG
POD0000000512_S0000021 DID YOU HAVE AN EXPERIENCE OF LOVE AND KINDNESS IN EDUCATION
POD0000000512_S0000054 ENABLE AWAKENING
POD0000000512_S0000062 AS WE ARE HARDWIRED TO LEARN LANGUAGE
POD0000000512_S0000078 WHEN TEACHERS INTERACT WITH STUDENTS
POD0000000512_S0000093 IS ONE OF THE FRUITS OF DISCOVERIES IN HIS BRAIN IMAGING LABORATORY AND HIS CENTER FOR HEALTHY MINDS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON
POD0000000512_S0000107 CULTURALLY
POD0000000512_S0000120 THAT IS REALLY POWERFUL
POD0000000512_S0000136 AN EXERCISE WHERE WE RING THE BELL AND WE ASK THE KIDS TO PAY VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SOUND
POD0000000512_S0000154 AND
POD0000000512_S0000163 AND YET
POD0000000512_S0000179 TODAY WITH NEUROSCIENTIST RICHARD DAVIDSON
POD0000000512_S0000190 WE OURSELVES HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON KIDS WHO WERE RAISED IN EASTERN EUROPEAN ORPHANAGES AND WHO WERE THEN ADOPTED INTO MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES
POD0000000512_S0000196 WHAT DO YOU SEE IN TERMS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION PRIORITIES IN REFERENCE TO THIS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH
POD0000000512_S0000209 AND HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT AN EDUCATION WHICH WOULD IMPROVE THIS FACULTY WOULD BE THE EDUCATION PAR EXCELLENCE
POD0000000512_S0000219 WE ALL ARE SUFFERING FROM AN ATTENTIONAL DYSFUNCTION
POD0000000512_S0000236 OUR ATTENTION IS STIMULUS-DRIVEN IT'S PULLED IT'S GRABBED
POD0000000512_S0000256 BUT IT'S CIVILIZATIONAL WORK
POD0000000512_S0000268 THERE'S BIASED LOVE AND THERE'S UNBIASED LOVE
POD0000000512_S0000284 IF YOU ACTUALLY MEASURE THEIR BODY
POD0000000512_S0000298 AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN PUSHED ON BY THE DALAI LAMA A LOT
POD0000000512_S0000313 AND YET THEIR BODY DOESN'T SEEM TO DECOMPOSE
POD0000000512_S0000327 I SOMETIMES THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL LOOK BACK AT US PERHAPS NOT IN THE TOO-DISTANT FUTURE AND LOOK AT THE WAY WE USE THE LANGUAGE OF BODY MIND SPIRIT LIKE THESE ARE THREE SEPARATE THINGS
POD0000000512_S0000344 BUT IT ABSOLUTELY MAKES SENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT LOVE AND KINDNESS AND RAISING NEW HUMANS IN THE WORLD
POD0000000512_S0000358 HELPING TO BUILD THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION FOR A LOVING WORLD
POD0000000520_S0000021 THE QUESTION I THINK PARENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO ANSWER IS HOW DO WE NOT JUST TEACH OUR CHILDREN'S MINDS
POD0000000520_S0000032 AND OUR THEME MUSIC IS PROVIDED AND COMPOSED BY ZOE KEATING
POD0000000528_S0000008 JEAN BERKO GLEASON SEES THIS AS A FRONTIER EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT AND THRILLING AS EXPLORING OUTER SPACE OR THE DEEP SEA WE ARE INNATELY PREDISPOSED TO PAY ATTENTION TO LITTLE CHILDREN AND TO TALK TO THEM
POD0000000528_S0000016 WAS THE FIRST TO PROVE THAT YOUNG CHILDREN ANALYZE THE WORDS AROUND THEM WITH INNATE MENTAL STRUCTURES AND AS IF BY MAGIC
POD0000000528_S0000021 SHE WAS AN AVID AND GIFTED POLYGLOT FROM AN EARLY AGE
POD0000000528_S0000031 AND I WAS PROBABLY THE PERSON WHO REALLY UNDERSTOOD HIM BEST
POD0000000528_S0000043 AND THE COURSE BLEW ME AWAY BECAUSE IT REALLY TALKED ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WERE INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT HOW IT IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS STORE LANGUAGE IN THEIR HEADS
POD0000000528_S0000076 CHILDREN OF THREE ARE ABLE TO MAKE PLURALS OF WORDS THEY'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE
POD0000000528_S0000087 AND EVEN LITTLE BITTY KIDS SAY TWO WUGS
POD0000000528_S0000117 ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM
POD0000000528_S0000150 BABIES ARE LISTENING TO LANGUAGE BEFORE THEY ARE BORN
POD0000000528_S0000159 IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE THEN IS ACQUIRED AND BUILT
POD0000000528_S0000180 EXCEPT IT WAS ALL IRREGULARS
POD0000000528_S0000211 WITH NOT REALIZING THE SENTIENCE OF OTHER CREATURES
POD0000000528_S0000217 SHE OBSERVED THAT THEIR IMPROBABLE SURVIVAL AND COHESIVENESS AS A CULTURE HAD TO DO WITH UNUSUALLY STRONG LINGUISTIC SOCIALIZATION
POD0000000528_S0000225 I WAS THINKING WHEN I WAS GETTING READY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH MARTIN REES A FEW MONTHS AGO WHO WAS A
POD0000000528_S0000245 AND WE BEGAN TO LOOK AT JUST THE CATEGORY OF ANIMALS
POD0000000528_S0000256 TWELVE ARE ANIMALS
POD0000000528_S0000319 HE WROTE A BOOK CALLED AN INTRODUCTION TO DESCRIPTIVE LINGUISTICS IT IS THE BOOK THAT I READ AND USED AS A TEXTBOOK AS A STUDENT OF LINGUISTICS
POD0000000528_S0000326 GET IT WRITTEN DOWN GIVE THE PEOPLE A WRITING SYSTEM SO THAT THEY CAN GIVE THEM THE BIBLE
POD0000000528_S0000344 AND SOME OF THEM ARE OUR ATTENTION TO THE WORLD
POD0000000528_S0000361 THE MOST IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE I SEE IS SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS IS CONSCIOUSNESS OF OURSELVES THE ABILITY TO REFLECT ON OURSELVES AND TO COMMENT ON THAT
POD0000000528_S0000396 MARIAH HELGESON MAIA TARRELL ANNIE PARSONS
POD0000000536_S0000010 AND SHE EMBODIES THIS WRYNESS AND WILDNESS IN HER LESSER-KNOWN SPIRITUAL PRACTICE AS A DEVOUT CATHOLIC
POD0000000536_S0000024 A LOT OF TERROR
POD0000000536_S0000059 BUT LAST NIGHT YOU WERE WAGGING FIREARMS IN OUR KITCHEN MOM
POD0000000536_S0000076 AND IF IN THOSE MOMENTS OF TERROR OR JUDGMENT
POD0000000536_S0000101 YOU SPOKE IN A SIMILAR WAY IN THIS BOOK NOW GO OUT THERE
POD0000000536_S0000124 AND IF YOU CAN GET CURIOUS ABOUT IT
POD0000000536_S0000141 MAKE THIS STOP IF YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO OCCUPY IT
POD0000000536_S0000159 RIGHT
POD0000000536_S0000175 TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING SMALL AND SIMPLE AND AS TRUE AS POSSIBLE REALLY IN SOME WAYS
POD0000000536_S0000187 TAKING IN THE NATURAL PEACE AND EASE OF YOUR MIND
POD0000000536_S0000205 AFTER TALKING TO THIS MAN FOR A WHILE HE LEANED FORWARD AND HE SAID TO HIM
POD0000000536_S0000217 THE MORE THAT JUST KIND OF SETTLES TO THE BOTTOM
POD0000000536_S0000231 TODAY I'M WITH THE POET AND MEMOIRIST MARY KARR

POD0000000536_S0000319 AS HUMAN BEINGS BUT THIS GRISLY AWFUL MORBID THING
POD0000000536_S0000337 AND IN IGNATIAN SPIRITUALITY THERE'S A THING YOU DO WHERE YOU COMPOSE A SCENE WITH YOUR BODY WITH ALL THE SENSES
POD0000000536_S0000352 AND SOMEWHERE IN THERE
POD0000000536_S0000371 I'M HAVING A HARD-ENOUGH TIME JUST GETTING THROUGH THE DAY
POD0000000536_S0000387 UNLESS YOU HAVE EMPATHY FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR OWN SUFFERING AND YOUR OWN PECCADILLOES
POD0000000536_S0000397 YOU WRITE NONE OF US CAN EVER KNOW THE VALUE OF OUR LIVES OR HOW OUR SEPARATE AND SILENT SCRIBBLING MAY ADD TO THE AMENITY OF THE WORLD IF ONLY BY HOW RADICALLY IT CHANGES US ONE AND BY ONE

POD0000000544_S0000012 SOMETIMES WHEN I THINK OF ALL OF THIS ENERGY THAT'S GOING ON ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY OF NAMING AND SHARING THEIR BELIEF I THINK IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT GOD CALLS SOME PEOPLE TO UNBELIEF IN ORDER THAT FAITH CAN TAKE NEW FORMS I'M KRISTA TIPPETT AND THIS IS ON BEING
POD0000000544_S0000019 MINGLE WITH OBSERVATIONS LIKE THIS IT WAS NEARLY DUSK MY FAVORITE TIME IN WEST TEXAS
POD0000000544_S0000024 GROWING UP ABSOLUTELY IMMERSED IN THIS RELIGIOUS UNIVERSE

POD0000000544_S0000067 MY GRANDMOTHER HAD A KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT
POD0000000544_S0000078 IT SAYS SHE WHO IN HER LAST DAYS LOVED TOO WELL TO LOSE A SINGLE WEED TO NAMELESSNESS
POD0000000544_S0000083 AMID THE CATTAILS' BRITTLE WHISPER WHISPERS O LAW' HONEY
POD0000000544_S0000092 THIS REAL TIE TO REALITY WHICH ALSO GETS INTELLECTUALIZED THE NOTION OF REALITY
POD0000000544_S0000113 BUT THAT A MORE VISUAL MATHEMATICS MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONVEY
POD0000000544_S0000143 I ACTUALLY WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE WORDS FAITH AND BELIEF
POD0000000544_S0000155 IF THAT ENERGY IS NOT FOCUSED OUTWARD
POD0000000544_S0000163 WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE UNTIL JUST A DECADE OR TWO AGO
POD0000000544_S0000185 I FIND BONHOEFFER AN INCREDIBLE FIGURE BECAUSE
POD0000000544_S0000208 TODAY I'M WITH CHRISTIAN WIMAN A POET AND ESSAYIST AND THE FORMER EDITOR OF POETRY MAGAZINE
POD0000000544_S0000213 IN AN ESSAY ON THIS SUBJECT CALLED HIVE OF NERVES

POD0000000544_S0000312 AND IT WAS ALL AIMED AT ME
POD0000000544_S0000318 IT IS NOW
POD0000000544_S0000328 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT AND THIS IS ON BEING
POD0000000544_S0000346 AND I THINK IF A CHURCH COULD ALLOW THOSE EXPERIENCES TO HAPPEN WITHOUT NECESSARILY PUTTING THEM IN PLACE AND SAYING THEY HAVE TO BE
POD0000000544_S0000356 WOULD YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY THAT
POD0000000544_S0000366 MEANING SOMETHING I DID NOT COMPREHEND BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS OFFENDED ME
POD0000000544_S0000373 NOT OF THE SONG OR THE SINGING
POD0000000544_S0000379 SHE SAID RIGHTLY
POD0000000544_S0000392 GOD GOES
POD0000000544_S0000397 THINK OF THE MAN WHO SITS ALONE TRYING TO WILL HIMSELF INTO A STILLNESS WHERE GOD GOES BELONGING
POD0000000544_S0000402 APART FROM WHAT MAN KNOWS GOD GOES BELONGING TO EVERY RIVEN THING HE'S MADE

POD0000000552_S0000128 VIGEN GUROIAN'S BOOKS ON THEOLOGY AND ETHICS INCLUDE TWO VOLUMES OF SPIRITUAL REFLECTION BY WAY OF GARDENING THE FRAGRANCE OF GOD AND INHERITING PARADISE
POD0000000552_S0000136 ORTHODOX WORSHIP OPENS HIM TO OTHER POSSIBILITIES AS WELL
POD0000000552_S0000149 BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THE WRITING YOU'VE DONE ABOUT GARDENING
POD0000000552_S0000160 WE DISAPPEAR IN MY VIEW
POD0000000552_S0000170 AND THEY LOOKED UP AT THE SKY AND THEY LIVE IN BALTIMORE RIGHT INSIDE OF BALTIMORE CITY

POD0000000552_S0000216 SO THAT BEAUTY FILLS OUR LIVES
POD0000000552_S0000228 IS THE MOST MYSTICAL SENSE
POD0000000552_S0000241 MY GUEST VIGEN GUROIAN IS DESCRIBING HIS EXPERIENCE OF EASTER AS A THEOLOGIAN AND A GARDENER
POD0000000552_S0000251 SEEING IS SO EASY
POD0000000552_S0000263 OVERNIGHT SOMETHING HAS BLOOMED
POD0000000552_S0000270 FOR MANY OF US THAT'S AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT OF EXPERIENCING GOD IN PRAYER
POD0000000552_S0000279 YES WELL
POD0000000552_S0000290 WHAT A WONDERFUL FLOWER
POD0000000552_S0000302 GOD COMMANDED HIS ANGELS TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE GARDEN AND TO GUARD THE PATHS TO IT WITH A FIERY SWORD
POD0000000552_S0000308 HE SENT AN ANGEL WHO REMOVED THEM FROM THE DARK PLACE AND LED THEM INTO THIS BRIGHT WORLD
POD0000000552_S0000315 THAT KIND OF STORY REMINDS ME AND IS COMFORTING OF THE FACT THAT I FEEL THE SAME WAY IN THE GARDEN
POD0000000552_S0000328 RESTORING THE SENSES GARDENING AND AN ORTHODOX EASTER
POD0000000552_S0000338 I DO HEAR THIS THEME COMING THROUGH
POD0000000552_S0000346 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON INSIDE OF ME
POD0000000552_S0000365 OR THE SONG OF SOLOMON YOU KNOW
POD0000000552_S0000381 I MEAN THAT'S
POD0000000552_S0000387 I DON'T THINK SO ULTIMATELY
POD0000000552_S0000402 THAT CAN BE BLESSED THAT CURSE CAN TURN TO A BLESSING
POD0000000552_S0000413 AROUND THE TIME OF LENT AND EASTER
POD0000000552_S0000430 WE FORGET GOD
POD0000000552_S0000440 SEVERAL SUMMERS AGO MY CHILDREN FOUND TWO TURTLES AND PUT THEM IN THE VEGETABLE GARDEN

POD0000000552_S0000459 HE SAYS HE IS THRILLED TO BE GROWING GRAPES AGAIN AFTER MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS THIS HOLDS RICH REMINDERS OF HIS CHILDHOOD
POD0000000552_S0000464 NORMAN ALLEN A WASHINGTON D C BASED PLAYWRIGHT
POD0000000560_S0000008 AND THE GREAT HERON FEEDS
POD0000000560_S0000016 I FIRST MET HER IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETY S
POD0000000560_S0000025 AS AN OFFERING TO OUR WORLD IN CRISIS
POD0000000560_S0000036 CONSCIOUSLY
POD0000000560_S0000049 LOOKED CALM TO ME THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ISN'T IT FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT
POD0000000560_S0000061 I REALIZED IT WAS CHANGING IN WAYS THAT WERE PROBABLY NOT HEALTHY
POD0000000560_S0000076 AND I THINK AT THE END OF THE FIRST SEMESTER ONE OF MY DOCTORAL STUDENT TEACHING ASSISTANTS SAID WHEN WE WERE MAKING UP THE FINAL EXAM
POD0000000560_S0000082 ITS HEALTH ITS LACK OF HEALTH
POD0000000560_S0000090 IN RESPECT TO OUR USE OF LAND
POD0000000560_S0000100 THINGS POP OUT AT ME THAT I HAD SIMPLY OVERLOOKED BEFORE
POD0000000560_S0000109 SEEDING PLANTS SUN AND STARS FISH AND FOWL
POD0000000560_S0000120 THE FIRST THING THAT STANDS OUT IS THAT THE RHYTHM OF THE PASSAGE CHANGES WHEN WE GET TO THE CREATION OF THE DRY LAND ON THE FIFTH DAY
POD0000000560_S0000125 WHEN THE DRY LAND BEGINS TO BE FURNISHED FOR HABITATION
POD0000000560_S0000138 IT CANNOT UNDO THAT PRIOR BLESSING
POD0000000560_S0000146 SYSTEM OF FERTILITY OF FRUITFULNESS TO PROVIDE FOR ALL
POD0000000560_S0000154 I MEAN YOU EVEN WRITE ABOUT EATING AS PRACTICAL THEOLOGY
POD0000000560_S0000169 WE ENTER DEEPLY INTO THE MYSTERY OF CREATION
POD0000000560_S0000178 I THINK WE ARE LETTING GO OF THAT DELUSION NOW
POD0000000560_S0000184 AND IT'S STRIKING THAT IN GENESIS ONE
POD0000000560_S0000193 THAT AS YOU SAID GENESIS ONE IS A LITURGICAL POEM
POD0000000560_S0000201 THE HEART
POD0000000560_S0000209 INTO WHICH WE ARE BORN AS A SPECIES
POD0000000560_S0000217 WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU USE THOSE PHRASES
POD0000000560_S0000223 THAT WE THINK OF CREATURES AS ANYONE WHO'S NOT HUMAN
POD0000000560_S0000233 POETRY SLOWS YOU DOWN
POD0000000560_S0000247 TODAY FOR THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF EARTH DAY I'M SPEAKING WITH THE THEOLOGIAN ELLEN DAVIS
POD0000000560_S0000252 HERE HE IS WITH HIS POEM THE MAN BORN TO FARMING
POD0000000560_S0000261 STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING THAT OBSCURES THE PLACE IT IS IN
POD0000000560_S0000269 AND THAT'S WHAT THE TEMPLE STANDS FOR THAT'S WHAT THE GARDEN OF EDEN STANDS FOR IN THE BIBLE IT'S THE PLACE WHERE HUMANS LIVED IN THE IMMEDIATE PRESENCE OF GOD
POD0000000560_S0000281 HOW WE EAT AND DRINK
POD0000000560_S0000288 BUT IT'S THE QUESTION OF POSSESSION CAN NEVER BE SEPARATED FROM THE QUESTION OF CARE
POD0000000560_S0000301 THAT
POD0000000560_S0000306 AND THAT I THINK IS THE PROPHETIC DIMENSION OF SCRIPTURE ITSELF
POD0000000560_S0000315 BECAUSE FAILURE AND WEARINESS ARE SURE IN ALL THAT MORTAL WISHING HAS INSPIRED
POD0000000560_S0000322 UPROAR OF WHEEL AND FIRE THAT HAS CONTAINED US LIKE A CELL OPENS AND LETS US HEAR A STILLNESS LONGER THAN ALL TIME WHERE LEAF AND SONG FULFILL THE PASSING LIGHT
POD0000000560_S0000335 ALL OF THOSE BOOKS BRING US TO DESPAIR IF WE TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY IF WE APPLY THEM TO OUR LIVES THEY IN A SENSE BRING US TO OUR KNEES
POD0000000560_S0000343 BUT THEN THERE BEGINS TO BE A SORT OF BRIGHTENING ON THE PATH YOU MIGHT SAY
POD0000000560_S0000352 AND IN ORDER TO HAVE HOPE
POD0000000560_S0000360 IF YOU DON'T SHED SOME TEARS WHILE YOU'RE HERE YOU WILL HAVE MISSED THE POINT
POD0000000560_S0000367 PRAY FOR THE WORLD'S LIGHT THUS BORNE AWAY PRAY FOR THE LITTLE SONGS THAT WAKE AND MOVE
POD0000000560_S0000373 AFTER ALL THE YEARS
POD0000000560_S0000379 WENDELL BERRY ALSO CONTRIBUTED THE FOREWORD TO ELLEN DAVIS'S BOOK SCRIPTURE CULTURE AND AGRICULTURE AN AGRARIAN READING OF THE BIBLE
POD0000000560_S0000387 HELPING TO BUILD THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION FOR A LOVING WORLD
POD0000000568_S0000009 BUT IT DOES HAVE GUIDING FIGURES IN EVERY GENERATION
POD0000000568_S0000017 IT WAS ONLY IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY THAT BIBLICALLY CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS WHO BECAME KNOWN AS EVANGELICALS
POD0000000568_S0000023 REACTED AGAINST WHAT SEEMED A REPUBLICAN APPROPRIATION OF FAITH AND A DEMOCRATIC NEGLECT OF IT
POD0000000568_S0000035 MODERATELY CONSERVATIVE ON ISSUES OF PERSONAL MORALITY
POD0000000568_S0000045 AND IT WAS THAT LEVEL OF COMMITMENT AND PASSION
POD0000000568_S0000062 AND LIFE IS SO DIFFERENT IN BLACK DETROIT JUST A FEW MILES OR BLOCKS AWAY
POD0000000568_S0000079 YOU KNOW OUR FAVORITE VERSE IN THOSE DAYS WAS FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD JOHN THREE SIXTEEN
POD0000000568_S0000095 AND I BEGAN TO READ IN THE BOOK OF MATTHEW
POD0000000568_S0000105 AND JESUS SAYS OF COURSE FAMOUSLY I WAS HUNGRY I WAS THIRSTY I WAS NAKED I WAS SICK
POD0000000568_S0000121 VERY RADICAL IDEA AND THE FIRST COVER KRISTA YOU SHOULD SEE IT
POD0000000568_S0000154 EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANITY WAS A POLITICAL FORCE IN THE WAY IT IS NOW
POD0000000568_S0000163 POVERTY WAS NOT ONE OF THE WATCHWORDS WELL
POD0000000568_S0000176 THEY REALLY DO
POD0000000568_S0000197 THE REPUBLICAN SIDE THERE ISN'T A CANDIDATE WHO EXEMPLIFIES A SORT OF
POD0000000568_S0000208 THIRTY THOUSAND KIDS DYING TODAY
POD0000000568_S0000222 THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE SEGREGATION OF MORAL VALUES FROM PUBLIC LIFE
POD0000000568_S0000228 OVER TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS TURNED OUT TO HEAR WALLIS AT THE PRESTIGIOUS EVANGELICAL WHEATON COLLEGE IN ILLINOIS
POD0000000568_S0000235 BECAUSE HE HAS ANOINTED ME TO PREACH GOOD NEWS TO THE POOR
POD0000000568_S0000244 WHO IS PRO-RICH
POD0000000568_S0000253 FROM THEIR PASSION FOR ECONOMIC JUSTICE I MEET THEM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
POD0000000568_S0000270 SPEAKING OF FAITH COMES TO YOU FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA
POD0000000568_S0000277 TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE KAY
POD0000000568_S0000282 ARE IN COLLABORATION ACROSS THE PARTISAN AND CULTURAL DIVIDES OF RECENT YEARS JIM WALLIS IS BEST KNOWN AS THE FOUNDER AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF SOJOURNERS
POD0000000568_S0000289 AND HE TOO HAS POSITIONED HIMSELF AS A PASTOR AND SPIRITUAL ADVISOR TO POWERFUL PEOPLE
POD0000000568_S0000299 I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME OPEN DOORS IN SOME OF THE KEY CAPITALS OF THE WORLD AND WHEN YOU SAY OPEN DOORS OPEN TO WHAT
POD0000000568_S0000309 THOSE WHO GENERALLY HAD SPIRITUAL FOUNDATIONS
POD0000000568_S0000322 TWO IS WE HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT STRATEGY
POD0000000568_S0000331 HOW CAN ANYONE SAY THAT NOT AFFORDING HEALTH CARE AND HAVING NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO AND HAVING EDUCATION THAT DOESN'T EDUCATE AREN'T CAUSES OF POVERTY
POD0000000568_S0000342 WE FOUND EVERY PASSAGE IN THE BIBLE ABOUT POOR PEOPLE
POD0000000568_S0000349 I'D TAKE IT OUT TO PREACH I'D SAY BROTHERS AND SISTERS THIS IS THE AMERICAN BIBLE
POD0000000568_S0000358 EVANGELICAL SOCIAL ACTIVIST JIM WALLIS
POD0000000568_S0000368 AND SO
POD0000000568_S0000382 AND THEN THEY LICK THEIR FINGER AND THEY PUT IT BACK UP AND THEY SEE WHICH WAY THE WIND IS BLOWING YOU CAN'T CHANGE A NATION BY REPLACING ONE WET-FINGERED POLITICIAN WITH ANOTHER
POD0000000568_S0000392 WELL
POD0000000568_S0000404 I ALWAYS HEAR BACK TWO WORDS WE'RE LOOKING FOR MEANING AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR CONNECTION
POD0000000568_S0000421 THEY'RE CREATING I THINK
POD0000000568_S0000430 INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES OF FAITH COULD HELP SUPPLY THE ETHICS FOR GLOBALIZATION THE RULES OF A GLOBAL NEIGHBORHOOD THAT COME FROM THE PROPHETIC TRADITION THAT'S EMBEDDED IN ALL OF OUR GREAT RELIGIOUS FAITH COMMUNITIES
POD0000000568_S0000438 AND I THINK THAT CHOICE FOR HOPE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION THE FAITH COMMUNITY HAS TO MAKE TO THE WORLD
POD0000000568_S0000455 LET US KNOW IF YOU USE SPEAKING OF FAITH IN YOUR COURSES
POD0000000576_S0000004 HAS HELPED CREATE A NATIONAL MOVEMENT FOR OPENING UP ABOUT GRIEF AND LOSS IN THE LIVES OF YOUNG PEOPLE OVER SHARED MEALS
POD0000000576_S0000017 THEN WE HAVE TO BE TEACHABLE
POD0000000576_S0000024 JEN I'D LOVE TO START WITH YOU ABOUT HEARING HOW YOU WOULD BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THE SPIRITUAL OR RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND OF YOUR CHILDHOOD
POD0000000576_S0000041 WAS SACRED SPACE
POD0000000576_S0000062 IN CIVIC AND CIVILIZATIONAL TERMS
POD0000000576_S0000071 WHICH WAS AMAZING
POD0000000576_S0000079 I DON'T FEEL SAFE
POD0000000576_S0000096 THAT SAFETY IS AN ILLUSION THAT'S ONLY AFFORDED TO A FEW PEOPLE
POD0000000576_S0000102 I REMEMBERED STORIES
POD0000000576_S0000108 AND AS I REFLECT ON THIS MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY
POD0000000576_S0000117 AND WE ARE AT A REALLY DEEP AND IMPORTANT MOMENT OF UNCOVERING THAT IS UGLY
POD0000000576_S0000131 WHOEVER THEY VOTED FOR
POD0000000576_S0000142 WHAT I REMEMBERED
POD0000000576_S0000150 AND I HEARD A KNOCK ON THE DOOR
POD0000000576_S0000156 AND FOR ME
POD0000000576_S0000162 OF ACCUSATION
POD0000000576_S0000172 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
POD0000000576_S0000186 WHAT A RELIEF
POD0000000576_S0000197 THERE YOU'LL ALSO FIND THIS AND OTHER CONVERSATIONS TOGETHER WITH ON BEING'S BETTER CONVERSATIONS STARTER GUIDE AND GROUNDING VIRTUES
POD0000000576_S0000226 AND FOR ME WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE CHANT STUFF LIKE BLOOD AND SOIL AND JEWS WILL NOT REPLACE US I THINK ABOUT MY FUTURE CHILDREN AS SOMEONE WHO IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN LIVING IN THE SOUTH MARRIED TO A PRACTICING JEW OUR FUTURE KIDS ARE THE EMBODIMENT OF EVERYTHING THESE PEOPLE PROFESS TO HATE
POD0000000576_S0000235 WHETHER YOU VOTED THE SAME WAY OR NOT
POD0000000576_S0000248 AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN REALLY INTENTIONAL ABOUT IN THE METHODOLOGY OF THE PEOPLE'S SUPPER IN PARTICULAR IS THAT WE DON'T LEAD WITH QUESTIONS AROUND YOUR POLITICAL IDENTITY OR WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT
POD0000000576_S0000271 IT WILL REQUIRE THE COURAGE OF EVERYDAY HEROES TO DIG DEEP AND FIND WITHIN THEMSELVES THE WHEREWITHAL TO LEAN INTO ONE ANOTHER AND REPAIR THE BREACH OF RELATIONSHIPS THIS ELECTION HAS EXPOSED
POD0000000576_S0000279 AND I KNOW THAT THE ONLY WAY
POD0000000576_S0000290 BECAUSE IT'S WHEN WE START TO CAST EACH OTHER ASIDE
POD0000000576_S0000298 AND I'M HAPPY MY HEART IS BROKEN BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID THAT I'D BECOME TOO COMPLACENT
POD0000000576_S0000320 AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO TRUE ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN UP TO
POD0000000576_S0000326 WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO ENGAGE ONE ANOTHER AND BE WRONG SOMETIMES AND THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A CULTURE
POD0000000576_S0000339 I DO WANT TO THROW IN HERE THAT PART OF ACCOMPANIMENT IS INSISTING ON JOY AND REFRESHMENT AND RESILIENCE
POD0000000576_S0000358 HE WAS DRINKING TOO AND SHARING TABLES ALL THE TIME
POD0000000576_S0000368 BY MICKY SCOTTBEY JONES
POD0000000576_S0000378 THERE YOU CAN ALSO LISTEN TO THIS AGAIN AND FIND ON BEING'S BETTER CONVERSATIONS STARTER GUIDE AND GROUNDING VIRTUES
POD0000000584_S0000004 SHE IS A CONTRIBUTING EDITOR TO HARPER'S MAGAZINE AND THE AUTHOR OF PROFOUND BOOKS THAT DEFY CATEGORY
POD0000000584_S0000009 AND THAT PURPOSEFULNESS AND CONNECTEDNESS BRING JOY EVEN AMIDST DEATH CHAOS FEAR AND LOSS
POD0000000584_S0000016 THE MOTHER OF ALL QUESTIONS
POD0000000584_S0000026 I WROTE SOMEWHERE THAT I HAD AN INSIDE-OUT CHILDHOOD BECAUSE EVERY PLACE WAS SAFE BUT HOME
POD0000000584_S0000036 THAT'S LOVELY
POD0000000584_S0000054 AND THAT THIS WILL GIVE THEM THIS BIGGER SENSE OF SELF YEAH
POD0000000584_S0000068 BECAUSE WE'RE FRAGILE OR OUR MORALITY IS ALSO FRAGILE AND WE REVERT TO OUR BEST-DEAL SAVAGE SOCIAL DARWINIST HOBBESIAN NATURE AND GO OUT RAPING AND LOOTING THOSE MYTHS BECAME A SECONDARY DISASTER WORSE THAN THE HURRICANE THAT HIT
POD0000000584_S0000075 HOPE FOR ME JUST MEANS A BUDDHIST SENSE OF UNCERTAINTY OF COMING TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND THAT THERE'S MAYBE ROOM FOR US TO INTERVENE
POD0000000584_S0000091 AND COMPASSION AND ENGAGEMENT
POD0000000584_S0000109 HIGHER MORE SPIRITUAL SENSE OF COMMUNITY THAN PRIVATE LIFE HAD OFFERED HER
POD0000000584_S0000117 AND THAT IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A STEADY STATE AND THAT'S OK
POD0000000584_S0000130 YEAH AND I LISTENED TO HIS INTERVIEW AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH HOPE IS GROUNDED IN MEMORY
POD0000000584_S0000147 YOU CAN ALWAYS LISTEN AGAIN AND HEAR THE UNEDITED VERSION OF EVERY SHOW WE DO ON THE ON BEING PODCAST FEED WHEREVER PODCASTS ARE FOUND
POD0000000584_S0000161 AND FOR EXAMPLE OCCUPY WALL STREET WAS PRONOUNCED A FAILURE BEFORE IT HAD REALLY GOTTEN GOING
POD0000000584_S0000170 RIGHT IN THAT MOMENT
POD0000000584_S0000186 BUT PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO EVACUATE WERE LEFT BEHIND TO FACE WHAT HAPPENED
POD0000000584_S0000214 AND THAT SPLIT OFF INTO COMMON GROUND CLINIC WHICH IS STILL GOING STRONG MORE THAN TEN YEARS LATER
POD0000000584_S0000223 AND THEY ENGAGE IN PUBLIC CELEBRATION THEY TALK TO STRANGERS
POD0000000584_S0000232 OK HERE WE ARE ON THE FASTEST ERODING COASTLINE IN THE WORLD
POD0000000584_S0000246 TODAY WITH WRITER HISTORIAN AND ACTIVIST REBECCA SOLNIT
POD0000000584_S0000263 BUT THEY MATTER
POD0000000584_S0000276 AND MOST OF IT DOESN'T LOOK THAT GOOD BUT THEY DID OVERTHROW A BUNCH OF REGIMES

POD0000000592_S0000101 THE PROCESS IS NEVER IT'S ALWAYS WRONG
POD0000000592_S0000122 EVEN IN THE YEARS OF

POD0000000600_S0000274 WHEN IN A SETTING LIKE THAT WHERE THE STORIES WERE HELD THE PEOPLE WERE HELD
POD0000000600_S0000300 I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT
POD0000000600_S0000320 AND THERE'S A REAL HELPLESSNESS THAT THEY FEEL IN HEARING THIS WITHOUT HAVING TO DO ANYTHING ELSE

POD0000000608_S0000015 RICHARD MOUW
POD0000000608_S0000026 TODAY ON BEING RESTORING POLITICAL CIVILITY AN EVANGELICAL VIEW
POD0000000608_S0000032 MOUW HIMSELF BECAME ESTRANGED FROM THE CHURCH FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN HIS EARLY ADULTHOOD IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY S
POD0000000608_S0000046 PEOPLE HAD THIS WILD STUFF
POD0000000608_S0000069 AND WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS CONVICTED CIVILITY
POD0000000608_S0000095 SENSE OF KINSHIP
POD0000000608_S0000109 SO PARTLY WHAT I WANT TO DO IS
POD0000000608_S0000142 AND THEN OVER ACROSS THE TRACKS
POD0000000608_S0000157 I'M SPEAKING WITH RICHARD MOUW
POD0000000608_S0000167 I THINK ONE ELEMENT HERE THAT FEELS VERY DRAMATIC AND TROUBLING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING THIS IS
POD0000000608_S0000173 BUT THE TRUTH ELEMENT OF CIVILITY IS ITSELF ONE OF THE CONVICTIONS
POD0000000608_S0000187 WELL I MEAN I THINK THAT
POD0000000608_S0000209 WE HAVE A CULTURE OF FEAR RIGHT
POD0000000608_S0000234 A MORE TRUTHFUL ASSESSMENT
POD0000000608_S0000242 AT THAT TIME HE WAS THE LATEST IN A STRING OF SUICIDES BY GAY YOUTH
POD0000000608_S0000247 HE DECLARED
POD0000000608_S0000252 SARCASTIC JABS
POD0000000608_S0000262 BELIEVES THAT THE MEASURE OF CHRISTIAN INTEGRITY IS AS MUCH ABOUT HOW ONE TREATS OTHERS AS ABOUT THE POSITIONS ONE TAKES
POD0000000608_S0000267 RICHARD MOUW IS PRESIDENT OF FULLER THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY THAT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST CENTERS OF EVANGELICAL HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE WORLD
POD0000000608_S0000274 IS EMBARRASSED BY THE IMAGE OF EVANGELICALISM AS
POD0000000608_S0000297 GOD HAS A GENTLE AND REVERENT CONCERN FOR PUBLIC RIGHTEOUSNESS
POD0000000608_S0000322 AND SHE JUST STORMED AWAY
POD0000000608_S0000339 RICHARD MOUW
POD0000000608_S0000365 WHERE I WOULD ASK MY GAY AND LESBIAN ACTIVIST FRIENDS
POD0000000608_S0000373 ONE REMARK THAT HIT ESPECIALLY CLOSE TO HOME WAS MADE BY THE EDITOR OF THIS MAGAZINE NEWSWEEK
POD0000000608_S0000383 BUT I GOT SOME WONDERFULLY
POD0000000608_S0000408 NOR IS IT VERY HELPFUL WHEN PEOPLE
POD0000000608_S0000420 THAT THE FACT THAT OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO SCHOOL TOGETHER THAT
POD0000000608_S0000432 THEY INCLUDE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ELDER VINCENT HARDING
POD0000000616_S0000018 THAT'S IN THIS STORY HE TELLS FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT GIVING A BLESSING TO A KID NAMED LOUIE
POD0000000616_S0000048 WHY DID YOU STAY
POD0000000616_S0000059 WHICH AT THAT TIME I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS STILL TRUE WAS THE POOREST PARISH IN THE CITY AND HAD THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF GANG ACTIVITY IN THE WORLD AT THAT TIME
POD0000000616_S0000074 AND THAT AS MUCH AS WE ARE CALLED TO BRIDGE THE DISTANCE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN US
POD0000000616_S0000094 WRONG AGAIN
POD0000000616_S0000111 AND HE NOW WORKS IN A SUBSTANCE ABUSE PART OF OUR TEAM
POD0000000616_S0000123 I FOUND THIS KID
POD0000000616_S0000129 BECAUSE I WAS ASHAMED OF MY WOUNDS
POD0000000616_S0000135 AND AWE CAME UPON EVERYONE
POD0000000616_S0000145 WE'VE OVERUSED AND WATERED DOWN SOME OF THE WORDS WE NEED THE MOST THAT ACTUALLY MEAN THE MOST
POD0000000616_S0000157 THROUGH YOUR KINDNESS AND TENDERNESS AND FOCUSED ATTENT OF LOVE
POD0000000616_S0000173 BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HE'S RETURNED ME TO MYSELF
POD0000000616_S0000185 WELL
POD0000000616_S0000190 AND THEN YOU SHOWED UP
POD0000000616_S0000201 AND SO WE'VE WRESTLED THE CUP OUT OF JESUS'S HAND
POD0000000616_S0000209 I INVITED SIX OTHER GUYS FROM THE GRAFFITI CREW WHO DIDN'T HAD NO PLACE TO GO HE SAID
POD0000000616_S0000221 SO WHAT COULD BE MORE SACRED THAN SEVEN ORPHANS
POD0000000616_S0000227 THAT WE MIGHT FORGET THAT IT'S ORDINARY THAT IT'S A MEAL SHARED AMONG FRIENDS
POD0000000616_S0000247 BECAUSE GANG MEMBERS COME TO US WITH THIS DISORGANIZED ATTACHMENT
POD0000000616_S0000255 BUT IT WON'T TOPPLE THEM
POD0000000616_S0000272 WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HIS UNDERSTANDINGS OF LIFE OF SERVICE AND OF GOD
POD0000000616_S0000281 HAVE FACED MORTALITY
POD0000000616_S0000292 AND THE TRICK IS NOT TO BE TOPPLED
POD0000000616_S0000304 NOW HERE THIS SO THAT I'LL BE PRESENT
POD0000000616_S0000313 WHAT IS THERE TO BE DONE BESIDES SHRUGGING MY SHOULDERS AND WRITING A CHECK
POD0000000616_S0000322 IF YOU WILL AN OTHERNESS SO THAT WE WOULD
POD0000000616_S0000343 IT'S THE BEGINNING
POD0000000616_S0000349 MY GOD I'M GETTING MORE FROM THIS YOU KNOW EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS
POD0000000616_S0000359 THANKS
POD0000000616_S0000368 A DEFENDANT
POD0000000616_S0000373 WHY BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE FORCED TO IN THE FACE OF SOMEBODY WHO'S MENTALLY ILL
POD0000000616_S0000385 I INTERVIEWED HIM IN THE OUTDOOR HALL OF PHILOSOPHY AT THE CHAUTAUQUA INSTITUTION
POD0000000616_S0000396 AS YOU GIVE THESE TALKS AROUND THE COUNTRY
POD0000000616_S0000408 I SAID NO I DON'T
POD0000000616_S0000420 ARE SO INTENSE
POD0000000616_S0000436 THAT IN THE END IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING IT'S ABOUT KINSHIP IT'S ABOUT OSCAR-WINNING ACTRESS ATTITUDINAL WAITRESS
POD0000000616_S0000447 AND YOU PROBABLY ARE TOO HUMBLE TO WANT TO TAKE THAT IN
POD0000000616_S0000462 OTHERWISE SOMEONE WOULD CALL THE COPS
POD0000000616_S0000471 OUR LOVELY THEME MUSIC IS PROVIDED AND COMPOSED BY ZOE KEATING
POD0000000616_S0000481 FIND OUT MORE AT HUMANITYUNITED DOT ORG
POD0000000624_S0000021 WE STILL FOUND JOY IN LIFE WE STILL LOVED PEOPLE AND HAD RELATIONSHIPS AND BREAKUPS
POD0000000624_S0000037 AND
POD0000000624_S0000054 AND LISTENS CAREFULLY FOR THE DIVINE IN THE EVERYDAY
POD0000000624_S0000063 YOU'VE SPENT SO MUCH OF YOUR CAREER IN MANY COUNTRIES
POD0000000624_S0000072 AND I THINK IT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR US TO THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT MOMENT IN REFERENCE TO HOW SHE WOULD FRAME THE TWO HUNDRED YEAR PRESENT WE STUDENTS WOULD BE WALKED THROUGH THIS VERY SIMPLE EXERCISE YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT NOW IN THE NEXT TWO MINUTES SO HERE IT COMES IF YOU JUST CALCULATE FOR A MINUTE SO WHEN SHE SAID PRESENT SHE MEANT LIKE PAST PRESENT FUTURE
POD0000000624_S0000078 AND THEN YOU DO THE SECOND PART OF THE PROCESS WHICH IS
POD0000000624_S0000083 YOU WERE HELD AND TOUCHED
POD0000000624_S0000094 REALLY REALLY BIG PART OF MY JOURNEY
POD0000000624_S0000108 AND WHEN I GOT INTO COLLEGE
POD0000000624_S0000120 SHE SAID TO HIM
POD0000000624_S0000125 AND THE CHARACTER HAD A DREAM OF GOING TO COLLEGE AND HER PARENTS DID NOT SUPPORT THAT DREAM SHE HAD TO WORK IN THE FACTORY TO HELP HER PARENTS MAKE ENDS MEET
POD0000000624_S0000140 AND COMING BACK TO IT WHAT I DISCOVERED
POD0000000624_S0000150 YOU CAN'T JUST PULL OUT A TOOL
POD0000000624_S0000158 AND I'M THINKING
POD0000000624_S0000168 TO BE HUMAN IS TO STORY
POD0000000624_S0000178 WAS THE MANAGER TO A DEPARTMENT OF WOMEN WHO CLEANED HOTEL ROOMS
POD0000000624_S0000187 IN THIS COUNTRY
POD0000000624_S0000210 NOT THREATENED BY IT HOW TO BRING UP GREAT IDEAS THAT WE HELP THEM THINK ARE THEIRS
POD0000000624_S0000220 BECAUSE IF I ERR TOO FAR ON ONE SIDE
POD0000000624_S0000236 NECESSARILY
POD0000000624_S0000242 I AM DEEPLY CONVINCED THAT CHANGE MUST BE RELATIONSHIP-CENTERED
POD0000000624_S0000252 THAT WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO SPEAK TO THAT DEHUMANIZATION
POD0000000624_S0000261 PEACE AND JUSTICE HAVE KISSED IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE PEOPLE
POD0000000624_S0000270 WHAT ALIGNS US HAS NOT BEEN AS STRONG AS WHAT ALIGNS WHAT WON ON THAT DAY
POD0000000624_S0000279 WHO ARE RIGHTEOUSLY FULL OF RAGE
POD0000000624_S0000295 SEEING HOW RECKONING COMES TRANSFORMATION COMES
POD0000000624_S0000309 AND WHAT CONFLICT DESTROYS WHAT POLARIZATION SEPARATES
POD0000000624_S0000320 I GO AND SPEND TIME WHERE SHE'S FROM
POD0000000624_S0000331 YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE YEAST OUT OF THE JAR AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PREPARE IT
POD0000000624_S0000344 TODAY HOW CHANGE HAPPENS WITH JOHN PAUL LEDERACH
POD0000000624_S0000366 IN SO MANY WAYS
POD0000000624_S0000375 AND WHO'S TELLING THE STORY BETTER
POD0000000624_S0000391 AS AN AFRO-COLOMBIAN TO BECOMING A HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER
POD0000000624_S0000397 YOU CAN BE ANGRY
POD0000000624_S0000403 THERE WERE PERIODS WHERE TO BE HONEST MY ANGER WAS HEADED MORE FOR THE BITTER
POD0000000624_S0000410 AND I THINK THAT'S FOR ME WHAT SHIFTS IT IS THAT IT'S A QUALITY SO THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRYING TO CREATE A CONVERSATION FOR INSTRUMENTAL REASONS BECAUSE YOU HAVE A PURPOSE THAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET SOMEBODY TO DO SOMETHING AND COMMITTING YOURSELF TO FRIENDSHIP
POD0000000624_S0000425 HELPING TO BUILD THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION FOR A LOVING WORLD
POD0000000632_S0000009 IN A SHORT ENOUGH PERIOD OF TIME AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000000632_S0000024 BUT NO BELIEF
POD0000000632_S0000045 QUEERNESS GAVE ME THE LANGUAGE FOR EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT LIBERATION AND FREEDOM
POD0000000632_S0000066 AND SO CAPITALISM IN ITS CURRENT FORM COULDN'T SURVIVE PATRIARCHY COULDN'T SURVIVE WHITE SUPREMACY COULDN'T SURVIVE IF ENOUGH OF US
POD0000000632_S0000076 TO A FRIEND AS I WAS ON THE WAY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THAT
POD0000000632_S0000085 BUT FOR US TO TRANSFORM AS A SOCIETY WE HAVE TO ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE TRANSFORMED AS INDIVIDUALS AND FOR US TO BE TRANSFORMED AS INDIVIDUALS
POD0000000632_S0000093 THAT THEY MUST BE SUFFERING
POD0000000632_S0000106 A SPIRITUAL TRADITION
POD0000000632_S0000116 OUR OWN SENSE OF OUR EMOTIONS HOW WE INTERPRET ANY GIVEN FEELING
POD0000000632_S0000122 OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPACTING US OUTSIDE
POD0000000632_S0000127 AND FOR THE MOST PART WE ALMOST NEVER GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE THEM AND SORT THROUGH THEM KIND OF LIKE THAT DRAWER THAT COLLECTS EVERYTHING IN YOUR HOUSE I HAVE A FEW OF THOSE
POD0000000632_S0000133 THIS IS NOT MINE THAT'S THE INHERITANCE OF WHITE SUPREMACY
POD0000000632_S0000145 HOW DO I GET THEM TO STOP
POD0000000632_S0000162 YOU ARE A TEACHER YOU ARE STEEPED IN THIS TRADITION
POD0000000632_S0000177 HOW EXTRAORDINARY THAT BLACK PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR
POD0000000632_S0000188 STARING AT A GAGGLE OF WHITE PEOPLE'S FEET
POD0000000632_S0000206 THEY
POD0000000632_S0000227 WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE
POD0000000632_S0000253 IT IS DEVELOPING OUR OWN CAPACITY
POD0000000632_S0000258 IT'S
POD0000000632_S0000279 THAT I
POD0000000632_S0000286 DEFINED BY THE WORK THAT WE DO OR THE PLACE FROM WHICH WE COME
POD0000000632_S0000299 IN CONFRONTATION WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDERSTANDABLY
POD0000000632_S0000304 BECAUSE
POD0000000632_S0000315 OUR TEACHERS
POD0000000632_S0000320 MONTH TO MONTH
POD0000000632_S0000326 AND RATHER THAN SEEING THOSE MOMENTS AS THREATS TO WHO WE ARE
POD0000000632_S0000331 WHAT HAS THAT INSPIRED
POD0000000632_S0000339 DESIRE THAT WE HAVE FOR OUR OWN DEVELOPMENT IN LIFE
POD0000000632_S0000344 WE WILL BE A SOCIETY THAT ENHANCES THE LIVES OF ALL OUR SPECIES
POD0000000632_S0000351 I THINK WE HAVE
POD0000000632_S0000370 IN A SHORT ENOUGH PERIOD OF TIME AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000000632_S0000382 HELPING TO BUILD THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION FOR A LOVING WORLD
POD0000000640_S0000005 THIS HOUR ELIZABETH ALEXANDER SHARES HER SENSE OF WHAT POETRY WORKS IN US AND IN OUR CHILDREN AND WHY IT MAY BECOME MORE RELEVANT NOT LESS SO
POD0000000640_S0000016 HER FAMILY BACKGROUND THOUGH NOT LINKED TO POETRY
POD0000000640_S0000023 SO WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT YOUR CHILDHOOD NOW
POD0000000640_S0000038 DOING WELL IN SCHOOL THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO ARTICULATE IT
POD0000000640_S0000063 THE TRUTH OF A POEM IS ACTUALLY MUCH DEEPER THAN WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING REALLY HAPPENED
POD0000000640_S0000078 IT'S MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT
POD0000000640_S0000089 AND I THINK
POD0000000640_S0000107 LISTEN AND TAKE STOCK
POD0000000640_S0000116 SATISFYING A MAN
POD0000000640_S0000129 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT AND THIS IS ON BEING TODAY WITH POET ELIZABETH ALEXANDER
POD0000000640_S0000136 NATIONAL LOVE THAT CASTS A WIDENING POOL OF LIGHT
POD0000000640_S0000143 ON THE BRIM
POD0000000640_S0000162 AND I ASK THEM BECAUSE I THINK THAT POEMS ARE FANTASTIC SPACES WITH WHICH TO ARRIVE AT REAL CONUNDRUM-Y KINDS OF QUESTIONS TO GO AS FAR DOWN THE ROAD AS YOU CAN OF UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING AND THEN
POD0000000640_S0000186 SO SOMETHING THAT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN IS THIS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT IS UNIVERSAL AND WHAT IS PARTICULAR AND HOW WHAT IS PARTICULAR
POD0000000640_S0000201 MY POET SELF
POD0000000640_S0000212 READ THE TEXTS AND DOWNLOAD M P THREE S OF HER READING THEM FOR FREE
POD0000000640_S0000222 WE'RE DISCUSSING WHERE THE HUNGER FOR POETRY COMES FROM IN HUMAN LIFE
POD0000000640_S0000235 AND WOULD WE LET IT IN AND KEEP IT VERY CLEAN ANTICIPATE A MESSAGE LET IT BEGIN
POD0000000640_S0000248 AUDRE LORDE'S FAMOUS ESSAY POETRY IS NOT A LUXURY
POD0000000640_S0000269 I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT ACTUALLY
POD0000000640_S0000285 THEY ARE INCREDIBLY POWERFULLY MEDITATIVE
POD0000000640_S0000294 I THINK THEREFORE I AM
POD0000000640_S0000314 WOULD YOU READ THE POEM
POD0000000640_S0000323 NO LONGER A CELEBRITY
POD0000000640_S0000330 SILENCE THEN EVERYTHING JAZZ
POD0000000640_S0000336 ON THE BEAUTY OF HAIR ITSELF
POD0000000640_S0000342 AS IT SHRINKS AS IT TURNS TO SOMETHING ELSE
POD0000000640_S0000367 SO
POD0000000640_S0000379 HER BOOKS OF POETRY INCLUDE CRAVE RADIANCE
POD0000000640_S0000386 THEN INTO MORE TANGIBLE ACTION
POD0000000648_S0000016 TODAY SHE'S A PROFESSOR OF RELIGIOUS STUDIES AT FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY
POD0000000648_S0000030 IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER OK
POD0000000648_S0000048 BUT IT REALLY HURT US SO DEEPLY BECAUSE WE WERE BELIEVING THAT WE HAD DONE THE RIGHT THING
POD0000000648_S0000078 I WONDER HOW DID THE BLACK POWER MOVEMENT TAKE UP THAT IMAGE OR WRESTLE WITH IT OR WORK WITH IT YOU KNOW
POD0000000648_S0000084 AFTER HAVING BEEN ARRESTED
POD0000000648_S0000093 THIS IS ABOUT US SHARING POWER
POD0000000648_S0000116 A CULTURE THAT HAS DENIGRATED BLACK PEOPLE
POD0000000648_S0000123 AND I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS I AM TOTALLY MESMERIZED I'M SCARED TO EVEN LISTEN TO IT IT'S SO INCENDIARY YOU KNOW COMPARED TO ANYTHING ELSE I KNOW
POD0000000648_S0000131 THEY OFTEN DESCRIBE
POD0000000648_S0000156 YEAH THOSE TENSIONS INCLUDE A TENSION BETWEEN THE STRUGGLE FOR JUSTICE AND THE COMMITMENT TO LOVE
POD0000000648_S0000169 ON BEING CONTINUES IN A MOMENT
POD0000000648_S0000189 BUT THEN THERE WAS ALSO THAT PART OF MY LIFE WHERE I WAS LIVING IN SOUTHEAST GEORGIA AND YOU KNOW I REMEMBER BEING CONFRONTED EARLY ON BY THE N-WORD AND SO ON AND SO FORTH
POD0000000648_S0000209 YOU KNOW
POD0000000648_S0000225 AND INTERESTINGLY
POD0000000648_S0000238 AND WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS TEACHER I THOUGHT
POD0000000648_S0000244 DOES IT MEAN I HAVE TO GIVE UP THE OUTWARD STRUGGLE AND THAT WAS A BIG PROBLEM FOR ME
POD0000000648_S0000252 VIOLENCE IN VARIOUS WAYS
POD0000000648_S0000259 WHO FEELS DEEPLY
POD0000000648_S0000275 I AM AND YOU ARE IN THEIR CORNER

POD0000000648_S0000295 YOU DESCRIBED SEVERAL DIFFERENT
POD0000000648_S0000305 AND THIS FEELING OF NOT BEING QUALIFIED
POD0000000648_S0000316 AND FRUITVALE STATION
POD0000000648_S0000325 TAKE ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS
POD0000000648_S0000333 BUT FOR SOME REASON WE ARE FRAGMENTED
POD0000000648_S0000343 THAT THE NUANCE GETS LOST THE DIVERSITY GETS LOST BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS BLACK RIGHT
POD0000000648_S0000354 THAT
POD0000000648_S0000366 YOU KNOW HE TALKED ABOUT ON ONE HAND WE'RE CALLED TO BE THE GOOD SAMARITAN AND ON THE OTHER HAND WE'RE CALLED TO TRANSFORM THE JERICHO ROAD AND CHANGE THE EDIFICE THAT PRODUCES BEGGARS

POD0000000656_S0000041 WHY DO WE WASTE OUR TIME DOING THINGS WHICH IF WE ONLY STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT THEM
POD0000000656_S0000069 PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL SPIRITUAL
POD0000000656_S0000093 IN YOUR WORK
POD0000000656_S0000116 VISUAL CHRISTIAN FORM OF MIDRASH RIGHT
POD0000000656_S0000137 AND HE SAID WELL GOOD THEN YOU'LL BE WORKING IN A HOSPITAL
POD0000000656_S0000159 THAT'S VERY IGNATIAN
POD0000000656_S0000172 TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU TO HAVE A JESUIT NOW ON THE THRONE OF ST PETER
POD0000000656_S0000182 DO YOU THINK HE READ YOUR BOOK
POD0000000656_S0000214 THERE'S GOOD NEWS
POD0000000656_S0000246 TO FIND GOD IN ALL THINGS
POD0000000656_S0000257 JOY IS HAPPINESS IN GOD
POD0000000656_S0000271 NOT AT ALL
POD0000000656_S0000310 OUR RELATIONSHIP GETS VERY COLD AND DISTANT
POD0000000656_S0000324 THERE'S NO RIGHT WAY TO PRAY OR A WRONG WAY TO PRAY THAT'S ANOTHER GREAT INSIGHT OF IGNATIAN SPIRITUALITY
POD0000000656_S0000345 AS YOU SAY KIND OF DISPELS THESE NOTIONS THAT
POD0000000656_S0000373 ON THE MARGINS AND POPE FRANCIS SAID THAT TO US
POD0000000656_S0000395 AND
POD0000000656_S0000417 I SAW CHRIS ROCK RECENTLY ON SATURDAY NIGHT
POD0000000656_S0000431 SO
POD0000000656_S0000450 AND THE FRANCISCAN SAYS SURE I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT WHAT'S YOUR INTENTION AND HE SAYS I WANT A LEXUS
POD0000000656_S0000469 OUR FUNDING PARTNERS ARE THE FORD FOUNDATION
POD0000000664_S0000006 WE TAKE IN THE WORLD THROUGH HIS EARS
POD0000000664_S0000017 HE'S RECORDED INSIDE SITKA SPRUCE LOGS IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST
POD0000000664_S0000025 STARTED OUT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEN WENT ON TO HAWAII
POD0000000664_S0000038 THE SMELLS OF HAWAII
POD0000000664_S0000046 YOU BEGIN TO PICK UP WHAT I CALL THE MANTRA OF THE ISLANDS AND THAT'S THE DISTANT BEATING OF THAT DRUM CALLED THE PACIFIC OCEAN
POD0000000664_S0000053 BUT I DID ENJOY LISTENING TO ONE THING WHICH IS THAT EVERYBODY WAS COMING TOGETHER FOR A SINGLE PURPOSE AND I PARTICULARLY ENJOYED THE SINGING
POD0000000664_S0000062 IN SEATTLE
POD0000000664_S0000068 PULLED OVER IN A FIELD TO GET SOME REST AND A THUNDERSTORM ROLLED OVER ME
POD0000000664_S0000078 FOR ME
POD0000000664_S0000088 CONNECTS EVERYTHING THAT OUR EARS WORK ALL THE TIME
POD0000000664_S0000096 BUT SOUND IS SO IMPORTANT THAT EVERY HIGHER VERTEBRATE SPECIES HAS THE ABILITY TO HEAR
POD0000000664_S0000104 BUT IF WE WERE TO GO TO A QUIET PLACE
POD0000000664_S0000112 WALK US IN THERE WITH YOU BY SOUND
POD0000000664_S0000125 ADRENALINE-FILLED ASSERTION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE MALE AND WILD
POD0000000664_S0000136 AND IF WE TALK
POD0000000664_S0000144 AND YOU MEAN THAT SILENCE YOU JUST DESCRIBED
POD0000000664_S0000151 THE MODERN MEASURE OF SILENCE IS THE NOISE-FREE INTERVAL
POD0000000664_S0000158 THERE WERE ONLY TWELVE
POD0000000664_S0000167 I THINK A PHYSICIST WILL TELL YOU THAT TRUE SILENCE
POD0000000664_S0000187 THE TONE THE PITCH
POD0000000664_S0000197 WE VERY QUICKLY REALIZE THAT EARTH IS A SOLAR-POWERED JUKEBOX
POD0000000664_S0000208 YEAH
POD0000000664_S0000221 TAKE A PRESCHOOLER
POD0000000664_S0000230 THAT IS OFTEN THE BIG CHALLENGE FOR ADULTS WHEN IT COMES TO SILENCE
POD0000000664_S0000235 AND THAT CAN BE FRIGHTENING
POD0000000664_S0000243 I TAKE A MOMENT OF SILENCE EVERY DAY IN MY LIFE THAT I DON'T TRY TO FILL WITH THOUGHTS
POD0000000664_S0000251 INCLUDING ECOLOGY AND NATURE
POD0000000664_S0000261 HE DEFINES SILENCE NOT AS AN ABSENCE BUT A PRESENCE
POD0000000664_S0000277 STEAM TRAINS THE ENGINEER WHEN HE USES THAT HORN
POD0000000664_S0000288 YOU KNOW LISTENING IS NOT ABOUT SOUND
POD0000000664_S0000296 AND WHAT I CALL MUSIC IS BASICALLY DEFINED AS THIS
POD0000000664_S0000301 MYSELF HAVE I INTERNALIZED IT AM I NOW LIVING OUT THOSE DANCE STEPS JUST IN THE WAY I INTERACT WITH PEOPLE OR CARRY MYSELF DOWN THE PATH
POD0000000664_S0000318 AND THEN I LISTEN TO THE FOLK MUSIC
POD0000000664_S0000330 THAT WE DO ALLOW THEM TO GET TO THAT THROUGH THAT FIRST ONE OR TWO DAYS OF SHEER BOREDOM AND THEN THEY MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT
POD0000000664_S0000335 THEY OVERCOME HOW
POD0000000664_S0000341 SO BOTH MY KIDS
POD0000000664_S0000347 YOU MAKE SOME PRETTY STUNNING STATEMENTS IN YOUR WRITING
POD0000000664_S0000354 WHAT I MEAN EVEN BEYOND THE WORDS
POD0000000664_S0000362 THAT WE ARE LISTENING CREATURES AND THAT THAT SOMEHOW IS
POD0000000664_S0000375 SECURE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN OPEN UP AND BE RECEPTIVE AND TRULY LISTEN
POD0000000664_S0000385 THE BIRD DOESN'T SING FOR OUR BENEFIT SO THERE'S A LOT OF JOY IN THAT LISTENING
POD0000000664_S0000393 LIKE HOW IT IS BEING A PARENT IN THE WORLD THAT IT IS TODAY
POD0000000664_S0000413 WELL RECENTLY IT'S BEEN DISCOVERED THAT CAVE PAINTINGS
POD0000000664_S0000425 HAVE BELIEVED FOR A LONG TIME
POD0000000664_S0000434 AND INDEED
POD0000000664_S0000440 BIRDSONG IS THE PRIMARY INDICATOR OF HABITATS PROSPEROUS TO HUMANS
POD0000000664_S0000446 RIGHT
POD0000000664_S0000456 HIS BOOKS INCLUDE ONE SQUARE INCH OF SILENCE ONE MAN'S QUEST TO PRESERVE QUIET
POD0000000664_S0000467 HELPING TO BUILD THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION FOR A LOVING WORLD
POD0000000672_S0000009 IN A SHORT ENOUGH PERIOD OF TIME AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000000672_S0000024 BUT NO BELIEF
POD0000000672_S0000045 QUEERNESS GAVE ME THE LANGUAGE FOR EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT LIBERATION AND FREEDOM
POD0000000672_S0000066 AND SO CAPITALISM IN ITS CURRENT FORM COULDN'T SURVIVE PATRIARCHY COULDN'T SURVIVE WHITE SUPREMACY COULDN'T SURVIVE IF ENOUGH OF US
POD0000000672_S0000076 TO A FRIEND AS I WAS ON THE WAY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THAT
POD0000000672_S0000085 BUT FOR US TO TRANSFORM AS A SOCIETY WE HAVE TO ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE TRANSFORMED AS INDIVIDUALS AND FOR US TO BE TRANSFORMED AS INDIVIDUALS
POD0000000672_S0000093 THAT THEY MUST BE SUFFERING
POD0000000672_S0000106 A SPIRITUAL TRADITION
POD0000000672_S0000116 OUR OWN SENSE OF OUR EMOTIONS HOW WE INTERPRET ANY GIVEN FEELING
POD0000000672_S0000122 OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPACTING US OUTSIDE
POD0000000672_S0000127 AND FOR THE MOST PART WE ALMOST NEVER GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE THEM AND SORT THROUGH THEM KIND OF LIKE THAT DRAWER THAT COLLECTS EVERYTHING IN YOUR HOUSE I HAVE A FEW OF THOSE
POD0000000672_S0000133 THIS IS NOT MINE THAT'S THE INHERITANCE OF WHITE SUPREMACY
POD0000000672_S0000145 HOW DO I GET THEM TO STOP
POD0000000672_S0000162 YOU ARE A TEACHER YOU ARE STEEPED IN THIS TRADITION
POD0000000672_S0000177 HOW EXTRAORDINARY THAT BLACK PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR
POD0000000672_S0000188 STARING AT A GAGGLE OF WHITE PEOPLE'S FEET
POD0000000672_S0000206 THEY
POD0000000672_S0000227 WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE
POD0000000672_S0000253 IT IS DEVELOPING OUR OWN CAPACITY
POD0000000672_S0000258 IT'S
POD0000000672_S0000279 THAT I
POD0000000672_S0000286 DEFINED BY THE WORK THAT WE DO OR THE PLACE FROM WHICH WE COME
POD0000000672_S0000299 IN CONFRONTATION WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDERSTANDABLY
POD0000000672_S0000308 WHERE WILL I GO
POD0000000672_S0000316 AS MUCH AS WE LOVE OUR EMBODIED TEACHERS THAT COME IN FLESH AND BONE AND SIT ON CUSHIONS
POD0000000672_S0000321 YEAR TO YEAR
POD0000000672_S0000327 IF WE COULD REORIENT IF WE COULD CENTER IN OUR RELATIONSHIP TO OURSELVES AS EVOLVING
POD0000000672_S0000333 THAT IS SPEAKING TO SOMETHING THAT FEELS
POD0000000672_S0000340 TO BE WILLING TO FACE DISCOMFORT AND RECEIVE IT AS OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH AND EXPANSION AND A COMMENTARY ABOUT
POD0000000672_S0000346 SERVES THE GREATER COMMUNITY AND THAT NO ONE THAT IS SUFFERING IS NOT AN INDICATOR OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THE SOCIETY ITSELF IS SUFFERING
POD0000000672_S0000353 WE'RE DIGESTING THE MATERIAL OF HOW INTOLERABLE IT IS TO BE SO INTOLERANT
POD0000000672_S0000371 THEN YOU HAVE A TIPPING POINT AND THE CULTURE BEGINS TO SHIFT
POD0000000672_S0000384 WORKING TO CREATE A FUTURE WHERE UNIVERSAL SPIRITUAL VALUES FORM THE FOUNDATION OF HOW WE CARE FOR OUR COMMON HOME HUMANITY UNITED
POD0000000680_S0000010 AND SHE EMBODIES THIS WRYNESS AND WILDNESS IN HER LESSER-KNOWN SPIRITUAL PRACTICE AS A DEVOUT CATHOLIC
POD0000000680_S0000024 A LOT OF TERROR
POD0000000680_S0000059 BUT LAST NIGHT YOU WERE WAGGING FIREARMS IN OUR KITCHEN MOM
POD0000000680_S0000076 AND IF IN THOSE MOMENTS OF TERROR OR JUDGMENT
POD0000000680_S0000101 YOU SPOKE IN A SIMILAR WAY IN THIS BOOK NOW GO OUT THERE
POD0000000680_S0000123 AND IF YOU CAN GET CURIOUS ABOUT IT
POD0000000680_S0000140 MAKE THIS STOP IF YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO OCCUPY IT
POD0000000680_S0000158 RIGHT
POD0000000680_S0000174 TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING SMALL AND SIMPLE AND AS TRUE AS POSSIBLE REALLY IN SOME WAYS
POD0000000680_S0000186 TAKING IN THE NATURAL PEACE AND EASE OF YOUR MIND
POD0000000680_S0000204 AFTER TALKING TO THIS MAN FOR A WHILE HE LEANED FORWARD AND HE SAID TO HIM
POD0000000680_S0000216 THE MORE THAT JUST KIND OF SETTLES TO THE BOTTOM
POD0000000680_S0000230 TODAY I'M WITH THE POET AND MEMOIRIST MARY KARR
POD0000000680_S0000236 BEING BAPTIZED IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
POD0000000680_S0000260 AND
POD0000000680_S0000281 I KNOW RIGHT
POD0000000680_S0000289 YOU CALLED AND CRIED TO ME TO BREAK OPEN MY DEAFNESS AND YOU SENT FORTH YOUR BEAMS AND YOU SHONE UPON ME AND CHASED AWAY MY BLINDNESS
POD0000000680_S0000318 AS HUMAN BEINGS BUT THIS GRISLY AWFUL MORBID THING
POD0000000680_S0000336 AND IN IGNATIAN SPIRITUALITY THERE'S A THING YOU DO WHERE YOU COMPOSE A SCENE WITH YOUR BODY WITH ALL THE SENSES
POD0000000680_S0000351 AND SOMEWHERE IN THERE
POD0000000680_S0000369 I'M HAVING A HARD-ENOUGH TIME JUST GETTING THROUGH THE DAY
POD0000000680_S0000385 UNLESS YOU HAVE EMPATHY FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR OWN SUFFERING AND YOUR OWN PECCADILLOES
POD0000000680_S0000395 YOU WRITE NONE OF US CAN EVER KNOW THE VALUE OF OUR LIVES OR HOW OUR SEPARATE AND SILENT SCRIBBLING MAY ADD TO THE AMENITY OF THE WORLD IF ONLY BY HOW RADICALLY IT CHANGES US ONE AND BY ONE
POD0000000680_S0000406 I THINK TO HOPE THAN TO LIVE IN THE DESPAIR I WAS BORN TO
POD0000000680_S0000421 WELL

POD0000000688_S0000040 AND
POD0000000688_S0000055 AND THAT WE GROW UP OR WE'RE EDUCATED IN A WORLD THAT
POD0000000688_S0000060 I THINK THAT WHEN I FIRST STARTED MAKING THINGS OUT OF CLOTH IT WAS LIKE IT WAS ANOTHER SKIN
POD0000000688_S0000076 I THINK SOMETIMES WE'RE VERY BUSY GIVING
POD0000000688_S0000083 YOU HAVE TO KIND OF CULTIVATE THE SPACE AROUND YOU WHERE YOU CAN TRUST THE THING THAT YOU CAN'T NAME
POD0000000688_S0000090 AND CAN BECOME REALLY ARTICULATE
POD0000000688_S0000113 I DON'T KNOW STRUCTURING THE WORK IN SOME WAY WHERE EVERY ACT OF IT IS IN SOME WAYS TRANSPARENTLY PRESENT IN THE MATERIAL
POD0000000688_S0000135 HOW I START PROJECTS IS
POD0000000688_S0000141 BECAUSE I RESPOND TO SPACES
POD0000000688_S0000178 YES
POD0000000688_S0000191 YOU KNOW AND THAT IF YOU CAN DO THAT IF YOU CAN LET YOURSELF FAIL IF YOU CAN LET YOURSELF BE REALLY BAD
POD0000000688_S0000207 AND IT WAS INTERESTING TO THEN
POD0000000688_S0000227 TELL ME ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH TECHNOLOGY
POD0000000688_S0000251 OR FIFTY THOUSAND CATALOGUE CARDS AT THE SAN FRANCISCO MAIN LIBRARY
POD0000000688_S0000259 SO
POD0000000688_S0000270 I BECAME INTERESTED IN THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE SENSE IS DISPLACED TO ANOTHER PART OF THE BODY SO IF THE SENSE OF SIGHT IS JOINED TO THE PLACE OF VOICE
POD0000000688_S0000285 SINGULAR ACT OF MAKING HAVE ANY CONSEQUENCE
POD0000000688_S0000295 BUT WHEN I HAVE YOU BEEN THERE YOU WALK UP TO THE WALL AND HERE'S THE THING
POD0000000688_S0000309 THROUGH PHYSICAL LABOR LEAVES A TRANSPARENT PRESENCE IN MATERIAL
POD0000000688_S0000320 YOUR YOUR BODY IS AWARE OF THOSE THINGS AND
POD0000000688_S0000341 I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT IS BEHIND A LOT OF THE THINGS I'M WORKING ON IS
POD0000000688_S0000358 HOW THE INVISIBLE AFFECTS US AND HOW THE VISIBLE CAN BE VEILED AND IT'S SUCH A WONDERFUL IMAGE AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO IT SO WE'LL JUST LET IT SIT THERE
POD0000000688_S0000369 IN SOME WAYS
POD0000000688_S0000391 OF THIS
POD0000000688_S0000418 AND
POD0000000688_S0000439 THAT WORDS ALSO CARRY ALL OF THOSE HISTORIES
POD0000000688_S0000468 AND HE HAD BEEN TO AN ART EVENT AT THE WEXNER CENTER
POD0000000688_S0000493 TOGETHER
POD0000000688_S0000509 ALSO NICOLE ROME AND NICOLE GIBBS FROM ANN HAMILTON'S STUDIO
POD0000000696_S0000012 I THINK POETRY EVOLVED TO SAVE US FROM OURSELVES
POD0000000696_S0000017 AND HE SAID WE COULD CERTAINLY USE MORE OF THAT NOWADAYS
POD0000000696_S0000027 BEING A POET IS THAT I KNOW THAT I WAS PREPARED FOR IT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE
POD0000000696_S0000035 WAS ALWAYS HIGH AND EVERYONE WAS AWARE THAT THEY WERE DOING IT
POD0000000696_S0000054 I WANTED MORE THAN ANYTHING TO BE ABLE TO GIVE ALL OF MYSELF TO MY POEMS
POD0000000696_S0000062 WE HAVE TO BE FREE
POD0000000696_S0000067 ALL OF YOUR BELIEFS
POD0000000696_S0000075 AND YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD TIME
POD0000000696_S0000087 REMEMBER WHEN
POD0000000696_S0000093 YOLK RUNS ALL OVER THE PLATE A RUBBER BAND BINDS THE MORNING PAPER MY FATHER'S EMBRACE TIGHTENS
POD0000000696_S0000108 WHEN WE FALL IN LOVE
POD0000000696_S0000120 OR THEN IF WE CAN'T DO EITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS TO MOVE AWAY
POD0000000696_S0000131 AND NOBODY'S LIVING AN EASY LIFE
POD0000000696_S0000146 EVERY LOVE POEM IS POLITICAL
POD0000000696_S0000160 WE HAVE TO TAKE PEOPLE DOWN TO SOME KIND OF IDENTITY
POD0000000696_S0000181 AND PEOPLE HAVE THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLITICAL IN POEMS
POD0000000696_S0000194 YOU WERE GONNA ASK ME ABOUT IT
POD0000000696_S0000202 I'M NOT CHOSEN
POD0000000696_S0000208 HELL I REMEMBER HIM SAYING THE WORD SIEGE WHEN A RASH RETURNED
POD0000000696_S0000228 WHICH WAS
POD0000000696_S0000234 BECAUSE EVERYBODY ENJOYS THEIR ANONYMITY
POD0000000696_S0000249 IT'S NOT IN EVERY POEM BUT IT'S THERE AND THEN THIS OTHER BOOK KEPT BEING ABOUT THIS
POD0000000696_S0000274 BUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT
POD0000000696_S0000301 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT AND THIS IS ON BEING
POD0000000696_S0000322 OH THAT'S A NICE WORD
POD0000000696_S0000337 BUT WHEN YOU'RE A POET EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS LIKE
POD0000000696_S0000349 I LOVE BLACK WOMEN WHO PLANT FLOWERS AS SHEEPISH AS THEIR SONS
POD0000000696_S0000354 TOSS HIM IN A TRUCK
POD0000000696_S0000359 MY GOD
POD0000000696_S0000373 THAT'S A SURPRISE
POD0000000696_S0000387 BUT NOT THINKING ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING
POD0000000696_S0000395 AND I START ASKING IT QUESTIONS
POD0000000696_S0000408 EXACTLY
POD0000000696_S0000436 ONLY A CREATIVE PEOPLE CAN WIELD IT COME ON CREATIVE PEOPLE
POD0000000696_S0000457 DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
POD0000000696_S0000464 SOMETHING THAT WE ARE DOING SOME CHILD THAT WE LOVE AND THAT I THINK IF WE CAN CONCENTRATE
POD0000000696_S0000473 MY MAN AND I HOLD OUR BREATHS
POD0000000696_S0000478 ONLY MEMORY MAKES US KNEEL
POD0000000696_S0000483 THEN HEADS COVERED
POD0000000696_S0000494 OUR LOVELY THEME MUSIC IS PROVIDED AND COMPOSED BY ZOE KEATING
POD0000000704_S0000009 AND WHEN YOU FIND A SOLUTION OR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SOLUTION
POD0000000704_S0000027 YOU KNOW AND INITIALLY I LOOKED FOR ANSWERS SO TO SPEAK
POD0000000704_S0000045 THE PROPORTION OR THE DISPROPORTION
POD0000000704_S0000061 FASCINATED WITH THIS IDEA OF UNIFICATION WHICH WAS AN IDEA OF EINSTEIN
POD0000000704_S0000075 I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
POD0000000704_S0000090 I LOOK AT THINGS MUCH MORE AS A STATE OF FLUX
POD0000000704_S0000105 BUT WE'RE PIOUS TOWARD SCIENCE
POD0000000704_S0000118 TOGETHER WITH NOVELIST AND ESSAYIST MARILYNNE ROBINSON
POD0000000704_S0000134 IS DESCRIPTIVE
POD0000000704_S0000149 AND WHAT HAPPENED
POD0000000704_S0000158 RIGHT I MEAN
POD0000000704_S0000170 EVERYONE WANTS TO HAVE A NARRATIVE OF PERSONAL ORIGINS
POD0000000704_S0000179 YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT
POD0000000704_S0000195 JUST LIKE WE ARE RIGHT
POD0000000704_S0000209 TODAY THE MYSTERY WE ARE
POD0000000704_S0000214 HE'S ALSO THE AUTHOR OF POETIC BOOKS ABOUT SCIENCE
POD0000000704_S0000229 SO HE INVOKED GOD GOD WAS A VERY
POD0000000704_S0000242 THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TRUE AND THE MOMENT THAT THEY FIND OUT THAT ALL MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN
POD0000000704_S0000254 I THINK YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAYING THAT TO DISMISS THAT VERY ANCIENT AND PERVASIVE ASPECT OF HUMAN LIFE AND HUMAN CULTURE IS IRRATIONAL ON SOME LEVEL YES

POD0000000728_S0000072 BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE PUBLISHERS UNDERSTAND THE TRADEOFF THEY'RE MAKING AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE SOCIAL POSITIONING OF TECHNOLOGY AS NEUTRAL
POD0000000728_S0000087 JOURNALISM SCHOOL MEDICAL SCHOOL
POD0000000728_S0000101 THE IDEA THAT THE HALO AROUND TECH AS THE GOOD GUYS IS GONNA SUSTAIN SEEMS INCREASINGLY UNLIKELY
POD0000000728_S0000112 BUT WE KEPT HOPING THAT THIS WASN'T REALLY HAPPENING WE AIDED AND ABETTED THE MEDIA'S SUICIDE
POD0000000728_S0000135 IT WAS NOT REAL

POD0000000728_S0000173 AND THE DECISION TO MAKE THAT PURCHASE
POD0000000728_S0000179 AND THEY REALLY WANT TO DEPLOY THEIR RESOURCES AND COMMIT TO IT
POD0000000728_S0000208 AND HOW

POD0000000736_S0000118 AND STUDS TERKEL FOUND THAT WHEN GIVEN A CHANCE TO REFLECT
POD0000000736_S0000123 OF THE QUESTIONS OF MEANING SUCH EXPERIENCES ALWAYS SEEM TO RAISE
POD0000000736_S0000130 I'M SURE IT DID TO SOME EXTENT

POD0000000744_S0000203 AGRICULTURE ICONIC NEW ENGLAND LANDSCAPE THAT'S TWENTY FIVE MILES FROM MANHATTAN
POD0000000744_S0000227 HOW DO WE NOURISH THIS WAY OF THINKING FOR A WIDER PART OF THE POPULATION
POD0000000744_S0000246 AND MY ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS ARE DICTATING THAT WE EAT A LOT OF MEAT BECAUSE WE'RE GRASSLAND
POD0000000744_S0000259 YOU'RE EATING MEAT THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT THERE IS NO HEALTHY ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM THAT I'VE EVER SEEN THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE ANIMALS
POD0000000744_S0000284 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT RABBI DENNIS SASSO IS MODERATING QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE

POD0000000752_S0000033 THAN I THINK IT DID TO MY PARENTS OR ANYONE ALMOST ANYONE ELSE IN MY FAMILY
POD0000000752_S0000042 AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED TO ME THAT I WOULD ENJOY WORK AS PUBLIC AS TEACHING IS
POD0000000752_S0000058 I WOULD SAY IS THAT I WATCHED THE PLACE I LOVED MOST CHANGE OVER THE EARLY DECADES OF MY LIFE AND CHANGE IN WAYS THAT I THINK WE NOW ALL RECOGNIZE ARE PROBABLY NOT SUSTAINABLE
POD0000000752_S0000072 YOU MAY EVEN HAVE BEEN IN THE CLASS BUT
POD0000000752_S0000079 AND I WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF DOING THAT I WAS SIMPLY AWARE OF TALKING MY WAY THROUGH EACH BOOK OF THE BIBLE
POD0000000752_S0000087 OBLIVIOUSNESS THAT CHARACTERIZES OUR CULTURE
POD0000000752_S0000096 NOW I CONTINUE TO FIND THAT EVEN READING CHAPTERS PASSAGES THAT I'VE WRITTEN ON BEFORE
POD0000000752_S0000104 THE FIRST CHAPTER OF GENESIS IS AS ELLEN DAVIS PUTS IT
POD0000000752_S0000115 SO YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE INTERESTING FOR US TO DO IS JUST PICK UP GENESIS
POD0000000752_S0000122 LET THERE BE LIGHT AND THERE WAS LIGHT LET THERE BE A FIRMAMENT IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS AND IT WAS SO

POD0000000752_S0000151 THAT THIS IS THE FIRST AND MAYBE THE BEST CLUE THAT WE HAVE OF WHAT IT MEANS FOR HUMANS TO EXERCISE SKILLED MASTERY AMONGST THE CREATURES
POD0000000752_S0000165 THAT IN WHILE THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND HAS IN MANY WAYS BECOME WORSE
POD0000000752_S0000175 WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF SEXUALITY
POD0000000752_S0000181 GOD SAW THAT IT WAS GOOD
POD0000000752_S0000188 YOU KNOW WE KNOW FROM OUR OWN SMALLER CREATIONS
POD0000000752_S0000197 LANGUAGE THAT SPEAKS TO OUR HEARTS
POD0000000752_S0000206 BUT IT IS NOT THE DISCURSIVE LANGUAGE OF MERE FACT
POD0000000752_S0000214 WELL ESPECIALLY WENDELL BERRY
POD0000000752_S0000221 IN ORDER TO BE THE CREATURES THAT IN FACT WE ARE

POD0000000752_S0000280 HOW WE EAT AND DRINK
POD0000000752_S0000287 BUT IT'S THE QUESTION OF POSSESSION CAN NEVER BE SEPARATED FROM THE QUESTION OF CARE
POD0000000752_S0000298 UM
POD0000000752_S0000304 I SOMETIMES SAY TO MY STUDENTS THE BEST WAY TO FIND YOUR PREACHING ANGLE FOR ANY TEXT IS TO ASK HOW IT CHALLENGES OR TURNS ON ITS HEAD YOUR ORDINARY WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HOW THINGS REALLY ARE
POD0000000752_S0000313 AND SPIRIT TIRES WITH FLESH
POD0000000752_S0000318 AND I REMEMBER HERE A TALE OF EVIL TWINED WITH GOOD

POD0000000760_S0000028 GO INTO MYSELF AND NOT EVEN TRY TO SHOW ADULTS THAT I WAS INDEED
POD0000000760_S0000058 LANGUAGE WASN'T THAT IMPORTANT
POD0000000760_S0000077 I ALWAYS APPRECIATED SCIENCE MORE THAN ANY OTHER COURSE I STUDIED BECAUSE TO ME
POD0000000760_S0000107 I WAS ABLE TO MEET A TIBETAN WHO HAD COME DOWN FROM THAT REGION HAVING TAKEN MORE THAN A MONTH WALK TO COME DOWN
POD0000000760_S0000125 AND FROM THIS REMOTE AREA IN NORTHERN MYANMAR
POD0000000760_S0000147 HE EXPANDED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANIMAL-HUMAN BOND AND MADE AN INTIMACY WITH REMOTE PLACES IN THE HUMAN SPIRIT PART OF HIS ADVENTURE AND HIS WISDOM

POD0000000760_S0000217 HE WOULD TAKE ME TO THE BRONX ZOO

POD0000000760_S0000289 WHICH HAS NO CURE AT THIS TIME
POD0000000760_S0000308 NEVER WAKE UP A DAY AND SIT BACK AND THINKING THIS IS ENOUGH ALL I EVER DO IS THINK OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVEN'T DONE YET AND THAT STILL NEED DOING
POD0000000760_S0000317 THE GENERALS SAY TO ME BECAUSE THEY'VE READ ABOUT IT AND THEY'VE HEARD ABOUT IT AND THEY SAY

POD0000000768_S0000175 ESPECIALLY IN A TIME LIKE WE'RE EXPERIENCING NOW WHERE PEOPLE YOU KNOW HAVE FELT INVULNERABLE TO CHANGE BUT ANYONE WHO REALLY LOOKS DEEPLY INTO LIFE KNOWS THAT LIFE CAN CHANGE ON A DIME

POD0000000768_S0000386 SHE DIDN'T COME AT THAT WORK AS A RELIGIOUS PERSON OR THINKER
POD0000000768_S0000395 SO THAT A HUGE PART OF OUR JOB IS HELPING FOLKS UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR LIBERATION IS TIED UP IN EVERYONE ELSE'S NO MATTER HOW POWERFUL THEY THINK THEY ARE

POD0000000776_S0000185 I THINK BACK THEN I WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE FREDERICK DOUGLASS'S MOTHER I WOULD'VE BARED ONE OF MY SCARS LIKE THE ONE ON MY KNEE FROM A BIT OF FLYING CHARCOAL AT A COOKOUT WHEN I WAS SIX
POD0000000776_S0000190 IN THE CATHOLIC TRADITION THERE IS A FORM OF GRACE THE SANCTIFYING ONE
POD0000000776_S0000197 BUT THE GRACE IS THE BIGGER PART

POD0000000800_S0000067 HE GAVE UP RUNNING NOW A FEW YEARS AGO HE STARTED AGAIN
POD0000000800_S0000072 BUT IT WAS USELESS UNTIL HE ACTUALIZED IT
POD0000000808_S0000020 WHAT THEY SAY CAN BE MOST UNIVERSALLY HEARD AND FELT
POD0000000808_S0000031 I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
POD0000000808_S0000041 WHICH IS LOCATED ON DAKOTA LAND
POD0000000816_S0000014 WE TAKE A FRESH LOOK AT HIS LIFE AND WORK
POD0000000816_S0000019 DARWIN IT TURNS OUT DID NOT ARGUE AGAINST GOD
POD0000000816_S0000030 HE GREW UP IN THE WORLD OF JANE AUSTEN'S NOVELS
POD0000000816_S0000036 BUT HE WAS ALSO A PASSIONATE AMATEUR NATURALIST
POD0000000816_S0000042 HOW HAVE ALL THESE EXQUISITE ADAPTATIONS OF ONE PART OF THE ORGANIZATION TO ANOTHER PART
POD0000000816_S0000052 WE SEE BEAUTIFUL ADAPTATIONS EVERYWHERE
POD0000000816_S0000058 HE GREW UP IN A CHRISTIAN FUNDAMENTALIST HOME IN CHICAGO
POD0000000816_S0000063 AND HE ONCE WROTE TO A FRIEND THAT THIS FELT LIKE CONFESSING A MURDER
POD0000000816_S0000068 PEOPLE KNEW THEIR PLACES THINGS WERE CHANGING
POD0000000816_S0000074 SPECIES DID NOT CHANGE SPONTANEOUSLY AND NATURALLY
POD0000000816_S0000081 CHRISTIANS AND JEWS AND MUSLIMS ARE ALL CREATIONISTS BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT GOD BROUGHT THE WORLD INTO EXISTENCE
POD0000000816_S0000088 HERE ARE SOME VERSES
POD0000000816_S0000101 THE ORIGINAL PAIR OF EVERY SPECIES HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE NOT SO LONG AGO BY GOD
POD0000000816_S0000111 PEOPLE BEGAN TO BUILD UP A PICTURE OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVERSITY OF LIFE ON EARTH
POD0000000816_S0000122 IT CANNOT ADD UP AND PERCEIVE THE FULL EFFECTS OF MANY SLIGHT VARIATIONS ACCUMULATED DURING AN ALMOST INFINITE NUMBER OF GENERATIONS
POD0000000816_S0000128 BUT IN REALITY
POD0000000816_S0000135 AS RELIGION AND SCIENCE WERE JOINED AND THEN THERE STARTS TO BE A DIVIDE
POD0000000816_S0000145 AND THESE LAWS PRODUCE THE FORMS OF LIFE THAT WE OBSERVE
POD0000000816_S0000153 THE TWO BOOKS FOR FRANCIS BACON ARE THE WORD OF GOD AND THE WORKS OF GOD
POD0000000816_S0000164 WERE ALSO EXPECTED TO SUPPLY EVIDENCES OF GOD'S BENEFICENCE
POD0000000816_S0000171 AND SO FORTH
POD0000000816_S0000178 HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN ONE CORNER OF ONE CULTURE IN WESTERN EUROPE
POD0000000816_S0000189 SUBLIME DEVOTION THE PREVALENT FEELING
POD0000000816_S0000197 HE HEARS WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS ANIMAL-LIKE SOUNDS COMING FROM THESE PEOPLE HE HAD NO CONCEPT THAT ANY LANGUAGE COULD BE EXPRESSED IN THAT WAY
POD0000000816_S0000204 AND IT PLANTED A THOUGHT IN HIS MIND THAT NEVER WENT AWAY HOW CAN YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE DIVERSITY OF HUMAN RACES AND THEN
POD0000000816_S0000214 HE WAS ASKED WHAT STUCK IN HIS MIND ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCES IN SOUTH AMERICA AND ON THE BEAGLE
POD0000000816_S0000223 IT WAS THE RAINFOREST
POD0000000816_S0000229 BOTH ARE TEMPLES FILLED WITH THE VARIED PRODUCTIONS OF THE GOD OF NATURE
POD0000000816_S0000237 OUR WEB SITE PRESENTS THESE RARE SKETCHES AND PAINTINGS IN INCREDIBLE DETAIL
POD0000000816_S0000244 SPEAKING OF FAITH COMES TO YOU FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA
POD0000000816_S0000254 ANY THEORY THAT DENIES THE STORY OF THE DIVINE CREATION OF MAN AS TAUGHT IN THE BIBLE AND TO TEACH INSTEAD THAT MAN HAS DESCENDED FROM A LOWER ORDER OF ANIMALS
POD0000000816_S0000259 DARWIN SENSED NOTHING NATURAL AND BENEVOLENT IN THE VICTORIAN IDEA OF A CREATOR GOD WHO HAD FIXED EVERY CONDITION OF LIFE ONCE AND FOR ALL AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME
POD0000000816_S0000268 YOU CAN SEE THIS ON EVERY STREET CORNER
POD0000000816_S0000273 IF YOU GAVE THEM FOOD SO THE THEORY WENT AT THAT TIME THIS WAS VERY MIDDLE-CLASS THEORY THEY WOULD SIMPLY PRODUCE MORE BABIES PAUPER BOYS AND GIRLS COULD EAT WELL ENOUGH TO REPRODUCE AND THE BURDEN ON MIDDLE-CLASS TAXPAYERS BECOMES GREATER AND GREATER AS THE YEARS GO BY
POD0000000816_S0000290 LOTS OF CHRISTIANS BELIEVE THAT MALTHUS BELIEVED THAT
POD0000000816_S0000298 WHAT GOOD CAN COME FOR THEM IS PROGRESS
POD0000000816_S0000303 THAT NOT ONLY THAT THERE WERE ALL THE FORMS IN NATURE BUT I THINK THE SOCIAL ORDER OF SOCIETY
POD0000000816_S0000309 EACH CATASTROPHE
POD0000000816_S0000315 WAYS OF GOING ABOUT EXISTENCE THAT GOD HAD ESTABLISHED AT THE OUTSET OF CREATION ABOUT WHICH DARWIN DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY REALLY AND
POD0000000816_S0000335 I DO THIS DESIGNEDLY
POD0000000816_S0000341 I BELIEVE THAT THE MAN AND THE GNAT ARE IN THE SAME PREDICAMENT
POD0000000816_S0000355 AND COVERS THE SURFACE WITH ITS EVER BRANCHING AND BEAUTIFUL RAMIFICATIONS
POD0000000816_S0000369 MOUNTAINS MOVE UP BY SMALL INCREMENTS
POD0000000816_S0000374 FOR AN HOUR AT A TIME
POD0000000816_S0000385 DARWIN ABHORRED CRUELTY TO ANIMALS
POD0000000816_S0000400 AND DURING HIS TRIP
POD0000000816_S0000411 THEIR MINISTERS
POD0000000816_S0000423 I THINK HUMAN FEAR IS UNDERSTANDABLE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND PREDICTABLE
POD0000000816_S0000435 SO YOU KNOW I WAS BROUGHT UP PARTLY SOME OF THE INTELLECTUAL INFLUENCES IN MY LIFE WERE OF THAT CONSPIRATORIAL NATURE
POD0000000816_S0000444 IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT HE WAS NOT A PROFESSIONAL THEOLOGIAN OR A PHILOSOPHER FOR SURE
POD0000000816_S0000452 HERE IN CLOSING
POD0000000816_S0000457 NAMELY
POD0000000816_S0000462 FROM SO SIMPLE A BEGINNING ENDLESS FORMS MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MOST WONDERFUL HAVE BEEN
POD0000000816_S0000470 ON OUR WEB SITE VIEW THE HAND OF DARWIN
POD0000000824_S0000006 IN THE FRONT LINE OF LEADERS SURROUNDING MARTIN LUTHER KING JR
POD0000000824_S0000011 AS INSTRUCTIVE FOR US NOW IS THE WAY HESCHEL EMBODIED THE PASSIONATE SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT OF THE PROPHETS
POD0000000824_S0000016 I WOULD SAY ABOUT INDIVIDUALS
POD0000000824_S0000031 HE BECAME BEST KNOWN IN AMERICAN CULTURE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY S
POD0000000824_S0000043 IT WOULD BE MORE HONEST TO BLAME RELIGION FOR ITS OWN DEFEATS
POD0000000824_S0000048 INSIPID
POD0000000824_S0000056 IN AN OFFICE SURROUNDED BY BOOKS FLOOR-TO-CEILING BOOKS WITH BARELY ENOUGH ROOM TO STAND OR SIT
POD0000000824_S0000062 I THINK TRIED TO AVOID THE QUESTION
POD0000000824_S0000071 AND HE SAID THIS IS SOMEHOW SCANDALOUS IT'S BEYOND LOGIC HOW COULD IT BE THAT THE GREAT GOD OF ALL THE WORLD CARES ABOUT INDIVIDUALS AND
POD0000000824_S0000082 MAN IS NOT ALONE WHICH WAS PUBLISHED THREE YEARS BEFORE GOD IN SEARCH OF MAN
POD0000000824_S0000092 DELVING INTO HIM
POD0000000824_S0000107 WHO IS THE LORD THAT I SHOULD HEED HIS VOICE AND LET ISRAEL GO
POD0000000824_S0000117 THE ASSEMBLY GREETED KING BY SINGING WE SHALL OVERCOME IN HEBREW
POD0000000824_S0000124 TO WHICH THEY BOTH TESTIFIED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION
POD0000000824_S0000129 AND YOU READ KING
POD0000000824_S0000135 OF PURSUING A CAREER IN THE ACADEMY AS A PROFESSOR OF THEOLOGY
POD0000000824_S0000142 AND YET BOTH OF THEM SPOKE OF GOD'S PRESENCE IN THEIR LIVES I REMEMBER A SERMON THAT KING GAVE
POD0000000824_S0000149 WHAT HE DID DO WAS TESTIFY TO GOD'S PRESENCE IN HIS LIFE AS A SOURCE OF HOPE AND COURAGE
POD0000000824_S0000160 I THINK THE WAY TO GO IS MORE THE WAY HESCHEL WENT
POD0000000824_S0000171 IT INCLUDED THESE WORDS PAROCHIALISM HAS BECOME UNTENABLE
POD0000000824_S0000178 AND WORKING WITH AND SPEAKING WITH ABOUT IMPORTANT THINGS PEOPLE OF OTHER FAITHS
POD0000000824_S0000184 WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE AN EXPERIENCE OF GOD THAT GOES BEYOND LANGUAGE THAT GOES BEYOND CULTURE THAT PROVES TO THEM THE UNITY OF THE DIVINE AND THEN THEY UNDERSTAND VARIOUS RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS AS WAYS AS IT WERE OF PUTTING THIS EXPERIENCE INTO WORDS AND THE WORDS ALWAYS FALL SHORT
POD0000000824_S0000191 THAN HE IS
POD0000000824_S0000198 WHERE ALL FORMULATIONS AND ARTICULATIONS APPEAR AS UNDERSTATEMENTS
POD0000000824_S0000210 JUST AS WE ARE COMMANDED TO LOVE MAN WE ARE ALSO CALLED UPON TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE GRANDEUR OF GOD'S CREATION
POD0000000824_S0000216 THE REAL PROBLEM BIBLICALLY SPEAKING
POD0000000824_S0000229 THIS IS THE LAST INTERVIEW HESCHEL WOULD GIVE
POD0000000824_S0000249 MY GUEST ARNOLD EISEN IS CHANCELLOR THERE
POD0000000824_S0000259 IS LAPSE FROM PLURALISM INTO RELATIVISM
POD0000000824_S0000271 SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER MY INTERVIEW WITH HIM
POD0000000824_S0000277 I FELT THAT SOMEHOW IT WASN'T WORTH HIS DIGNITY TO KNOCK ON THE DOORS OF THOSE CONGRESSMEN HE SHOULD BE IN HIS STUDY THINKING GREAT THOUGHTS
POD0000000824_S0000287 WE'RE AWARE EVERY MOMENT OF THE TIME
POD0000000824_S0000293 AND THEY HAVE TO BE REMINDED OF THEIR GUILT AND THEY HAVE TO BE STOPPED BUT ALL ARE RESPONSIBLE AND SO IT'S OUR JOB
POD0000000824_S0000310 I DON'T HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT HESCHEL WOULD BE ENGAGED IN ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH MUSLIMS
POD0000000824_S0000325 OH
POD0000000824_S0000338 ABSOLUTELY INDISPENSABLE
POD0000000824_S0000350 WHATEVER AGE YOU ARE YOU HAVE A SOUL YOU HAVE A SPIRIT YOU HAVE A HEART YOU HAVE A MIND USE THEM
POD0000000824_S0000362 YIDDISH
POD0000000824_S0000370 WE STAMMER AND SAY GOD WHO IS MORE THAN ALL THERE IS WHO SPEAKS THROUGH THE INEFFABLE
POD0000000824_S0000376 BUT A SET OF PRINCIPLES BY WHICH ONE CAN LIVE KNOW THAT LIFE IS SERIOUS KNOW THAT GOD IS IN OUR WORLD
POD0000000824_S0000382 AND THEN GO OUT THERE AND MAKE SURE THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE ABLE TO EAT AND BREATHE AND FIGHT OFF DISEASE AND SO APPRECIATE GOD'S WONDER IN THE WORLD
POD0000000824_S0000395 START WORKING ON THIS GREAT WORK OF ART CALLED YOUR OWN EXISTENCE
POD0000000832_S0000007 FOR US
POD0000000832_S0000016 THROUGH THE LENS THROUGH THE APPROACH OF WORKING WITH INITIALLY WHEN YOU STARTED AT A VERY YOUNG AGE MUSLIM YOUNG PEOPLE AND FAMILIES IN CRISIS OR WHO WERE VULNERABLE IN THE INNER CITY
POD0000000832_S0000032 AND I FEEL LIKE FOR THE TWO OF YOU
POD0000000832_S0000045 AND I GOT A CHANCE TO APPRECIATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY WRESTLED
POD0000000832_S0000084 IT'S KING WRESTLING I ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF THE CLAIMS OF BLACK POWER I FEEL IT I SEE IT I'VE EXPERIENCED IT
POD0000000832_S0000102 FOR US
POD0000000832_S0000126 HE SCREAMED
POD0000000832_S0000144 WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY CONFRONTING THE ANGER WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY TAKING THEMSELVES TO THAT EMPATHIC EXPERIENCE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S PAIN
POD0000000832_S0000156 AND
POD0000000832_S0000171 YOU CAN ALWAYS LISTEN AGAIN AND HEAR THE UNEDITED VERSION OF EVERY SHOW WE DO ON THE ON BEING PODCAST FEED WHEREVER YOU FIND YOUR PODCASTS
POD0000000832_S0000178 HE'S RECENTLY BECOME THE FIRST EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ON BEING'S CIVIL CONVERSATIONS PROJECT
POD0000000832_S0000184 THIS DYNAMIC AND OF COURSE IT'S EXTREMELY INTENSE IN JERUSALEM AND IN MANY PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU WORK LUCAS BUT IT'S HERE NOW TOO THAT THERE'S ALL THIS FEAR
POD0000000832_S0000201 I WAS WALKING AROUND TALKING I WAS IN THE BAPTIST STUDENT UNION AT THE TIME AND I WAS WALKING WITH A YOUNG WHITE WOMAN WHO WAS ALSO IN THE BSU AND WE WERE WALKING AROUND CAMPUS AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
POD0000000832_S0000212 I'M ASSUMING THEY'RE LOOKING AT ME AT THIS POINT

POD0000000840_S0000061 THEY WANT THEIR FOOTPRINT ON EARTH
POD0000000840_S0000068 AND WITH LOTS OF STRATEGY AND WITH LOTS OF IDEAS OF HOW YOU RECRUIT YOUNG PEOPLE AND GET THEM TO THINK THAT THIS IS THE BEST WAY THEY CAN IMPACT THE WORLD IF YOU LOOK AT BIN LADEN'S WRITING AND SPEAKING HE SPECIFICALLY ARTICULATES

POD0000000840_S0000090 FOR SOME REASON EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT ALMOST
POD0000000840_S0000103 BUT HE ALSO SAYS YOU SHOULD BE A LIGHT UNTO ALL NATIONS AND YOU SHOULD HELP EVERYONE EQUALLY AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY PREVALENT FOR THIS GROUP
POD0000000840_S0000126 THESE INSTINCTS HE SAYS ARE FAILING US AS OUR SOCIETIES GROW MORE PLURALISTIC
POD0000000840_S0000132 WE MUST BE DISCREET EVEN SILENT ABOUT OUR OWN

POD0000000840_S0000202 AND IT WAS EXTREMELY MOVING AND SUBSTANTIVE AND INTERESTING AND UNPREDICTABLE AND I'M THINKING ALSO THAT THERE WAS IN THAT GROUP AND IT WAS A RANGE OF KIDS FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC AND I THINK THERE WAS ALSO A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS ATHEIST OR NOT RELIGIOUS IS THAT RIGHT

POD0000000840_S0000343 CAN WE COACH EACH OTHER'S SON'S OR DAUGHTER'S LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM

POD0000000840_S0000382 THAT CONVERSATION EXISTS

POD0000000848_S0000004 REZA ASLAN OPENS A REFRESHING WINDOW ON RELIGION IN THE WORLD AND ISLAM IN PARTICULAR
POD0000000848_S0000021 MY FATHER WHO'S NEVER TRUSTED ANYONE WEARING A TURBAN DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM FOR A MINUTE AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA FOR US TO LEAVE IRAN UNTIL THINGS SETTLED DOWN
POD0000000848_S0000040 WHAT WAS AMAZING TO ME WAS AS MY SORT OF BELIEF IN EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANITY BEGAN TO CRUMBLE
POD0000000848_S0000054 AT ANOTHER TIME
POD0000000848_S0000069 SO TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE
POD0000000848_S0000080 THE PASSING OF INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY INTO INDIVIDUAL HANDS
POD0000000848_S0000089 AND THEY CAN COME UP WITH THEIR OWN INTERPRETATIONS AND OF COURSE
POD0000000848_S0000097 WE JUST LOOK AT THE MUSLIM WORLD WE SEE VIOLENCE AND WE DON'T REALIZE THAT THAT VIOLENCE IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE REFORMATION
POD0000000848_S0000113 THIS INCREDIBLY
POD0000000848_S0000137 IF YOU JUST SIMPLY GAVE A BIGOT
POD0000000848_S0000151 BUT BECAUSE AMERICANS SIMPLY GOT TO KNOW MORE JEWS AND CATHOLICS
POD0000000848_S0000171 THE ARGUMENT THAT I HEARD AS I WAS ADVISING THE NATIONAL TERRORISM ORGANIZATIONS VARIOUS CONGRESS PEOPLE
POD0000000848_S0000183 AND THEN
POD0000000848_S0000193 AN ANTI-THEIST BELIEVES RELIGION ITSELF IS AN INSIDIOUS
POD0000000848_S0000202 ONLY FIFTEEN PERCENT FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF ANTI-THEISM RIGHT AND SO WHAT I HEAR FROM A LOT OF ATHEISTS
POD0000000848_S0000226 THERE'S ENORMOUS DIVERSITY OF OPINION
POD0000000848_S0000249 AND YET THE VERY FACT THAT THEY HAVE CALLED IT THAT THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING THAT MUSLIMS
POD0000000848_S0000268 BUT I DO TRULY AND HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT CHANGE DRAMATIC CHANGE
POD0000000848_S0000282 I THINK SIX OR EVEN SEVEN OF THEM
POD0000000848_S0000302 BUT ALSO WHAT YOU POINT OUT AND AGAIN THAT JUST FEELS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME TO POINT OUT
POD0000000848_S0000312 BUT OF COURSE WE CAN'T IGNORE THEM
POD0000000848_S0000321 AND AGAIN I SAY THIS AS PART OF THAT MEDIA
POD0000000848_S0000331 AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THE VALUES THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS SHARE ARE IDENTICAL THAT THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME STRUGGLES THEY HAVE THE SAME HOPES AND THE SAME ASPIRATIONS
POD0000000848_S0000337 PEOPLE I THINK ARE AFRAID OF FUNDAMENTALISM
POD0000000848_S0000348 NO GOD BUT GOD THE ORIGINS EVOLUTION AND FUTURE OF ISLAM
POD0000000856_S0000015 HIS APPROACH TO ISLAM EVOLVED AFTER THE NINETEEN SEVENTY S
POD0000000856_S0000021 WHERE HE IS CURRENTLY BASED WITH THE FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION
POD0000000856_S0000029 AND THOUGH OF COURSE
POD0000000856_S0000040 AND I MEAN I'VE WORKED WITH CHILDREN ADULTS SUBSTANCE ABUSERS I DID MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY
POD0000000856_S0000055 AND OF COURSE
POD0000000856_S0000071 AND I THINK THAT WE CONTINUE TO GROW AND CONTINUE TO LEARN AS WE ARE NOW INVOLVED OF COURSE IN IRAQ AND IN AFGHANISTAN
POD0000000856_S0000081 MY GUEST ABDUL-RASHEED MUHAMMAD MINISTERS TO ALL SOLDIERS NOT JUST FELLOW MUSLIMS
POD0000000856_S0000103 MAJOR ABDUL-RASHEED MUHAMMAD
POD0000000856_S0000116 ALSO A REGULAR SERIES OF CHARITY OR CHARITABLE KINDS OF ACTIONS
POD0000000856_S0000121 MEAN
POD0000000856_S0000128 I MEAN WE'RE NOT HEARING A WHOLE LOT FROM THEM BUT WE SEEM TO HAVE THIS TENDENCY TO WANT TO ALMOST ASSOCIATE ISLAM WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE EXTREME IN THEIR VIEWS
POD0000000856_S0000144 U S ARMY MAJOR AND MUSLIM CHAPLAIN ABDUL-RASHEED MUHAMMAD
POD0000000856_S0000152 MUSLIM JURISTS HAVE RULED THAT WHAT A MUSLIM CANNOT CONTROL HE CANNOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR
POD0000000856_S0000160 MOREOVER EVEN IF FIGHTING CAUSES HIM DISCOMFORT SPIRITUALLY OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY
POD0000000856_S0000168 BELIEVE IT OR NOT
POD0000000856_S0000178 AND I THINK THAT MOST AMERICANS
POD0000000856_S0000186 HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF CONTEMPORARY MUSLIM-AMERICAN MUSIC BY THE GROUP NATIVE DEEN
POD0000000856_S0000209 SPEAKING OF FAITH COMES TO YOU FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA
POD0000000856_S0000229 HE SPOKE TO ME FROM FORT HOOD TEXAS WHERE HE IS CURRENTLY BASED WITH THE FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION
POD0000000856_S0000234 WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH IN A MILITARY COURT FOR KILLING SEVERAL OF HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS BY GRENADE IN IRAQ
POD0000000856_S0000243 I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY A HUGE QUESTION BUT
POD0000000856_S0000251 OR THE GROUP
POD0000000856_S0000266 SO EVEN BEFORE WE ARE TAUGHT RIGHT FROM WRONG FROM OUR MOTHERS OUR FATHERS OUR SCHOOL TEACHERS AND OTHERS
POD0000000856_S0000272 YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING
POD0000000856_S0000289 WELL NO IT WAS ACTUALLY-YEAH
POD0000000856_S0000295 AND IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A DREAM
POD0000000856_S0000305 I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I HAD ALSO TO WORK WITH JUST THE COMMON IRAQIS YOU KNOW
POD0000000856_S0000315 SO IT WAS SORT OF REPRESENTING BOTH WORLDS ALL AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000000856_S0000320 AND STILL UNFORTUNATELY MANY TIMES WHEN I RUN INTO OUR SOLDIERS WHO ARE NOT FROM MY UNIT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM
POD0000000856_S0000328 ALL DOING THE SAME THINGS FOR THE SAME PURPOSE
POD0000000856_S0000335 YOUR INTEREST IN ISLAM EARLY ON FROM THE STORY OF MALCOLM X AND IT WAS ALSO ON HAJJ THAT HE ALSO WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE SAID IS A REALLY CENTRAL PART OF ISLAMIC FAITH FOR YOU WHICH IS A SENSE OF THE ONENESS OF SHARED HUMANITY OH YES
POD0000000856_S0000349 I HAVE MET PEOPLE WHO IN AMERICA WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED WHITE
POD0000000856_S0000357 DURING THE PAST ELEVEN DAYS HERE IN THE MUSLIM WORLD
POD0000000856_S0000365 ALL PRAISE IS DUE TO ALLAH
POD0000000856_S0000372 TO INCLUDE FASTING YOU CAN ALSO FAST THERE OPTIONALLY IF YOU MISS CERTAIN THINGS OR IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONIES TO PAY FOR THE QURBANI
POD0000000856_S0000381 THERE IS WHAT IS CALLED ISLAMIC INSURGENCY IN IRAQ THAT IS THE SOURCE OF SO MUCH VIOLENCE RIGHT NOW
POD0000000856_S0000387 ONLY TO FIND SEVERAL YEARS LATER INDIVIDUALS WITH VARIOUS EXTREME VIEWS AND IDEAS TO THE EXTENT OF KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE FOR WHATEVER REASONS
POD0000000856_S0000398 AND MANY OF THEM ARE WILLING TO GO RIGHT BACK AND GIVE SOME MORE
POD0000000856_S0000410 YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO
POD0000000856_S0000415 I PROBABLY WASN'T CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS AS MOHAMMAD
POD0000000856_S0000427 SO
POD0000000856_S0000434 SUCH IMAGES STAND IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE MOST DISTURBING JUXTAPOSITIONS OF ISLAM AND THE U S MILITARY IN RECENT WEEKS
POD0000000856_S0000439 HE DID NOT WISH TO SPEAK WITH ME ABOUT SCANDALS OR ADDRESS SOME OF THE MORE DIFFICULT IMAGES COMING OUT NOW ABOUT ISLAM AND THE U S MILITARY
POD0000000856_S0000447 WE'D LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS SUBJECT AT SPEAKINGOFFAITH DOT ORG YOU'LL FIND A LINK TO WRITE TO US
POD0000000856_S0000460 AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA
POD0000000864_S0000007 THIS CITIZEN-LED MOVEMENT BREAKS THE NARRATIVE OF ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE
POD0000000864_S0000018 THEY WERE THERE TOGETHER ATTENDING A CONFERENCE ON GLOBAL MODELS OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE
POD0000000864_S0000028 YOU PARTICIPATED IN THE FIRST INTIFADA AND WERE ARRESTED TWICE I MEAN UM

POD0000000864_S0000052 YOU KNOW WITHOUT ANY REASON
POD0000000864_S0000060 BECAUSE HE WANTED TO COME WITH ME
POD0000000864_S0000070 AND HE USED TO TAKE CARE ESPECIALLY ABOUT ME
POD0000000864_S0000085 AND I LOST THAT
POD0000000864_S0000093 FOR ME LOSING YUSEF HOW MANY ISRAELIS SHALL I KILL TO FEEL BETTER
POD0000000864_S0000100 I'M NOT ALLOWED TO KILL SOMEBODY
POD0000000864_S0000114 WHEN THAT RELIGIOUS GUY YITZHAK FRANKENTHAL
POD0000000864_S0000121 I USED TO SEE SOLDIERS I USED TO SEE SETTLERS
POD0000000864_S0000128 I MEAN
POD0000000864_S0000136 IT'S QUITE A STRIKING IDEA USING THE PAIN IN THAT WAY YEAH
POD0000000864_S0000142 AND I DON'T WANT TO BE USED
POD0000000864_S0000150 AND TODAY I FEEL THAT
POD0000000864_S0000157 AND THE LIFE DOESN'T BECAME BETTER
POD0000000864_S0000169 AND I LEARN MORE AND MORE ABOUT YUSEF AS THE TIME GOES BY
POD0000000864_S0000175 I WASN'T INVOLVED SO MUCH WITH THE PHYSICAL WAY OF HOW HE DIED I DIDN'T WANT TO GO LIKE OTHER PARENTS
POD0000000864_S0000180 AND I REMEMBERED SILLY THINGS LIKE
POD0000000864_S0000188 I DON'T KNOW I'M TERRIBLE AT DATES NOT LONG BEFORE HE WAS KILLED
POD0000000864_S0000196 HE LIKED TO DRINK AND HAVE FUN AND DO ALL THE THINGS
POD0000000864_S0000209 SOME PARENTS JUST CHOOSE TO DIE WITH THEIR CHILDREN
POD0000000864_S0000223 YOU KNOW SURVIVE FINANCIALLY
POD0000000864_S0000231 IT'S THE SHARED PAIN THAT ALLOWS YOU TO OPEN TO ANOTHER PLACE COMPLETELY
POD0000000864_S0000237 AND SOMETIMES I SIT IN A CLASSROOM AND I FEEL HIM SORT OF AROUND ME
POD0000000864_S0000251 WE KEEP TALKING TO GROUPS WHO HAVE DIALOGUE
POD0000000864_S0000260 AND STILL BEING ABLE TO JOIN OUR GROUP AND BE PART OF THIS SEARCH FOR RECONCILIATION AND TO STOP THE VIOLENCE
POD0000000864_S0000267 THIS PROGRAM COMES TO YOU FROM APM
POD0000000864_S0000276 HAVE FAILED BECAUSE THEY'VE FOCUSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT CONTACTS
POD0000000864_S0000282 I WONDER WHEN I NOT ONLY WHEN I HEAR YOUR STORIES BUT WHEN I SEE HOW MUCH YOU TRAVEL YOU ARE OUT THERE PRESENTING ALL OVER THE PLACE
POD0000000864_S0000289 AND READING
POD0000000864_S0000298 BY THE DEEDS OF PEOPLE
POD0000000864_S0000306 I FEEL VERY MUCH
POD0000000864_S0000312 PEOPLE WHO WANT TO FLEE THEIR COUNTRY OR ETHIOPIANS
POD0000000864_S0000321 AND THIS WILL BE THEIR WAY OF PUSHING THE PEACE PROCESS FORWARD
POD0000000864_S0000329 THAT'S THE QUESTION OF UNDERSTANDING A CULTURE THAT'S NOT SOUTH AFRICA
POD0000000864_S0000341 I HAVE THIS EXAMPLE EVERY DAY
POD0000000864_S0000347 BUT THERE IS SOMETHING PUSHING YOU AFTER YOU KNOW THE OTHER SIDE
POD0000000864_S0000354 THERE IS TWO WAY YOU KNOW TO DEAL WITH THE PAIN
POD0000000864_S0000360 NOBODY WANT TO BE HONEST EVERYBODY WANT TO BE RIGHT
POD0000000864_S0000367 YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST
POD0000000864_S0000374 AS A PALESTINIAN
POD0000000864_S0000386 I DISCOVERED THE TWO OF THEM AS COMPELLING CHARACTERS IN A DOCUMENTARY FILM CALLED ENCOUNTER POINT

POD0000000864_S0000429 YOU'LL BE PRO THAT SIDE FOR THE DAY AND YOU'LL FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF AND THERE'LL JUST BE MORE BROKEN HEARTS AND NO WINNERS
POD0000000864_S0000436 BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF THIS THEATER
POD0000000864_S0000443 BUT I'LL HAVE TO TRAVEL OVERSEAS
POD0000000864_S0000451 AND YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY STRANGE BUT IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE TWO EVANGELISTICAL PEOPLE RUSHING AROUND THE WORLD TRYING TO CHANGE
POD0000000864_S0000463 ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE BEEN THERE TALKING AFTER THE SCREENING AFTER SHOWING THE FILM
POD0000000864_S0000474 NOT ALL OF THEM IS KILLING THE PALESTINIAN
POD0000000864_S0000484 IN QUR'AN YOU SHOULD FIGHT THE JEWISH AND TO KILL THEM THIS IS THE END
POD0000000864_S0000492 NOBODY CAN STOP IT
POD0000000864_S0000501 AS MUCH AS EVERYTHING THEY HAD TO SAY WAS THE DELIGHT THEY TOOK IN EACH OTHER AND THAT THEY BOTH SAID TO ME THAT WHEN THEY GREW UP YOU KNOW PUMLA SAID SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED THAT SHE WOULD HAVE A WHITE PERSON AS A FRIEND OR WANT A WHITE PERSON AS A FRIEND

POD0000000872_S0000114 AND
POD0000000872_S0000126 AND I FELT THAT I WAS ALIVE IN A WAY THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY BODY
POD0000000872_S0000135 WAS THAT JUST A FEELING YOU HAD ABOUT WHICH WORDS WERE MALE AND WHICH WORDS WERE FEMALE
POD0000000872_S0000151 AND THEREFORE IT WAS GENDERED FEMININE AND IT WASN'T ONLY AVOIDING COLOR I DIDN'T ACTUALLY PAY VERY MUCH ATTENTION TO WHAT I WAS WEARING
POD0000000872_S0000174 THE REAL ME

POD0000000872_S0000214 BUT WE DON'T THINK
POD0000000872_S0000222 THAT'S AN ACT OF RADICAL EVEN LIKE SOCIOPATHIC SELFISHNESS
POD0000000872_S0000238 MY GENDER AS A MAN WAS A PROMISE TO PEOPLE THAT THE WAY THAT I WAS ACTING WAS WHO I REALLY WAS
POD0000000872_S0000248 SO HOW COULD I HAVE DONE THAT WITH THEM IF I KNEW THAT I WASN'T BEING TRUE TO THEM
POD0000000872_S0000261 IT MATTERS TO GOD IT MATTERS IN THE ABSOLUTE SENSE SO WHETHER OR NOT YOU LIGHT SHABBAT CANDLES AT THE RIGHT TIME
POD0000000872_S0000278 THAT'S RIGHT PEOPLE WHO REALLY LIVE BY THAT ARE OFTEN NOT PEOPLE YOU WANT TO HANG OUT
POD0000000872_S0000287 YOU NEED TO SAY IF THEY'RE TREATING ME WITH BASIC RESPECT

POD0000000872_S0000342 THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE ABLE TO SEE MY HUMANNESS EVEN WITHOUT THE NORMAL
POD0000000872_S0000348 AND THAT FOR MOST OF US AFTER CHILDHOOD
POD0000000872_S0000358 AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY THE GLORY OF THE HUMAN RACE

POD0000000888_S0000215 STRATEGIES FOR GROWING UP IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EMAIL I'VE KNOWN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DECLARE EMAIL BANKRUPTCY
POD0000000888_S0000226 SHE STUDIES AND WRITES ABOUT THE SUBJECTIVE SIDE OF TECHNOLOGY THE INNER EFFECTS OF THE DIGITAL OBJECTS OF OUR LIVES
POD0000000888_S0000236 THEY MAY JUST BE THERE BEING IN A WAY THAT NEEDS ATTENTION
POD0000000888_S0000250 THESE ARE IMPORTANT MOMENTS IT'S SO INTERESTING THAT YOU'RE TALKING AS MUCH AS OR MORE ABOUT ADULTS NOT SETTING BOUNDARIES WITH THIS RIGHT I MEAN
POD0000000888_S0000266 I DON'T HAVE LIKE A CRAZY NOSTALGIA FOR
POD0000000888_S0000287 WAS YOU TALKED ABOUT RESEARCH AND THE STRESS THAT COMES WITH TECHNOLOGY
POD0000000888_S0000300 IS THAT WE
POD0000000888_S0000308 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS FOR YOU BUT IF I DON'T RESPOND TO AN EMAIL REALLY WITHIN A FEW HOURS

POD0000000888_S0000360 AND THEY SHOP
POD0000000888_S0000380 AND THEN SHE GOT THE IPHONE
POD0000000888_S0000397 WE'RE GOING TO FEEL WE DIDN'T DO OUR JOB
POD0000000888_S0000416 SHE'S FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR OF THE MIT INITIATIVE ON TECHNOLOGY AND SELF
POD0000000888_S0000423 WE'RE LEARNING MORE ALL THE TIME ABOUT OUR DIGITAL SPACES
POD0000000888_S0000430 FINALLY AFTER YEARS MAKING FUN OF TWITTER
POD0000000888_S0000440 SHE'S BECOME A WORLD-CHANGING AND LIFE-CHANGING VOICE WITH HER RESEARCH INTO HOW VULNERABILITY MAKES EVERYTHING POSSIBLE
POD0000000896_S0000023 THAT UNLIKE WHERE HE GREW UP IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
POD0000000896_S0000042 AND SO
POD0000000896_S0000077 QUITE AN INFLAMMATORY AND DIVISIVE MEDIA CULTURE
POD0000000896_S0000097 AND BELONGING
POD0000000896_S0000116 HOW DO WE IMPROVE THIS ARTICLE
POD0000000896_S0000149 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT AND THIS IS ON BEING
POD0000000896_S0000154 ONGOING LEARNING
POD0000000896_S0000169 AND THAT KIND OF OPENNESS THE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE ACTIONS BUT ALSO GIVING REAL CONTROL INTO THE COMMUNITY
POD0000000896_S0000186 I GET THIS THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE HERE AND THEY'RE HAVING DISCUSSIONS AND THAT'S HOW IT WORKS
POD0000000896_S0000205 I SAY A KIND GENEROUS
POD0000000896_S0000243 AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT MY VIEW OF TRUTH ACTUALLY DOESN'T MATTER
POD0000000896_S0000250 ABOUT WHICH CLEARLY THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO AGREE YEAH BUT YET THEY CAN BOTH AGREE TO SAY
POD0000000896_S0000257 LIKE THAT'S POSSIBLE AND IS EASIER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE EVER THOUGHT
POD0000000896_S0000288 MIGHT MISS THE POETRY OF THE UNIVERSE AND YET
POD0000000896_S0000307 AND IN SOME WAYS OF COURSE IT IS
POD0000000896_S0000329 EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE SOME FUN EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL WORK TO DO IN THEIR LIVES ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE THE SAME
POD0000000904_S0000007 A WAY OF BEING THAT GIVES YOU THE RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THE UPS AND THE DOWNS OF LIFE AND THAT ENCOMPASSES MANY EMOTIONAL STATES INCLUDING SADNESS
POD0000000904_S0000017 WHAT WE ARE WILL CHANGE I'M KRISTA TIPPETT AND THIS IS ON BEING
POD0000000904_S0000024 HE BEGAN HIS PROFESSIONAL LIFE AT THE CELLULAR GENETICS LABORATORY OF A NOBEL PRIZE-WINNING BIOLOGIST AT THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE IN PARIS
POD0000000904_S0000045 SO WHILE HE WAS DOING THE CIRCUMNAVIGATION HE WAS ALSO READING BOOKS ABOUT HINDUISM SUFISM
POD0000000904_S0000062 BUT THERE WAS A COMMON QUALITY THAT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH INNER STRENGTH
POD0000000904_S0000078 PAINTERS ORDINARY FOLKS
POD0000000904_S0000102 IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES HE'S JUST SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY GOOD HUMAN BEING
POD0000000904_S0000112 ASKED BY HIS FATHER AS THE DIALOGUE OPENS WHY HE LEFT HIS PROMISING SCIENTIFIC CAREER FOR A BUDDHIST PATH
POD0000000904_S0000121 YOU ABANDONED YOUR CAREER IN ORDER TO COMMIT YOURSELF COMPLETELY TO BUDDHIST PRACTICE AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE FELT
POD0000000904_S0000132 WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD OF PHENOMENA THE WORLD THAT WE SEE AS REAL ALL AROUND US
POD0000000904_S0000139 YOU CHANGE CLOTHES YOU MOVE FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER
POD0000000904_S0000146 FORTUNATELY
POD0000000904_S0000159 SO WHEN THEY SAW THAT SOME OF THEM GOT THE IDEA OF CREATING THAT MIND AND LIFE INSTITUTE FRANCISCO VARELA A GREAT NEUROSCIENTIST ADAM ENGLE
POD0000000904_S0000174 ALL THIS IS VERY NICE BUT WHAT CAN WE CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY
POD0000000904_S0000181 A CAPACITY KNOWN AS NEUROPLASTICITY
POD0000000904_S0000194 IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THERE'S A PHYSICAL CORRELATE
POD0000000904_S0000199 WELL YOU SEE FIRST OF ALL
POD0000000904_S0000210 WHAT ABOUT FOCUSED ATTENTION
POD0000000904_S0000223 WHAT WE BASICALLY CALL THE THIRD-PERSON APPROACH MEANS LOOKING FROM THE OUTSIDE
POD0000000904_S0000229 SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THEIR BRAIN
POD0000000904_S0000235 FEEL LOVE
POD0000000904_S0000241 THERE WAS NO SCIENCE WITHOUT EXPERIENCE
POD0000000904_S0000248 IT'S LIKE A TORCHLIGHT A LIGHT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE THINGS BUT LIGHT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL THING THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
POD0000000904_S0000265 BOTH ARE INTRIGUED BY CORRELATIONS THEY TRACE BETWEEN THE WAY QUANTUM PHYSICISTS DESCRIBE MATTER AND ENERGY AND THE WAY BUDDHISTS UNDERSTAND THE INTERDEPENDENCE AND IMPERMANENCE OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND ALL OF LIFE
POD0000000904_S0000277 AND INTERDEPENDENCE
POD0000000904_S0000286 LIKE TAKE A RAINBOW IN THE SKY WELL IT LOOKS VERY BEAUTIFUL
POD0000000904_S0000295 IF YOU GRASP TO SOMETHING AS BEING MINE
POD0000000904_S0000304 THAT'S ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF UNDERSTANDING INTERDEPENDENCE
POD0000000904_S0000311 IF IT WOULD WORK OK BUT THIS IS NOT WORKING WHY
POD0000000904_S0000326 TWO THREE TIMES OK
POD0000000904_S0000337 WITH INNER STRENGTH WITH INNER FREEDOM
POD0000000904_S0000345 SO WE HAVE TO DISTINGUISH MENTAL FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THAT WAY OF BEING THE CLUSTER OF QUALITIES LIKE ALTRUISTIC LOVE
POD0000000904_S0000351 SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN CULTIVATE
POD0000000904_S0000361 CONDITIONS FOR SURVIVAL
POD0000000904_S0000376 WHAT ARE THEY
POD0000000904_S0000383 SO THERE ARE WAYS TO COUNTERACT THOSE TO DISSOLVE THOSE
POD0000000904_S0000389 WE DON'T SIT FOR TWENTY MINUTES TO CULTIVATE COMPASSION IF WE WERE TO DO SO
POD0000000904_S0000394 WHAT IS GOOD TO LEARN CHESS WELL YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE AND ALL THAT IN THE SAME WAY
POD0000000904_S0000401 DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS SIXTY THREE YEARS OLD HE USED TO BE A RUNNER WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
POD0000000904_S0000406 HE HAD THE POTENTIAL
POD0000000904_S0000422 SO WE NEED A MINIMUM OF READINESS TO EFFICIENTLY AND WISELY BE AT THE SERVICE OF OTHERS SO COMPASSION NEEDS ALSO TO BE ENLIGHTENED BY WISDOM OTHERWISE IT'S BLIND
POD0000000904_S0000429 THAT PEOPLE MAY IN FACT HUMAN BEINGS MAY IN FACT BE LEARNING SOMETHING
POD0000000904_S0000444 NAIVE IMAGE
POD0000000904_S0000456 IS ALSO A VERY ROBUST SENSE OF HUMOR
POD0000000904_S0000490 SO SAME SITUATION
POD0000000904_S0000500 HELPING TO BUILD THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION FOR A LOVING WORLD
POD0000000912_S0000017 HE HAD AN EARLY SUCCESSFUL CAREER AS A JOURNALIST WITH TIME MAGAZINE IN NEW YORK CITY
POD0000000912_S0000024 I WAS REALLY
POD0000000912_S0000038 AND WHEN OCCASIONALLY A MISSIONARY WILL PAY A VISIT TO HER HOUSE AND SAY EXCUSE ME MA'AM HAVE YOU EVER READ THE BIBLE
POD0000000912_S0000064 THIS IS THE FIRST GENERATION WHERE HUMAN BEINGS DON'T INHERIT THEIR RELIGIOUS IDENTITY THEIR SPIRITUAL IDENTITY WHERE MODERN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY CRAFTING THESE THINGS ON THEIR OWN
POD0000000912_S0000079 AND I THINK SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WITH A MAN OF THAT DEGREE OF SPIRITUAL SERIOUSNESS AND DEVOTION HAS TAUGHT ME WHAT A SERIOUS
POD0000000912_S0000091 I MAKE A FIVE-FOOT COMMUTE TO MY DESK
POD0000000912_S0000112 IT WAS AS IF A HUGE HEAVINESS FELL AWAY FROM ME
POD0000000912_S0000132 BUT TO BRING THAT CALM INTO THE MOTION
POD0000000912_S0000150 AND RELIGION IS THE CUP
POD0000000912_S0000160 RELIGION IS LIKE TEA IT'S A GREAT LUXURY IT INCREASES THE SAVOR OF LIFE
POD0000000912_S0000206 HE'S NOW BASED IN A MODEST QUIET NEARLY TECHNOLOGY-FREE HOME IN JAPAN
POD0000000912_S0000221 NOW I THINK LUXURY HAS TO DO WITH HAVING A LOT OF TIME
POD0000000912_S0000240 YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT
POD0000000912_S0000257 AND THAT AS WE AGE
POD0000000912_S0000274 READ A THIRTEENTH CENTURY ZEN DISCOURSE PICK UP ST JOHN OF THE CROSS AND LISTEN TO THE LATEST LEONARD COHEN ALBUM
POD0000000912_S0000290 SO IF RUMI AND JOHN OF THE CROSS AND MEISTER ECKHART AND DOGEN THE GREAT ZEN TEACHER WERE TO TALK TOGETHER EACH MIGHT TALK IN THE LANGUAGE AND IN THE FRAMEWORK OF HIS PARTICULAR TRADITION
POD0000000912_S0000336 HELPING TO BUILD THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION FOR A LOVING WORLD
POD0000000920_S0000012 MY GOD
POD0000000920_S0000027 AND SUDDENLY
POD0000000920_S0000039 WHERE YOU CAN FACE LIFE WITHOUT THE INTERFERENCE OF THE MIND STILL BEING ABLE TO USE THE MIND WHEN IT'S NEEDED
POD0000000928_S0000006 BUT AFTER DEREK'S IDEOLOGY WAS OUTED IN HIS FIRST YEAR AT NEW COLLEGE IN FLORIDA
POD0000000928_S0000015 WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS FRIDAY NIGHT
POD0000000928_S0000026 ALONG WITH MOSHE TO INVITE DEREK TO COME
POD0000000928_S0000044 WOULD YOU EVEN SAY THAT THAT'S A WAY YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON TO YOURSELF OR WITHIN THE COMMUNITY
POD0000000928_S0000050 OUR MOTIVATION WAS MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON EACH OTHER OTHER PEOPLE WITHIN THE MOVEMENT ITSELF AND GOING TO EVENTS AND SEEING EACH OTHER AND REINFORCING THAT YOU BELIEVE THIS AND I BELIEVE THIS
POD0000000928_S0000073 SO THERE WAS THIS DISCERNMENT
POD0000000928_S0000081 REAL AWARENESS THAT HIS VIEWS ON WHITE NATIONALISM HAD CHANGED
POD0000000928_S0000095 THE ONE THAT'S OSTENSIBLY VICTIMIZED BY THE IDEOLOGY
POD0000000928_S0000122 WHO OF COURSE HAD TO LEAVE GERMANY A JEW
POD0000000928_S0000133 AS I MENTIONED I WAS AFRAID THAT IF I WERE TO ASK THAT THE DEFENSES WOULD GO UP
POD0000000928_S0000146 SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT YOU NEVER MADE THE SHABBAT DINNERS NEVER BECAME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHITE NATIONALISM
POD0000000928_S0000157 A COUPLE YEARS LATER CAME OUT THE OTHER END
POD0000000928_S0000168 BUT MY BELIEF SYSTEM SAYS THAT THEY SHOULD ALL BE REMOVED FROM THE UNITED STATES
POD0000000928_S0000184 DEREK BLACK GREW UP THE HEIR APPARENT OF A LEADING WHITE NATIONALIST FAMILY
POD0000000928_S0000189 I SPOKE WITH DEREK AND MATTHEW AT THE INVITATION OF THE UNITED STATES HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON D C
POD0000000928_S0000197 THE CONTEXT FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS WAS THAT AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THAT I HAD GOTTEN TO KNOW FOR A SEMESTER BEFORE THEY KNEW WHO I WAS AND WHO I RESPECTED
POD0000000928_S0000210 TO THE WHITE NATIONALIST IDEOLOGY AND OTHER HATEFUL IDEOLOGIES
POD0000000928_S0000216 WHERE DOES IT END
POD0000000928_S0000224 IS THAT YOU HAD TAKEN YOURSELF OUT OF THAT US WHICH YOU SAID WAS AT THE CENTER
POD0000000928_S0000237 AND EVEN IN THAT ENVIRONMENT
POD0000000928_S0000251 ARE THERE THINGS YOU LEARNED THAT YOU CARRY WITH YOU THROUGH THE WORLD THAT YOU FIND
POD0000000928_S0000265 THEY'RE NEVER IN TOO DEEP
POD0000000928_S0000279 AND LOOKING AT THAT DYNAMIC HAPPEN
POD0000000928_S0000288 NO PRESSURE
POD0000000928_S0000303 WE WRING OUR HANDS A LOT ABOUT THE DIGITAL SPACE
POD0000000928_S0000310 WHEN IT'S FACE-TO-FACE IT'S A DIFFERENT BALLGAME I THINK IT'S MUCH HARDER
POD0000000928_S0000317 HAS SHAPED YOU AND TRANSFORMED YOU
POD0000000928_S0000326 BUT THE TERRIBLE COST OF THAT IS THAT YOU RUN A VERY REAL RISK OF LOSING EMPATHY FOR PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH YOU
POD0000000928_S0000334 DEREK WHAT MAKES YOU DESPAIR
POD0000000928_S0000346 AND NOW I THINK I'M BACK TO BEING CONFIDENT
POD0000000928_S0000356 THANK YOU SO MUCH DEREK AND MATTHEW FOR MODELING THAT
POD0000000928_S0000369 WORKING TO CREATE A FUTURE WHERE UNIVERSAL SPIRITUAL VALUES FORM THE FOUNDATION OF HOW WE CARE FOR OUR COMMON HOME HUMANITY UNITED
POD0000000936_S0000010 THE LEARNING CURVES WE'RE ON
POD0000000936_S0000024 AND YOU'VE SAID YOU'RE ALMOST KIND OF OBSESSED ABOUT THIS
POD0000000936_S0000051 THIS NEW SPHERE
POD0000000936_S0000060 WE REPORT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY
POD0000000936_S0000074 AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS WHICH IS
POD0000000936_S0000088 EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE DISCIPLINES HAS A PROFESSIONAL SOCIETY THAT SETS STANDARDS
POD0000000936_S0000105 BUT STILL I THINK THERE'S A HUGE RECKONING BUT ANYWAY SHE WROTE
POD0000000936_S0000113 THAT'S FAIR
POD0000000936_S0000136 AND SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT THERE WAS A CHOICE TO PUT SOMETHING FALSE ON THEIR HOMEPAGE WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO DECRY ALL THE FALSITY
POD0000000936_S0000155 IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHEN THEY'RE MAKING GOOD CHOICES AND JUST CHOICES
POD0000000936_S0000174 EVEN THOUGH FACEBOOK'S A PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY AND ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED IN ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE DAYS
POD0000000936_S0000180 YOU'VE WRITTEN A LOT ALSO ABOUT
POD0000000936_S0000212 REALLY HOW YOU WERE INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE ONLINE AND HOW OFTEN YOU CONGRATULATED SOMEBODY OR THANKED SOMEBODY
POD0000000936_S0000230 SOMETIMES THEY HADN'T SPOKEN THEM FOR A REASON
POD0000000936_S0000266 FROM CULTURE FROM ART
POD0000000936_S0000274 TODAY I'M WITH THE TECHNOLOGIST ANIL DASH
POD0000000936_S0000279 YOU'VE ASKED PUBLICLY
POD0000000936_S0000291 IF I HAVE A KID SOMEDAY WHAT WOULD THEY SEE
POD0000000936_S0000311 SO MY CHILDREN ARE RIGHT NOW EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY TWO
POD0000000936_S0000335 AND I THINK ABOUT THAT WITH SO MANY EXPERIENCES WHERE
POD0000000936_S0000347 IT CAN BE AMPLIFIED BY THE IMMEDIACY AND THE FACT THAT IT HAPPENS IN YOUR HOME
POD0000000936_S0000374 USING AN ALGORITHM THAT'S OPAQUE TO YOU
POD0000000936_S0000388 AND I'M LIKE I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE FAILURES I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE COMPANIES THAT SUCCEED
POD0000000936_S0000397 AT LEAST THE ONES I READ
POD0000000936_S0000426 JUDY PRICE AT THE ASPEN INSTITUTE WYE FELLOWS
POD0000000944_S0000010 HE'S FASCINATED BY WHAT WE MIGHT LEARN FROM THE AMISH AND HOW THEY COLLECTIVELY DISCERN WHICH TECHNOLOGIES TO USE OR NOT AND WHY
POD0000000944_S0000021 WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT THE WORD TECHNOLOGY APPEARED IN THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
POD0000000944_S0000028 OR CERTAINLY DID NOT TALK ABOUT VERY MUCH
POD0000000944_S0000041 AND THAT MIND MAY BE AN ANIMAL MIND SO IN THE BROADEST SENSE WHEN A
POD0000000944_S0000055 AND THAT BEHAVIOR IS AN EXTENSION OF THE LIFE FORCE THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS THAT HAS PRODUCED LIFE
POD0000000944_S0000075 IT WAS ORIGINALLY SEEN AS
POD0000000944_S0000093 AND I DO TWEET SO YEAH
POD0000000944_S0000117 WELL
POD0000000944_S0000136 WHO DO THINGS WITHOUT MUCH TECHNOLOGY
POD0000000944_S0000150 ONE IS
POD0000000944_S0000165 AND SO THE BISHOP WILL SAY OK IVAN
POD0000000944_S0000189 WHICH MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO TREAT CUSTOMERS MORE LIKE CITIZENS
POD0000000944_S0000195 IT'S CRAZY TO BEAT ON THE CEO FOR NOT DOING A BETTER JOB BECAUSE NOBODY HAS EVER DONE THIS BEFORE
POD0000000944_S0000209 AND WHAT MAY TAKE SEVERAL GENERATIONS TO SUPPLY
POD0000000944_S0000224 YOU CAN LISTEN AGAIN AND SHARE THIS CONVERSATION WITH KEVIN KELLY THROUGH OUR WEBSITE

POD0000000968_S0000176 NO ONE TOLD ME THAT IN ADDITION TO TERRIFYING YOU IT WAS ALSO GONNA BE THIS WORK OF ART
POD0000000968_S0000198 HER INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH HER DAUGHTER

POD0000001000_S0000328 AND THAT IS THE
POD0000001000_S0000344 WE COME INTO LIFE THROUGH ANXIETY
POD0000001000_S0000368 A DIRECTION YES
POD0000001000_S0000402 WE CANNOT GRASP IT BUT WE CAN UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GRASPING AND UNDERSTANDING
POD0000001000_S0000425 WHEN I AM CONFRONTED WITH SOMETHING
POD0000001000_S0000440 SOME ANSWER EMERGES
POD0000001000_S0000457 A LISTENING HEART
POD0000001008_S0000012 WE RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF RESPONSES FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WERE ESPECIALLY STRUCK BY THE VIVID STORIES ABOUT RAMADAN ITSELF THAT NEARLY EVERYONE HAD TO TELL ACROSS A REMARKABLE SPECTRUM OF LIFE AND SPIRITUAL SENSIBILITY WE BEGIN WITH SAMAR JARRAH
POD0000001008_S0000023 AND I WAKE UP VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING

POD0000001008_S0000043 AND I SAY I CAN'T I'M FASTING
POD0000001008_S0000065 SO EVEN IF YOU CAN'T EAT THE DATE
POD0000001008_S0000072 AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THE VIEWPOINT OF MANY IN AMERICA WHO SEE THE VIOLENCE AND ARROGANCE ESPOUSED BY REACTIONARIES
POD0000001008_S0000087 AND I'M WEARING THESE TWO WHITE SHAWLS
POD0000001008_S0000105 YANINA VASCHENKO LIVES IN DALLAS
POD0000001008_S0000112 AND THAT WAS THE MOST PEACEFUL I HAD EVER FELT
POD0000001008_S0000123 BUT THERE'S ALWAYS THAT EMPHASIS ON FINDING OUT THE BEST WAY TO DO SOMETHING
POD0000001008_S0000141 SHE GREW UP ROMAN CATHOLIC AND MARRIED AN ARAB-MUSLIM MAN
POD0000001008_S0000150 AND THE YEAR WE GOT MARRIED RAMADAN AND LENT FELL AROUND THE SAME TIME
POD0000001008_S0000161 A FELLOW IRAQI-MUSLIM
POD0000001008_S0000183 I HAPPENED TO BE IN SIXTH GRADE
POD0000001008_S0000207 SO I GAVE AWAY THE BURGERS
POD0000001008_S0000227 HOW IT INSTILLS HUMILITY
POD0000001008_S0000243 RAMADAN IN DUNKIN' DONUTS WHICH ADNAN WROTE AND READ FOR US
POD0000001008_S0000254 HE FIRST SUBMITTED MORNING PRAYER
POD0000001008_S0000263 WE'RE EXPLORING THE DELIGHTS AND THE GRAVITY OF RAMADAN
POD0000001008_S0000269 THEY RANGE IN AGE FROM THEIR TEENS TO THEIR SEVENTY S
POD0000001008_S0000278 YOU CAN'T GO WITHOUT DRINKING WATER
POD0000001008_S0000290 I COULD CONCENTRATE MORE
POD0000001008_S0000303 WE HAVE TO HONOR AND RESPECT THEM UNRESERVEDLY AND TREAT THEM WITH UTTER KINDNESS
POD0000001008_S0000312 I TOLD MY FATHER I WAS LIKE
POD0000001008_S0000329 I WAS BORN
POD0000001008_S0000339 IT ALLOWED ME A GREATER FREEDOM IN MY UNDERSTANDING OF MY GOD
POD0000001008_S0000355 IT'S HER FAMILY'S RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY THAT ILLUSTRATES A QUINTESSENTIAL ASPECT OF BEING MUSLIM IN THE UNITED STATES MY GRANDFATHER
POD0000001008_S0000386 AND HE BROKE THE FAST WITH US ALMOST EVERY TIME I VISITED THE STORE WITH MY DAD WE WOULD JUST SIT AROUND
POD0000001008_S0000400 OUT OF COLLEGE SHE WORKED AS A PHOTOGRAPHER COVERING CELEBRITIES AND NIGHTLIFE
POD0000001008_S0000415 NOW RETIRED AND LIVING IN DALLAS SHE VOLUNTEERS WITH THE TEXAS MUSLIM WOMEN'S FOUNDATION
POD0000001008_S0000441 THE WHOLE OF THE QUR'AN DIVIDED INTO THIRTY PARTS IS READ IN MUSLIM CONGREGATIONS AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE MONTH OF RAMADAN
POD0000001008_S0000461 HUMANKIND IS AT A LOSS
POD0000001016_S0000007 LIKE TWO BOOKENDS
POD0000001016_S0000026 BUT SOMETIMES YORKSHIRE IS SO GROUNDED IT'S SURREAL AND IT COMES OUT IT TURNS INTO ITS OPPOSITE
POD0000001016_S0000052 THAT WHATEVER YOU DESIRE OF THE WORLD WILL NOT COME TO PASS EXACTLY AS YOU WILL LIKE IT BUT THE OTHER MERCY IS THAT WHATEVER THE WORLD DESIRES OF YOU WILL ALSO NOT COME TO PASS AND WHAT ACTUALLY OCCURS IS THIS MEETING THIS FRONTIER
POD0000001016_S0000067 THE PLACE WHERE YOU'VE BEEN BUILDING YOUR PERSONALITY AND WHERE YOU THINK YOU'VE BEEN BUILDING WHO YOU ARE
POD0000001016_S0000083 AS IF LIFE WERE A PROGRESSIVE AND CUNNING CRIME WITH NO WITNESS TO THE TINY HIDDEN TRANSGRESSIONS
POD0000001016_S0000088 YOU MUST NOTE THE WAY THE SOAP DISH ENABLES YOU
POD0000001016_S0000093 AND THE TINY SPEAKER IN THE PHONE IS YOUR DREAM-LADDER TO DIVINITY
POD0000001016_S0000099 EVERYTHING
POD0000001016_S0000127 I KNOW PEOPLE RECOGNIZE IT BUT IT'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT FRIGHTENING
POD0000001016_S0000169 AND THEN I GREW UP IN AN AREA OF WEST YORKSHIRE WHICH WAS RAVING SOCIALIST AND WHERE THE LUDDITES USED TO MARCH ACROSS THE FIELDS TO BREAK UP THE MACHINERY SO
POD0000001016_S0000191 INNOCENCE IS WHAT WE ALLOW TO BE GIFTED BACK TO US ONCE WE'VE GIVEN OURSELVES AWAY
POD0000001016_S0000209 FOLLOW OR SUBSCRIBE TO GET THIS AND OTHER EXTRAS IN YOUR FEED AS SOON AS WE RELEASE THEM
POD0000001016_S0000222 BUT YOU HAVE TO SAY IT ALSO WITH THE INTIMACY OF CARE AND OF UNDERSTANDING AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000001016_S0000239 EXCEPT IN AN ORGANIZATIONAL SETTING IT HAS TREMENDOUS CONSEQUENCES ON OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES WE'VE ALL WORKED IN ORGANIZATIONS WHERE SOMEONE IS SITTING THERE AT A CROSSROADS OR NEXUS IN THE ORGANIZATION
POD0000001016_S0000251 VULNERABILITY IS THE UNDERLYING EVER PRESENT AND ABIDING UNDERCURRENT OF OUR NATURAL STATE
POD0000001016_S0000256 TO HAVE A TEMPORARY ISOLATED SENSE OF POWER OVER ALL EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES IS A LOVELY ILLUSIONARY PRIVILEGE AND PERHAPS THE PRIME AND MOST BEAUTIFULLY CONSTRUCTED CONCEIT OF BEING HUMAN AND ESPECIALLY OF BEING YOUTHFULLY HUMAN
POD0000001016_S0000261 HOW WE INHABIT OUR VULNERABILITY
POD0000001016_S0000266 AS MISERS AND COMPLAINERS
POD0000001016_S0000271 NEVER WALKING FULLY THROUGH THE DOOR
POD0000001016_S0000283 THERE IS NO HOUSE LIKE THE HOUSE OF BELONGING
POD0000001016_S0000293 THE DARK WILL MAKE A HOME FOR YOU TONIGHT
POD0000001016_S0000306 AND THAT YOU LEARN MORE OF EACH TIME YOU ALLOW IT TO TAKE A DIFFERENT FORM
POD0000001016_S0000315 GENIUS
POD0000001016_S0000335 IT'S THE INNATE GIFT THAT MAKES ME WANT TO PRACTICE THE VIOLIN ACTUALLY IT'S
POD0000001016_S0000355 YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ACTUALLY SHAPING A DIFFERENT LIFE MEETING DIFFERENT PEOPLE
POD0000001016_S0000369 ANIMATING QUESTION WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE HUMAN
POD0000001016_S0000387 YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A PARENT
POD0000001016_S0000397 WOULD YOU MAYBE ALSO JUST READ ONE MORE READ WORKING TOGETHER
POD0000001016_S0000405 AND FIND THE TRUE SHAPE OF OUR OWN SELF
POD0000001016_S0000415 OUR LOVELY THEME MUSIC IS PROVIDED AND COMPOSED BY ZOE KEATING
POD0000001024_S0000014 JOHN O'DONOHUE'S FINAL WORK WAS TO BLESS THE SPACE BETWEEN US PUBLISHED POSTHUMOUSLY
POD0000001024_S0000029 IT WAS WAITING LIKE A HUGE WILD INVITATION TO EXTEND YOUR IMAGINATION
POD0000001024_S0000036 WHICH IS USED TO GET TO A DESTINATION
POD0000001024_S0000051 JUST CAME AWAY DOWN TO SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND SPENT THE WEEK BY THE SLOW OCEAN AND SHE'S TOTALLY RECOVERED
POD0000001024_S0000065 AND HE HAS THIS STATEMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS BOOK THE NATURE AND DESTINY OF MAN
POD0000001024_S0000074 IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE TO THINK THAT WE CAN MAKE ANY SOUNDS THAT CAN REACH OVER ACROSS TO EACH OTHER AT ALL
POD0000001024_S0000094 SO I BELIEVE THAT DEEP IN THE HEART OF EACH OF US
POD0000001024_S0000108 POSSIBILITY IS THE SECRET HEART OF TIME
POD0000001024_S0000131 BUT AS ACTUALLY THE PARENT OR MOTHER OF PRESENCE
POD0000001024_S0000142 CROSSING OVER WHICH WE NEED TO BECOME DIFFERENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO BE DIFFERENT
POD0000001024_S0000165 WHERE THERE IS STILL A SURENESS IN YOU
POD0000001024_S0000183 SO I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO STEP BACK A LITTLE FROM ONE'S LIFE AND SEE AROUND ONE
POD0000001024_S0000202 OR A PEDAGOGY OF INTERIORITY THAT'S WHY I FIND THE AESTHETIC THINGS LIKE POETRY FICTION
POD0000001024_S0000214 IT WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE I CRIED
POD0000001024_S0000231 AND THE UNUSUAL EMOTIONAL POWER OF CELTIC MUSIC
POD0000001024_S0000243 IT RETURNS US OFTEN IN FLEETING BUT SUSTAINING MOMENTS HE SAID
POD0000001024_S0000248 YEAH I THINK IT'S NOT JUST RELEVANT LIKE BUT I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY NECESSARY
POD0000001024_S0000261 AND THIS IS WHERE I DIVERGE A LITTLE FROM THE BUDDHIST TRADITION EVEN THOUGH I LOVE BUDDHISM AS A METHODOLOGY TO CLEAN UP THE MIND AND GET YOU INTO PURITY OF PRESENCE
POD0000001024_S0000272 THEN YOUR WHOLE HEART WAKENS UP
POD0000001024_S0000283 FIFTY THINGS TO DO
POD0000001024_S0000298 A GREATER SENSE OF GRACE AND ELEGANCE
POD0000001024_S0000310 I ALSO THINK OF THOSE UNKNOWN PEOPLE WHO ARE THE REAL HEROES FOR ME WHO YOU NEVER HEAR ABOUT
POD0000001024_S0000322 BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS I'M ALWAYS AMAZED ABOUT IRISH MUSIC FOR INSTANCE
POD0000001024_S0000338 AND BECAUSE WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME AT WORK

POD0000001032_S0000074 IT'S EMBARRASSING BUT IT'S TRUE
POD0000001032_S0000086 WHICH IS THAT WHEN A BUDDHIST AND A CHRISTIAN HAVE A REALLY DEEP CONVERSATION
POD0000001032_S0000109 AND OUTSIDE IT A WALLED GARDEN WITH A CHAIR AND BEYOND THAT JUST THIS GREAT BLUE EXPANSE OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN
POD0000001032_S0000125 HERMITAGE THAT YOU GO TO NOW THAT YOU SPEND TIME AT EVERY YEAR

POD0000001032_S0000238 AND I'M STILL LEARNING IT
POD0000001032_S0000252 WITH AGE
POD0000001032_S0000268 NOT JUST ANOTHER KIND OF AGENDA OR SOMEBODY TRYING TO SELL SOMETHING
POD0000001032_S0000287 WHICH WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO NAME
POD0000001032_S0000333 SUPPORTING ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND CIVIL DIALOGUE ON THE DEEPEST AND MOST PERPLEXING QUESTIONS FACING HUMANKIND WHO ARE WE WHY ARE WE HERE AND WHERE ARE WE GOING
POD0000001040_S0000004 AND I'M STRANGELY COMFORTED BY HIS INSISTENCE THAT WE OURSELVES HUMAN BEINGS
POD0000001040_S0000014 MARTIN REES HOLDS THE HONORARY TITLE OF ASTRONOMER ROYAL
POD0000001040_S0000021 MARTIN REES IS ATHEIST
POD0000001040_S0000045 AND WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT AT ALL IN FACT AH
POD0000001040_S0000058 LIKEWISE
POD0000001040_S0000074 BUT IF THOSE MILLIMETERS ARE MEASURED IN A FOURTH SPATIAL DIMENSION AND WE'RE IMPRISONED IN OUR THREE WE WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT
POD0000001040_S0000083 AND ALSO
POD0000001040_S0000103 AND THE UNIVERSE MAY GO ON FOREVER
POD0000001040_S0000119 BUT THEN WE'RE ALL LIVING IN THIS MOMENT WHERE
POD0000001040_S0000128 THEY'D HAVE DETECTED AH
POD0000001040_S0000147 BUT ALSO OPENS UP THE QUESTION OF WHETHER ON ANY OF THESE OTHER PLANETS LIFE GOT STARTED
POD0000001040_S0000172 UM
POD0000001040_S0000196 WELL I MEAN I I MENTIONED TWO WHO I WAS PRIVILEGED TO KNOW
POD0000001040_S0000211 EVEN THOUGH THEY WON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED
POD0000001040_S0000229 COSMOLOGIST ASTROPHYSICIST AND RECENT PAST PRESIDENT OF GREAT BRITAIN'S SCIENTIFIC ROYAL SOCIETY
POD0000001040_S0000244 WE HAVE A LOT OF LISTENERS WHO ARE ATHEISTS AND AGNOSTIC
POD0000001040_S0000270 EVEN AS YOU SAY THIS COMPLEX SYSTEM OF LIFE
POD0000001040_S0000294 UNDERSTAND NATURE IN INCREASINGLY GENERAL WAYS
POD0000001040_S0000331 ALSO THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE IN THE AREAS I WORK IN IS CRUCIALLY DEPENDANT ON
POD0000001040_S0000342 SO WE CAN ACTUALLY STUDY THESE QUITE QUICKLY AND THEN WE LOOK IN THE SKY AND SEE IF THE OUTPUT OF OUR CALCULATION RESEMBLES WHAT WE ACTUALLY SEE
POD0000001040_S0000359 SO THAT WHAT WE'VE CALLED THE UNIVERSAL LAWS ARE REALLY JUST BYLAWS
POD0000001040_S0000397 HE'S THE AUTHOR OF SEVERAL BOOKS INCLUDING OUR COSMIC HABITAT
POD0000001040_S0000411 YES
POD0000001040_S0000420 GENETICIST AND ANGLICAN PRIEST LINDON EAVES
POD0000001048_S0000008 THE APPARENT OMNIPRESENCE AND OMNIPOTENT POWERS OF MATHEMATICS
POD0000001048_S0000019 SO LET'S LET'S TALK FIRST OF ALL ALL ABOUT JUST THE
POD0000001048_S0000029 AND THAT LAW ALREADY BY THE NINETEEN FIFTY S
POD0000001048_S0000039 AND YET
POD0000001048_S0000057 BUT WHAT I THINK HAPPENS IS THAT MATHEMATICS IS A VERY VERY COMPLEX MIXTURE OF INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES
POD0000001048_S0000078 ONE MYSTERY IS THAT SOMEHOW
POD0000001048_S0000088 TODAY WITH THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE'S MARIO LIVIO
POD0000001048_S0000100 WHICH MEANS YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO
POD0000001048_S0000115 SYMMETRY BASICALLY IS A QUANTITY THAT DESCRIBES SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT CHANGE
POD0000001048_S0000126 ALSO IN YOUR LIFE ARE A LOVER OF ART
POD0000001048_S0000156 KNOW NOT TO MENTION ART IN THE SAME BREATH
POD0000001048_S0000166 SCIENCE HAS NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT A GOD LIKE THIS
POD0000001048_S0000180 I NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT GOD WAS THINKING
POD0000001048_S0000199 THERE YOU'LL ALSO FIND MY CONVERSATION WE MENTIONED WITH THE JESUIT ASTRONOMERS GUY CONSOLMAGNO AND GEORGE COYNE
POD0000001048_S0000220 AND SO DO WE RIGHT BUT WE DON'T USE THE SAME PHYSICS
POD0000001048_S0000240 THOSE TWO PHENOMENA SIDE BY SIDE
POD0000001048_S0000271 THESE ARE INHERENTLY VERY COMPLEX
POD0000001048_S0000307 SO THAT'S ONE THING WE'RE TRYING TO BASICALLY FIND MORE OF THE PROPERTIES OF THIS DARK ENERGY
POD0000001048_S0000332 AND NOW YOU KNOW WE KNOW IT'S THE DOMINANT FORM OF ENERGY OF OUR UNIVERSE
POD0000001048_S0000350 YOU KNOW

POD0000001056_S0000004 OUR BRAINS ARE NOT PRIMARILY LOGICAL BUT ANALOGICAL
POD0000001056_S0000014 THE HUMAN-SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGIES ADVANCED RESEARCH INSTITUTE
POD0000001056_S0000019 YEAH I WAS BORN IN HULL
POD0000001056_S0000036 JUST WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO OR JUST WHEN I STARTED AT HIGH SCHOOL
POD0000001056_S0000051 IT ALL FIT BECAUSE IT ALL CAME TOGETHER IN MY MIND
POD0000001056_S0000064 YOU REALIZE THAT THAT ETHEREAL WORLD ITSELF HAS BEEN CREATED BY GENERATIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS AND SO MATHEMATICS EXISTS AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL AND A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT
POD0000001056_S0000093 AND YOU HAD TO DO IT IN YOUR HEAD OR WITH AN ABACUS BOARD OR SOMETHING SO FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
POD0000001056_S0000164 AND THE ONLY ANSWER TO THAT I CAN COME UP WITH IS THAT DEEP IN OUR PSYCHES
POD0000001056_S0000175 THERE WE ALSO HAVE LINKS TO MORE OF HIS FAVORITE EQUATIONS SET TO MUSIC WITH THE CHORAL GROUP ZAMBRA
POD0000001056_S0000184 WE'RE CATCHING SOME OF HIS DELIGHT IN MATHEMATICAL THINKING AS SOMETHING THAT REFLECTS THE INNER WORLD OF THE HUMAN MIND AND CAN HELP US NAVIGATE THE OUTER WORLD IN UNEXPECTED WAYS
POD0000001056_S0000210 BUT OUR LIVES BECAME IRREVOCABLY CHANGED AND BOUND UP WITH NUMBERS THE MOMENT WE INVENTED NUMBERS AND MONEY ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND YEARS AGO
POD0000001056_S0000233 ON THE OTHER HAND
POD0000001056_S0000254 IT'S ABOUT ME TALKING TO ONE STUDENT
POD0000001056_S0000269 LOOKING AT THAT STUDENT BECAUSE IT WAS ALL ABOUT ESTABLISHING HUMAN CONNECTION AND GETTING THEM TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH ME AS THEIR FRIEND AND INSTRUCTOR
POD0000001056_S0000295 MATHEMATICS CAN CERTAINLY PLAY A ROLE
POD0000001056_S0000313 THOSE ARE GONE
POD0000001056_S0000325 WITHOUT THE GORGEOUS TRAPPINGS OF PAINTING OR MUSIC
POD0000001056_S0000339 IN SOME SENSE
POD0000001056_S0000360 TO THE FACT THAT YES THERE'LL BE GOOD TEACHERS AND BAD TEACHERS AND BETTER TEACHERS AND WORSE TEACHERS
POD0000001056_S0000372 I SHARE MY THOUGHTS AT KRISTA TIPPETT

POD0000001064_S0000054 HIS FATHER WAS JAMAICAN HIS MOTHER'S BRITISH
POD0000001064_S0000059 I DIDN'T SEE PEOPLE WHO LOOKED LIKE YOU
POD0000001064_S0000075 AND DEAF IS BEING READ IN THIS CONTEXT AS BEING NEGATIVE
POD0000001064_S0000086 I THINK THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN EXPERIENCE ABOUT BEING BELIEVED
POD0000001064_S0000099 YOU KNOW HOW LOUD THESE THINGS ARE ON MY WAIST
POD0000001064_S0000104 WHY DIDN'T I SEE ANYONE THAT LOOKED LIKE YOU WHEN I WAS IN ENGLAND

POD0000001072_S0000006 OPEN UP WITH ALL THE FULLNESS OF ITS BEING TO US
POD0000001072_S0000012 I THINK OF THEM LYING EMPTY AT NIGHT
POD0000001072_S0000021 ALL THOSE YEARS AGO PENCILS FASTENING A COAT CLASP PUTTING UP YOUR HANDS
POD0000001072_S0000028 THE THINGS THAT LOVERS KNOW ABOUT THEIR NIGHTTIME HABITS OR THEIR MIDDLE-OF-THE-NIGHT HABITS OR WHERE IT IS YOUR HANDS GO WHEN YOU'RE ASLEEP
POD0000001072_S0000040 IT FEELS TO ME THAT THE FACT THAT THE LAST WORD IN THE POEM IS US
POD0000001072_S0000050 AND THE CLOSEST POINT THAT THIS POEM GETS TO THE QUESTION OF SONG IS THAT LOVELY LOVELY VERB TOWARDS THE END
POD0000001072_S0000061 HOW IT CAN FEEL LIKE THAT SOMETIMES THINGS STRETCH ON FOR A LONG TIME OR OTHER TIMES THEY END QUICKLY THAT WE ARE IN BURSTS OF EXPERIENCE WITH EACH OTHER
POD0000001072_S0000071 OR BURIED IN THE CAVE OF YOUR EAR ALL THE THINGS THEY DID CAUTIOUSLY
POD0000001072_S0000076 BEFORE TOUCH PUSHING OFF THE LEDGE OF THE EASY QUIET DANCING BETWEEN US
POD0000001072_S0000089 WHICH IS LOCATED ON DAKOTA LAND
POD0000001080_S0000007 BUT PADRAIG AND CORRYMEELA EXTEND A QUIET GENERATIVE FORCE FAR BEYOND THEIR NORTHERN COAST
POD0000001080_S0000012 AGREEMENT HAS RARELY BEEN THE MANDATE FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE EACH OTHER
POD0000001080_S0000024 AT ANY GIVEN TIME THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD SPENDING WEEKS OR MONTHS HERE AS VOLUNTEERS
POD0000001080_S0000029 WE'VE LEARNED FAR MORE FROM HIM THAN HE HAS FROM US
POD0000001080_S0000056 AND REALIZING THAT SOME PLACES THAT I WENT
POD0000001080_S0000069 SO HERE IS ACTUALLY A COMPLICATED COMPROMISE ALSO TO BE ABLE TO SAY
POD0000001080_S0000075 AND YOU MUST TREAT IT AS A POWERFUL STRANGER
POD0000001080_S0000088 I THINK ALSO AROUND THIS SUBJECT OF THE TROUBLES
POD0000001080_S0000118 SOMETHING HAPPENS AND SUDDENLY WITH NO PREPARATION YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING THAT YOU DIDN'T WISH TO HAPPEN
POD0000001080_S0000132 ARE ACTUALLY DOING WHAT SEEMS REASONABLE TO THEM
POD0000001080_S0000143 LOVING
POD0000001080_S0000153 TO UNDERSTAND MIGHT ACTUALLY HELP US TO HEAL
POD0000001080_S0000187 TOTALLY
POD0000001080_S0000201 AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THE REALITY IS THAT WHETHER WE CHANGE OR WHETHER WE STAY THE SAME THESE QUESTIONS WILL REMAIN
POD0000001080_S0000207 YOU WAKE
POD0000001080_S0000214 WHEN I WAS A CHILD I LEARNED TO COUNT TO FIVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
POD0000001080_S0000221 BECAUSE EACH TIME IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THAT LIFE HAS BEEN TAKEN
POD0000001080_S0000232 HE'S ALSO A POET A THEOLOGIAN AND THE LEADER OF A COMMUNITY THAT HELPED BRING PEACE TO NORTHERN IRELAND AFTER GENERATIONS OF VIOLENT SOCIAL FRACTURE
POD0000001080_S0000240 AND ACTUALLY THIS WISDOM THIS PLACE HAS
POD0000001080_S0000250 READING YOU AND READING ABOUT THE WORK YOU'VE DONE AROUND THIS AND ALSO JUST HOW YOU'VE INHABITED THIS PART OF YOUR IDENTITY IN THE WORK YOU DO
POD0000001080_S0000268 AND HE SAID THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING REALLY POOR SENTENCES AND HE GOES
POD0000001080_S0000282 WHERE I THEN GIVE INSULT BACK I HAVE NEVER HAD A SITUATION WHERE THAT'S BEEN FRUITFUL
POD0000001080_S0000293 DO YOU SEE THIS WOMAN
POD0000001080_S0000304 HOW MANY TIMES HAVE MY WORDS BRUISED YOU
POD0000001080_S0000325 I WANT ALSO TO BE CONVERTED
POD0000001080_S0000337 THE SOCIETY THE RELIGION THE POLITICS THE PAIN ARE ALL HELD WITHIN THOSE STORIES THEY DON'T EXIST IN ABSTRACT WAY
POD0000001080_S0000370 AM I ALLOWED TO BE GAY AND CHRISTIAN FOR INSTANCE WAS THE QUESTION THAT PLAGUED ME FOR YEARS
POD0000001080_S0000386 I'M GOING TO MEET JESUS AS CURATED AND NARRATED BY ELEVEN YEAR OLDS FROM WEST BELFAST

POD0000001080_S0000435 AND GIVING COMMITTED GUARANTEES TO THE OTHER'S SAFETY
POD0000001080_S0000456 I'M GOING TO SKIP OVER ALL OF MY OTHER BRILLIANT QUESTIONS
POD0000001080_S0000467 I KNOW THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SIT ANYWAY
POD0000001080_S0000472 I SAY HELLO TO MY CHAOS

POD0000001096_S0000313 IT'S YOU BECOMING MORE AND MORE REAL AND MORE AND MORE VISIBLE IN THE WORLD

POD0000001096_S0000353 YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP ASKING
POD0000001096_S0000367 I WANT TO ASK YOU BEFORE WE HEAR SOME MORE POETRY
POD0000001096_S0000385 ALL THE WAYS YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION
POD0000001096_S0000393 THEY ACTUALLY START TO TAKE ON A KIND OF SEASONALITY
POD0000001096_S0000403 I AM THINKING OF THE WAY THE INVISIBLE AIR TRAVELED AT SPEED ROUND A SHAPED WING EASILY HOLDS OUR WEIGHT I AM THINKING OF THE WAY THE INVISIBLE AIR TRAVELED AT SPEED ROUND A SHAPED WING EASILY HOLDS OUR WEIGHT
POD0000001096_S0000412 AND THE BELL AND THE BLACKBIRD
POD0000001104_S0000005 AND SHE TEACHES HOW THIS WAY OF BEING AND WRITING IS POSSIBLE
POD0000001104_S0000011 IS CARRIED AROUND IN THE POCKETS AND MEMORIES OF READERS AROUND THE WORLD BEFORE YOU KNOW KINDNESS AS THE DEEPEST THING INSIDE
POD0000001104_S0000016 ONLY KINDNESS THAT TIES YOUR SHOES AND SENDS YOU OUT INTO THE DAY TO GAZE AT BREAD
POD0000001104_S0000024 I ALWAYS START MY INTERVIEWS BY INQUIRING ABOUT THE RELIGIOUS OR SPIRITUAL BACKGROUND OF SOMEONE'S CHILDHOOD AND I JUST WONDER WHERE YOU'D START REFLECTING ON WHAT THAT WAS IN YOUR LIFE
POD0000001104_S0000031 AND THEY HAD ACCEPTED THAT MY MOTHER'S FAMILY
POD0000001104_S0000042 BUT ONE YOUNG MAN ASKED ME HOW WERE YOU BRAVE ENOUGH TO DO THAT WHAT GAVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE
POD0000001104_S0000055 THAT I WAS LIVING IN A POEM THAT MY LIFE WAS THE POEM AND IN FACT
POD0000001104_S0000065 FOR EXAMPLE
POD0000001104_S0000072 YOU JUST HOLD IT
POD0000001104_S0000092 NEITHER OF HIS TWO LANGUAGES CAN REACH IT
POD0000001104_S0000099 WHAT DOES THAT DO TO OTHERS SO YES I AM HORRIFIED BY THE EASE WITH WHICH PEOPLE MAY BELITTLE ONE ANOTHER THESE DAYS AS IF THAT WERE A REASONABLE THING TO DO
POD0000001104_S0000114 IN JUNIOR HIGH YOU LEARNED THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY HAVE TWO FRIENDS THAT ARE NOT EXACTLY ALIKE
POD0000001104_S0000129 AND I THINK ALL THE HOLY PERSONS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS AND FAITHS HAVE ALWAYS CALLED UPON US TO EMPATHIZE IN A MORE PROFOUND WAY
POD0000001104_S0000136 I ACTUALLY KEPT THAT POSTCARD THAT SAID WAR IS OVER IN THAT SAME FONT ON MY WALL FOR YEARS BECAUSE I SO MUCH WANTED TO BELIEVE IT
POD0000001104_S0000150 PLEASE DESCRIBE HOW YOU BECAME A WRITER POSSIBLY I BEGAN WRITING AS A REFUGE FROM OUR INSULTING FIRST-GRADE TEXTBOOK
POD0000001104_S0000155 WHY WEREN'T THEY LOOKING TO BEGIN WITH
POD0000001104_S0000168 AND I THINK THAT SORT OF APPETITE FOR KNOWING
POD0000001104_S0000176 FEATHER LOST FROM THE TAIL OF A BIRD
POD0000001104_S0000181 SLEPT BY ITSELF
POD0000001104_S0000186 GLEAMING DOME OF THE MOSQUE AND THE HUNDRED CORRIDORS OF CINNAMON AND ROPE
POD0000001104_S0000191 LOVE MEANS YOU BREATHE IN TWO COUNTRIES
POD0000001104_S0000206 I REALLY FEEL AMONGST ALL MY POEMS
POD0000001104_S0000213 IT WAS QUITE A SHAKE-UP OF AN EXPERIENCE AND WHAT DO YOU DO NOW WE DIDN'T HAVE PASSPORTS WE DIDN'T HAVE MONEY WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
POD0000001104_S0000224 I WAS GOING TO STAY HERE AND HE WAS GONNA GO THERE AND AS I SAT THERE ALONE
POD0000001104_S0000231 BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT KINDNESS REALLY IS YOU MUST LOSE THINGS
POD0000001104_S0000236 HOW YOU RIDE AND RIDE THINKING THE BUS WILL NEVER STOP
POD0000001104_S0000241 HOW HE TOO WAS SOMEONE WHO JOURNEYED THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH PLANS AND THE SIMPLE BREATH THAT KEPT HIM ALIVE
POD0000001104_S0000246 THEN IT IS ONLY KINDNESS THAT MAKES SENSE ANYMORE
POD0000001104_S0000255 AND VERY RARELY DO YOU HEAR ANYONE SAY THEY WRITE THINGS DOWN AND FEEL WORSE
POD0000001104_S0000280 IF YOU WRITE THREE LINES DOWN IN A NOTEBOOK EVERY DAY AND THEN IN PARENTHESES THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE GREAT OR IMPORTANT THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER
POD0000001104_S0000294 AND HE SAID NO LISTENING IS PARTICIPATION IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
POD0000001104_S0000306 DO YOU HAVE ANNOUNCEMENTS YES EVERY MORNING
POD0000001104_S0000313 THAT IT WOULD BE OK FOR HIM TO READ A POEM
POD0000001104_S0000324 NOT ALWAYS
POD0000001104_S0000330 IS HOLY IN THE MIDDLE
POD0000001104_S0000341 SO WIDE OPEN
POD0000001104_S0000349 ESPECIALLY IF I'D BEEN IN SOME KIND OF MISCHIEF AT SCHOOL WHICH OCCASIONALLY HAPPENED BECAUSE I WASN'T ALWAYS FOCUSED ON JACK AND
POD0000001104_S0000369 AND THIS YOUNG WOMAN IN KUWAIT THIS MORNING ON THE SKYPE CLASS I DID SHE WAS SAYING THAT SHE WAS PALESTINIAN HAD NEVER BEEN TO PALESTINE
POD0000001104_S0000382 BUT I DO THINK WRITING WOULD REALLY HELP IN HER CASE
POD0000001104_S0000403 SO WRITING IS A WAY THAT WE'RE CONTINUALLY CONTINUOUSLY RESTORED TO THAT
POD0000001104_S0000412 YOU CAN LISTEN AGAIN READ AND DOWNLOAD ALL THE POEMS NAOMI SHIHAB NYE RECITED THIS HOUR

POD0000001112_S0000021 HE CREATED AN ORIGINAL MODEL OF PRISON MINISTRY STILL VERY ACTIVE TODAY PRISON FELLOWSHIP
POD0000001112_S0000029 HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE NOTION YOU HELD AND THE NOTION THAT OUR CULTURE HELD ABOUT THE ROLE OF CHRISTIANS IN POLITICS
POD0000001112_S0000041 IN YOUR EARLY POLITICAL CAREER YOU WERE NOT A RELIGIOUS PERSON BY ANY DEFINITION THE WAY YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN NOW
POD0000001112_S0000052 CHRISTIANS HAD BEEN IN THE FUNDAMENTALIST HINTERLANDS THROUGH MOST OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THEY'D STAYED OUT OF THE POLITICAL LIMELIGHT
POD0000001112_S0000060 GOING TO SEMINARY
POD0000001112_S0000080 I WAS GETTING AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF PRESSURE AS I THINK MOST PASTORS OF LARGE CHURCHES WERE
POD0000001112_S0000098 IF THE CHURCH WERE AWAKE WHEN ABORTION PASSED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY S IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED BUT THE CHURCH WAS ASLEEP
POD0000001112_S0000108 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
POD0000001112_S0000126 IS NOT A NEW ISSUE IT HAS BEEN BATTLED THROUGH THE CENTURIES AND THE CHURCH HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE VANGUARD OF THAT YOU KNOW
POD0000001112_S0000143 THE QUESTION IS
POD0000001112_S0000158 THEN FOR ME TO GO INTO A VOTING BOOTH AND VOTE AGAINST WHAT IS THE CENTRAL TRUTH IN MY LIFE THAT IS MY COMMITMENT TO CHRIST IS IMPOSSIBLE
POD0000001112_S0000167 I WON'T VOTE FOR PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THAT
POD0000001112_S0000183 AGAIN
POD0000001112_S0000192 SHANE CLAIBORNE HAS ACHIEVED A FOLLOWING AMONG MANY YOUNG EVANGELICALS FOR HIS SOCIAL ACTIVISM AND HIS WRITING
POD0000001112_S0000198 I THINK I WANT TO THROW OUT A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER
POD0000001112_S0000207 AND HE WOULD BE THE LAST ONE TO SAY WE DON'T ENGAGE IN POLITICS HE WOULD SAY WE BUILD THE KINGDOM
POD0000001112_S0000219 AFTER THE CHURCH ACQUIRED POLITICAL POWER WHERE HE AUTHORIZED THE STATE TO START PERSECUTING HERETICS
POD0000001112_S0000236 WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE INSTANT COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN POWER AND THE MASSES
POD0000001112_S0000260 YOU CAN LOVE THE LORD
POD0000001112_S0000276 SHANE CLAIBORNE
POD0000001112_S0000286 THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IN CREATION
POD0000001112_S0000294 NOT THAT HE'S JUDGING THEM AS INFERIOR BUT SIMPLY THAT THEY VIOLATE THE MORAL ORDER
POD0000001112_S0000315 AND THAT BREAKS MY HEART
POD0000001112_S0000333 EMBRACED ME
POD0000001112_S0000338 WE NEVER PROBABLY VOTED FOR THE SAME CANDIDATE
POD0000001112_S0000348 BUT CERTAIN ISSUES DEMAND THAT WE GET INVOLVED NOW THERE IS A RESPECTABLE MENNONITE TRADITION YODER AND OTHERS ARE PART OF IT WHICH SAY WE JUST WILL STAND BACK CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE COMMUNITY
POD0000001112_S0000359 EACH OF YOU AS ONE
POD0000001112_S0000375 AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WHAT LOOKS LIKE JESUS AND THAT'S WHAT BRINGS PEOPLE INTO THE KINGDOM AND THAT'S WHAT'S EVENTUALLY GOING TO TRANSFORM THE WHOLE WORLD BE LIKE JESUS MY ONE MESSAGE WOULD BE AGREEMENT WITH BOTH OF THOSE CONFESSION
POD0000001112_S0000382 WHY WE BELIEVE THEM AND HOW TO PRESENT THEM WINSOMELY IN A WORLD THAT IS SO POLARIZED AND DIVIDED AND ALIENATED
POD0000001112_S0000390 THIS IS WHERE IT ALL STARTED
POD0000001112_S0000403 HE'S THE AUTHOR OF THE MYTH OF A CHRISTIAN NATION LETTERS FROM A SKEPTIC
POD0000001120_S0000004 AND FOR THREE YEARS RUNNING ITS PIVOTAL TEXT BY ITS LEADING FIGURE WALTER RAUSCHENBUSCH

POD0000001120_S0000022 HE ALSO SPENT NINE YEARS AS CHAPLAIN AND ASSOCIATE DEAN OF RELIGIOUS LIFE AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY
POD0000001120_S0000028 HE ONLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF RELIGIOUSLY IN HIS EARLY YEARS BY BEING THE FIRST PERSON TO FLUNK OUT OF PRESBYTERIAN CONFIRMATION
POD0000001120_S0000066 HE ALSO SAID THAT ABOUT CHRISTIANS
POD0000001120_S0000074 THY WILL BE DONE ON EARTH
POD0000001120_S0000093 WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE POVERTY I SEE AROUND ME AND THEY BECOME VERY ACTIVE SO WHAT I'M REALLY ACTUALLY THRILLED ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS THIS KIND OF
POD0000001120_S0000129 I HADN'T REALIZED UNTIL NOW THAT THE PHRASE WHAT WOULD JESUS DO
POD0000001120_S0000134 SO WE CALLED UP A THEOLOGIAN JOHN D CAPUTO
POD0000001120_S0000146 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT TODAY ON BEING OCCUPYING THE GOSPEL

POD0000001120_S0000343 WE ALL DO IS KIND OF SAYING OK YEAH THAT'S JUST THAT
POD0000001120_S0000354 BUT THE SAME IS TRUE OF OUR PERSONAL EFFORTS TO LIVE A CHRISTIAN LIFE IT IS TRUE ALSO OF EVERY LOCAL CHURCH

POD0000001128_S0000061 I GOT VERY INTERESTED IN SOMETHING I CALL THE DEEP STORY
POD0000001128_S0000076 I CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF A DEEP STORY AS A WAY OF GETTING TO EMOTION
POD0000001128_S0000097 THE IDEA IS
POD0000001128_S0000103 TURNS AROUND
POD0000001128_S0000113 ANOTHER ONE SAID NO YOU HAVE IT WRONG
POD0000001128_S0000135 BUT YOU KNOW
POD0000001128_S0000150 LIKE CANDY

POD0000001128_S0000213 THE ONLY THING IS
POD0000001128_S0000230 I THOUGHT THAT WAS SO INTERESTING
POD0000001128_S0000249 THE OTHER SIDE

POD0000001128_S0000288 YOU FOUND SPECIFIC ISSUES ON WHICH THERE WAS POTENTIAL FOR COALITION SAFEGUARDING CHILDREN ON THE INTERNET REDUCING PRISON POPULATIONS FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS PROTECTING AGAINST COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE HUMAN GENOME PUSHING FOR GOOD JOBS REBUILDING OUR RAIL SYSTEM ROADS AND BRIDGES AND OUR SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE
POD0000001128_S0000313 AND THAT IS BURIED TO SOME DEGREE
POD0000001128_S0000338 YES
POD0000001128_S0000354 IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ALL CAPABLE OF
POD0000001128_S0000407 OUR FUNDING PARTNERS INCLUDE THE JOHN TEMPLETON FOUNDATION
POD0000001136_S0000010 HOW MIGHT THE INTERNET OF THE FUTURE LOOK UTTERLY DIFFERENT FROM THE INTERNET OF NOW
POD0000001136_S0000018 WRITING ARTICLES FOR A VARIETY OF PUBLICATIONS FROM HARPERS THE NATION
POD0000001136_S0000023 THE IMMANENT FRAME KEEPS ME IN TOUCH WITH THE ACADEMY
POD0000001136_S0000034 YOU ARE THIS NEW PHENOMENON OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
POD0000001136_S0000043 THAT THIS IS NOT NEW TO OUR TIME
POD0000001136_S0000056 OFTEN IN MANY CASES IN RELATION TO THAT WORD
POD0000001136_S0000076 AND OFTEN NOT BEING RELIGIOUSLY AFFILIATED BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THE TRADITIONS LIVING UP TO WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF
POD0000001136_S0000089 ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE I'VE FOUND OUTSIDE OF THESE SPACES OF THESE CHURCHES WERE INTENSELY INTERESTED IN THESE QUESTIONS
POD0000001136_S0000102 WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY SAYING WAS
POD0000001136_S0000113 AND THEY HAPPENED TO BE HAD THE FIRST WEBSITE UP
POD0000001136_S0000122 TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD DRAW FROM THE IDEAS OF THOSE TRADITIONS THEY STARTED TALKING ABOUT JUBILEE
POD0000001136_S0000131 HE CAME TO BELIEVE THAT THE ESSENTIAL TRUTHS AND THE ESSENTIAL IMPULSES OF CHRISTIANITY WOULD SURVIVE EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION
POD0000001136_S0000144 MY FEELING ABOUT IT AND WE CAN'T KNOW WHAT BONHOEFFER THOUGHT BUT I THINK THAT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE NECESSARY
POD0000001136_S0000158 INSTITUTIONS WILL ALWAYS FAIL US
POD0000001136_S0000176 ENDED UP BEING ABOUT RACE AND ABOUT CLASS
POD0000001136_S0000193 NOW CERTAINLY WE HAVE A VERY SHORT SENSE OF TIME IN THIS CULTURE SO IT LOOKS NOW LIKE OCCUPY FAILED AND WENT AWAY RIGHT I THINK THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT
POD0000001136_S0000218 A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE WERE WORKING WITH THE STORY THAT WAS TOLD
POD0000001136_S0000230 BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE TOLD THAT STORY IT SET UP A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE FOR A KIND OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND THEN IT SET UP A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE TO SAY WHERE'S YOUR MARTIN LUTHER KING COMING FROM THE SKY TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO
POD0000001136_S0000239 HE'S THE AUTHOR OF TWO BOOKS GOD IN PROOF THE STORY OF A SEARCH FROM THE ANCIENTS TO THE INTERNET AND THANK YOU ANARCHY NOTES FROM THE OCCUPY APOCALYPSE
POD0000001136_S0000245 AND WE MAY NEVER CATCH UP AND WE ARE TRYING TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE
POD0000001136_S0000256 I THINK IN MANY CASES CONSUMING
POD0000001136_S0000274 BUT IT DOESN'T WORK
POD0000001136_S0000286 AS A KIND OF BASIS FOR BUILDING SUSTAINABLE SUSTAINING COMMUNITIES
POD0000001136_S0000300 IT SEES THE LIGHT OF DAY IT MEETS ITS OWN HISTORY
POD0000001136_S0000321 I DO WANT TO SAY IN TERMS OF THE REDEMPTIVE QUALITIES OF TECHNOLOGY YOUR FIANCE IS HERE TODAY
POD0000001136_S0000332 ITS GOALS
POD0000001136_S0000338 WHAT IS OUR ONE DEMAND
POD0000001136_S0000350 IT SOUNDS VERY ORDINARY BUT I THINK IT'S VERY POWERFUL
POD0000001136_S0000360 FOR INSTANCE
POD0000001136_S0000379 MORE JUST
POD0000001136_S0000385 PERHAPS THOSE OF US WHO CONTINUE TO FANCY OURSELVES CONCERNED READERS
POD0000001136_S0000391 HE WHO KISSES THE JOY AS IT FLIES LIVES IN ETERNITY'S SUNRISE
POD0000001136_S0000400 I ASKED HIM WHAT
POD0000001136_S0000421 AND FOR ME
POD0000001136_S0000429 WHEN WE MEET EACH OTHER FACE-TO-FACE AND EVEN
POD0000001136_S0000437 HE IS THE AUTHOR OF TWO BOOKS GOD IN PROOF THE STORY OF A SEARCH FROM THE ANCIENTS TO THE INTERNET AND THANK YOU ANARCHY NOTES FROM THE OCCUPY APOCALYPSE
POD0000001144_S0000007 HE IS A POET AND A THEOLOGIAN AND HAS BEEN A SOCIAL HEALER AT CORRYMEELA IN NORTHERN IRELAND WHICH HE CALLS A SOFT PLACE FOR HARD CONVERSATIONS
POD0000001144_S0000013 LET US LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF OUR OWN VOICES
POD0000001144_S0000020 MAGNIFICENT
POD0000001144_S0000029 AND YOU'VE SAID THAT YOUR EARLY ETHICAL TRAINING CAME FROM READING YOUR FATHER'S OLD COLLEGE POETRY BOOKS
POD0000001144_S0000040 MOTIVATING YOU NOURISHING YOU
POD0000001144_S0000047 THERE IS A HOPE A FIERCE HOPE THAT SUSTAINED PEOPLE IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING
POD0000001144_S0000064 AND WHAT THAT TEACHES ME IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO LISTEN TO THE INTUITION
POD0000001144_S0000079 WE CAN DISCOVER SOME KIND OF HOPE THE HOPE OF PROTEST THE HOPE OF TRUTH-TELLING
POD0000001144_S0000087 YOU SAID THAT THERE'S AN IRISH PHRASE VALUING STORY WHAT IS THAT
POD0000001144_S0000106 THAT'S WHAT WE ARE THAT'S ALL WE ARE
POD0000001144_S0000114 WHICH IS GOING BACK AND TELLING THE STORY THEY HAVEN'T TOLD
POD0000001144_S0000124 TWO MEMBERS WHO HAVE SEATS IN THE FRONT PEWS
POD0000001144_S0000139 AND
POD0000001144_S0000147 BUT IT ALSO I THINK WAS A WAY FOR THEM TO APPRECIATE WHERE THEY CAME FROM AND WHERE THEY ARE NOW
POD0000001144_S0000167 IN IRISH WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WHY BOTHER USING ONE WORD WHEN YOU CAN USE TEN
POD0000001144_S0000186 FOR WHAT CAN'T BE SAID
POD0000001144_S0000199 AND I THINK
POD0000001144_S0000210 THEY DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW A PARTICULAR PENTAMETER OR ANY KIND OF RHYTHM BUT THEY FOLLOW A PROGRESS
POD0000001144_S0000217 THAT REVEALS SOMETHING BACK TO ME RATHER THAN JUST A LIST OF DEMANDS
POD0000001144_S0000232 WELL THEN WE MIGHT FIND A WAY WITHIN WHICH GOD IS LISTENING BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE CREATING IN THE ROOM AND THAT GOES BEYOND HOW YOU ARTICULATE A DEVOTION
POD0000001144_S0000248 SHUT UP AND LET ME LOVE YOU

POD0000001152_S0000120 THE RELATIONSHIP IS NOT VERIFIABLE
POD0000001152_S0000131 THOUGH I HAD PUBLISHED A BOOK OF POEMS WITH A MAJOR UNIVERSITY PRESS AND HAD POEMS IN SEVERAL MAJOR PRESS ANTHOLOGIES OF YOUNGER AMERICAN POETS I HAD TO FIGHT FOR MY LIFE BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUES CONSIDERED POETRY INFERIOR TO LITERARY CRITICISM
POD0000001152_S0000137 BUT I KEPT THINKING OF MY GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHERS
POD0000001152_S0000145 LEAD US BACK TO SILENCE
POD0000001152_S0000152 POETRY OPENS US TO THIS OTHERNESS THAT EXISTS WITHIN US
POD0000001152_S0000161 AND YET THE PRESENCE OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE PACE OF OUR LIVES MAKES SILENCE THIS ENDANGERED THING THAT WE DO HAVE TO INTENTIONALLY CREATE IT
POD0000001152_S0000179 AND AFTER THE READING THEY ASKED ME IF I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TEACHING THERE
POD0000001152_S0000189 TURN OFF THE LIGHTS
POD0000001152_S0000201 GROUNDED CONTEMPLATIVE PLACE
POD0000001152_S0000219 AND IN A WAY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS YOU GO
POD0000001152_S0000236 NELSON'S POEM AND MY DUSTY OFFICE REMINDS ME THAT THE UNPOLISHED AND ORDINARY IS CLOAKED IN THE EXTRAORDINARY
POD0000001152_S0000241 CRUMBS OF THE INFINITE LIE SCATTERED ACROSS MY DESK
POD0000001152_S0000257 I'M WITH THE STORYTELLING POET MARILYN NELSON
POD0000001152_S0000267 HE SAYS THAT MEDITATION
POD0000001152_S0000274 JUST FEELING GRATEFUL AND ONE OF THEM IS A PRAYER I FOUND IN A BOOK BY A A NUN WHO LIVES AS A HERMIT
POD0000001152_S0000287 I GUESS IT'S FROM AUDEN
POD0000001152_S0000294 I'M REALLY INTRIGUED BY THAT PHRASE AN ALLIANCE MENTALITY WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
POD0000001152_S0000301 I WONDER IF YOU'D READ A COUPLE OF POEMS
POD0000001152_S0000310 HE LIVED WHAT HE BELIEVED HE LIVED HIS FAITH
POD0000001152_S0000318 AND NEW YORK AND THEN HE PURCHASED HIS OWN FREEDOM
POD0000001152_S0000326 I'D BEEN CHEATED AND BEATEN
POD0000001152_S0000331 MY TOBACCO IS STRUTTING
POD0000001152_S0000336 I WISH I COULD REMEMBER THOSE PRAISE-SONGS WE USED TO DANCE TO
POD0000001152_S0000341 THEN GRAZE AGAIN
POD0000001152_S0000346 MY EFFIGIES TO SCARE RACCOONS AND CROWS FROWN FIERCELY
POD0000001152_S0000352 I AM FREE AND CLEAR NOT ONE PENNY DO I OWE

POD0000001152_S0000363 THIS FAMILY
POD0000001152_S0000370 THEY WERE THERE
POD0000001152_S0000381 I WONDER
POD0000001152_S0000394 AND MEN SITTING BEHIND THEM AND THEN BOYS AND SERVANTS AND SLAVES SITTING IN THE BACK THAT'S HOW IT BEGAN
POD0000001152_S0000402 THIS COMMUNITY NOW HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
POD0000001152_S0000415 TRYING TO
POD0000001152_S0000423 BUT WHAT I THINK THE STORIES YOU'RE INVESTIGATING AND TELLING ARE ALSO TRUE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE CAPABLE OF
POD0000001152_S0000436 I VISUALIZE THIS WOMAN
POD0000001152_S0000441 BUT OFFICER
POD0000001152_S0000459 OH IF ONLY I COULD SHUT IT UP
POD0000001152_S0000464 WHAT INSTRUMENT IS THIS
POD0000001152_S0000481 HELPING TO BUILD THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION FOR A LOVING WORLD
POD0000001160_S0000023 BY THOMAS MERTON
POD0000001160_S0000041 WHY DO WE WASTE OUR TIME DOING THINGS WHICH IF WE ONLY STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT THEM
POD0000001160_S0000069 PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL SPIRITUAL
POD0000001160_S0000093 IN YOUR WORK
POD0000001160_S0000116 VISUAL CHRISTIAN FORM OF MIDRASH RIGHT
POD0000001160_S0000137 AND HE SAID WELL GOOD THEN YOU'LL BE WORKING IN A HOSPITAL
POD0000001160_S0000159 THAT'S VERY IGNATIAN
POD0000001160_S0000172 TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU TO HAVE A JESUIT NOW ON THE THRONE OF ST PETER
POD0000001160_S0000182 DO YOU THINK HE READ YOUR BOOK
POD0000001160_S0000214 THERE'S GOOD NEWS
POD0000001160_S0000246 TO FIND GOD IN ALL THINGS
POD0000001160_S0000257 JOY IS HAPPINESS IN GOD
POD0000001160_S0000271 NOT AT ALL
POD0000001160_S0000310 OUR RELATIONSHIP GETS VERY COLD AND DISTANT
POD0000001160_S0000324 THERE'S NO RIGHT WAY TO PRAY OR A WRONG WAY TO PRAY THAT'S ANOTHER GREAT INSIGHT OF IGNATIAN SPIRITUALITY
POD0000001160_S0000345 AS YOU SAY KIND OF DISPELS THESE NOTIONS THAT
POD0000001160_S0000373 ON THE MARGINS AND POPE FRANCIS SAID THAT TO US
POD0000001160_S0000395 AND
POD0000001160_S0000417 I SAW CHRIS ROCK RECENTLY ON SATURDAY NIGHT
POD0000001160_S0000431 SO
POD0000001160_S0000449 AND THE FRANCISCAN SAYS SURE I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT WHAT'S YOUR INTENTION AND HE SAYS I WANT A LEXUS
POD0000001160_S0000468 OUR FUNDING PARTNERS ARE THE FORD FOUNDATION
POD0000001168_S0000007 AND HIS GRATEFULNESS IS NOT AN EASY GRATITUDE OR THANKSGIVING BUT A FULL-BLOODED REALITY-BASED PRACTICE AND CHOICE
POD0000001168_S0000024 MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID
POD0000001168_S0000042 YES
POD0000001168_S0000067 THE HEART FILLS UP WITH JOY
POD0000001168_S0000078 WELL
POD0000001168_S0000101 MURDEROUS FURY
POD0000001168_S0000122 I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS ONE BEFORE
POD0000001168_S0000138 THERE IS NO END TO CONNECTEDNESS
POD0000001168_S0000154 AND THEN IN A CLOUD COMES A FARM WORKER WHOSE NAME HAPPENS TO BE JESUS LIKE THE MEXICAN FARM WORKERS
POD0000001168_S0000169 IT IS ALWAYS A YES WE BELONG TOGETHER A LIVED YES WE BELONG TOGETHER SO IT'S A DECISION IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE WILL THAN WITH YOUR EMOTIONS OR WITH YOUR THOUGHTS
POD0000001168_S0000178 WRITING THAT GRATITUDE IS SOMETHING FULL-BODIED AND FULL-BLOODED
POD0000001168_S0000184 THE HEART IS THAT CENTER IN WHICH THE HUMAN PERSON IS ONE
POD0000001168_S0000189 AND ISN'T IT FASCINATING THAT WE'RE LIVING IN THIS MOMENT IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WHERE ACTUALLY SCIENCE IS EXCAVATING THIS VIRTUE OF GRATITUDE
POD0000001168_S0000217 AND YOU'RE NEVER QUITE SURE WHICH ONE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU SAY RELIGION
POD0000001168_S0000235 IF WE STAND IN A PARTICULAR RELIGION
POD0000001168_S0000251 ALTHOUGH MONASTICISM
POD0000001168_S0000280 AND A HELP ALSO TO LIVE GRATEFULLY
POD0000001168_S0000301 WAS SO MUCH MORE HORRENDOUS IN TERMS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DYING AND
POD0000001168_S0000318 HOWEVER
POD0000001168_S0000339 AND
POD0000001168_S0000367 YOU'VE SAID THAT GOD IS A DIRECTION RATHER THAN A SOMETHING
POD0000001168_S0000402 WE CANNOT GRASP IT BUT WE CAN UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GRASPING AND UNDERSTANDING
POD0000001168_S0000425 WHEN I AM CONFRONTED WITH SOMETHING
POD0000001168_S0000440 SOME ANSWER EMERGES
POD0000001168_S0000457 A LISTENING HEART
POD0000001176_S0000009 HER PERSONAL PRESENCE HER VISCERAL POWER AND RADIANCE WERE EXTRAORDINARY
POD0000001176_S0000020 FARM AND UNCULTIVATED LAND AROUND COMMUNITIES
POD0000001176_S0000027 IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS
POD0000001176_S0000038 THEY LIVE FOR AS LONG AS THEY CAN
POD0000001176_S0000045 A LOT OF THOSE FIG TREES HAD ACTUALLY BEEN CUT
POD0000001176_S0000053 BUT THEY DEFINITELY WERE AMONG THE SACRED TREES AND WHAT DID YOUR MOTHER MEAN WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE FIG TREE
POD0000001176_S0000061 AND AS I SAY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CUT THEY LAST FOREVER
POD0000001176_S0000069 AND SO THEY SERVED A VERY IMPORTANT PURPOSE
POD0000001176_S0000082 CHRISTIANITY
POD0000001176_S0000102 MY SENSE OF RESPECTING THE RULE OF LAW
POD0000001176_S0000123 AND YOU MOVE INTO ANOTHER WORLD
POD0000001176_S0000131 AND NOW THE CHALLENGE IS TO SEE
POD0000001176_S0000141 SO HOW DID YOU START PLANTING TREES
POD0000001176_S0000157 AND IT STRUCK ME THAT IN THAT PERIOD OF LESS THAN TEN YEARS
POD0000001176_S0000174 IF THEY PLANTED FRUIT TREES THEY CAN SUPPLEMENT THEIR DIETS
POD0000001176_S0000190 IN A SCHOOL THAT WAS RUN MANAGED BY SISTERS
POD0000001176_S0000199 AND WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO INSPIRED YOU
POD0000001176_S0000204 YOUNG WOMEN AND I REMEMBER THINKING NOW WHY DID THEY LEAVE THEIR COUNTRY TO COME HERE
POD0000001176_S0000218 DO THIS
POD0000001176_S0000223 THEY WILL TELL YOU I'LL GO TO HEAVEN WELL OK FINE
POD0000001176_S0000239 MILLIONS OF TREES
POD0000001176_S0000253 HER EARLY WISDOM ABOUT THE LINKS BETWEEN ECOLOGICAL BALANCE AND EVERY OTHER KIND OF HUMAN BALANCE IS SO RESONANT TO THE WORLD WE INHABIT NOW
POD0000001176_S0000258 MEXICO HAITI AND THE HIMALAYAS
POD0000001176_S0000266 WE CAN SUSTAIN OURSELVES FOR A VERY LONG TIME
POD0000001176_S0000281 EVEN THERE
POD0000001176_S0000300 COMING FROM A COUNTRY LIKE JAPAN
POD0000001176_S0000308 BUT IT'S HAPPENING ALL THE TIME
POD0000001176_S0000333 AND I KNEW THAT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER
POD0000001176_S0000342 WHEN I CHALLENGE
POD0000001176_S0000351 SO THE ONLY THING I HAD
POD0000001176_S0000367 YOU NEED THIS FOREST AND THEY SAID WE DON'T NEED THE FOREST WE NEED HOUSES
POD0000001176_S0000398 AND THEN OF COURSE YOU REMEMBER MY OWN BACKGROUND
POD0000001176_S0000408 NOW IF HE IS OMNIPRESENT
POD0000001176_S0000415 BUT I STILL WHEN I LOOK ON MOUNT KENYA

POD0000001184_S0000007 SHE'D JUST WRITTEN A BOOK WHICH GATHERED ITS OWN CONTROVERSY CALLED THE OPPOSITE OF HATE
POD0000001184_S0000012 BUT I COULDN'T LET GO OF A CONVERSATION I HAD AFTER THE EVENT WITH TWO TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRLS WHO WAITED IN A LONG LINE
POD0000001184_S0000017 AND A WILLINGNESS TO BRING OUR QUESTIONS AS WELL AS OUR ARGUMENTS
POD0000001184_S0000038 UNCIVILLY
POD0000001184_S0000052 SHE'S THE TRUMP SUPPORTER I'M OFTEN ON AIR WITH
POD0000001184_S0000073 THOUGHT IT WAS ALLERGIES
POD0000001184_S0000101 AND IF NONE OF US ARE ALLOWED TO MOVE BEYOND THE WORST THING WE'VE DONE
POD0000001184_S0000124 MILDLY IRRITATED BY THE ANNOYANCE OF BEING CALLED THINGS I CAN'T REPEAT ON PUBLIC RADIO ONLINE
POD0000001184_S0000144 AND WE ALL THINK WE'RE JUSTIFIED IN DOING IT BECAUSE OF THEM
POD0000001184_S0000162 AND
POD0000001184_S0000176 BEFORE GLOBALIZATION AND GLOBAL INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND GLOBAL AWARENESS
POD0000001184_S0000195 YOUR AUNT LUCY
POD0000001184_S0000214 JOINED CNN

POD0000001184_S0000249 THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD NOT WITNESSED OR IMAGINED THAT A POLITICAL CONVERSATION LIKE THIS WAS POSSIBLE
POD0000001184_S0000268 THE WAY IN WHICH OUR LIVES AND OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SEGREGATED
POD0000001184_S0000285 BUT IF IT IS ABOUT
POD0000001184_S0000295 OF BEING UNEXPECTEDLY KIND
POD0000001184_S0000307 AND WHO THE TARGETS OF THAT HATE
POD0000001184_S0000323 IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN BEFORE EVIL EVEN ENTERS THE WORLD
POD0000001184_S0000341 WHERE AN UNLOCKED DOOR AND A WARM MEAL COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRUGS DEPRESSION SUICIDE AND THAT IF WE WANT REAL COMMUNITY IT NEEDS TO BE RADICAL COMMUNITY
POD0000001184_S0000367 UNDER FEDERALISM
POD0000001184_S0000387 I KEEP PITCHING THIS TV SHOW WHERE I BRING POLITICIANS IN AND COOK AND WE DON'T TALK POLITICS

POD0000001192_S0000118 IT'S ABOUT KNOWING THAT YOU ARE LIVING AN HONEST LIFE AND KNOWING WHEN YOU ARE NOT
POD0000001192_S0000129 A KNOWINGNESS ABOUT OUR BEING THAT UNITES US TO ALL OF HUMANITY TO ALL OF THE UNIVERSE THAT DESPITE OURSELVES
POD0000001192_S0000136 BUT GOD HAS ALREADY FOUND US REALLY
POD0000001192_S0000141 AND THAT LOVE IS OVERWHELMING AND THAT IS THE BASIC FOUNDATION OF JOY
POD0000001192_S0000153 CALLED MARTIN

POD0000001192_S0000183 HIS DEEP CATHOLIC SPIRITUALITY AND HIS SOCIAL JUSTICE PASSION HAVE BEEN AT THE CENTER OF HIS LIFE BOTH ON-SCREEN AND OFF

POD0000001192_S0000270 OH MY GOD
POD0000001192_S0000293 HOW WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT
POD0000001192_S0000301 REFLECTING THE MOST POWERFUL OFFICE IN THE WORLD
POD0000001192_S0000317 AND EXACTLY ABOVE MY HEAD WAS A STAINED GLASS IMAGE IN THE WINDOW
POD0000001192_S0000329 THERE IS NO SYRIA
POD0000001192_S0000338 THESE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES GETTING OUT AND THEN RISKED THEIR LIVES TRYING TO CROSS EUROPE TRYING TO GET TO A SAFE HAVEN AND TO
POD0000001192_S0000351 THEN IT HAS ITS PURPOSE BUT IT HAS TO BE DISCARDED
POD0000001192_S0000359 ALONE IN REPRESSION
POD0000001192_S0000383 AND THE LAST VOICE YOU HEAR SINGING OUR FINAL CREDITS IN EACH SHOW IS HIP-HOP ARTIST LIZZO
POD0000001200_S0000010 IT'S WHAT WE DO WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT THAT COUNTS
POD0000001200_S0000015 I HAVE BEEN TRACING A QUIETER EVOLUTION BELOW THE RADAR AND BEHIND THE SCENES OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION IN INTERPLAY
POD0000001200_S0000022 BUT HE'S ALSO WRITTEN WIDELY ON THE RATIONALITY OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION IN A CONSTRUCTIVE PARTNERSHIP JIM BRADLEY IS A MATHEMATICIAN WITH A SPECIALTY IN GAME THEORY
POD0000001200_S0000029 IF YOU CAN THINK BACK TO THE EARLIEST ROOTS OF YOUR REFLECTION ON SCIENCE AND RELIGION TOGETHER
POD0000001200_S0000050 AND SO THEY COULDN'T BECOME PRIESTS THEY COULDN'T BECOME SOLDIERS
POD0000001200_S0000066 AND I WAS LOOKING FOR AN ECOLOGICAL NICHE
POD0000001200_S0000089 AS A SCIENTIST
POD0000001200_S0000099 BUT ALSO A PERSON WITH FAIRLY STRONG RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS
POD0000001200_S0000109 THAT'S HOW I SEE GOD
POD0000001200_S0000117 DOING THINGS IN THE WAY THAT CERTAIN TYPE OF CREATIONISTS WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THERE'S AN INSTANTANEOUS SEVEN-DAY CREATION SO GOD WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE RABBIT AND THERE WOULD BE A RABBIT
POD0000001200_S0000134 IS ALSO KNOWLEDGE THAT OUR CULTURE HAS KIND OF LOST
POD0000001200_S0000148 UM
POD0000001200_S0000164 I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO BE SORT OF AN OUT-AND-OUT CULTURAL RELATIVIST OR SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIVIST TO USE THE TRENDY TERM
POD0000001200_S0000181 WELL
POD0000001200_S0000209 HE SWALLOWED THIS HOOK LINE AND SINKER NOW
POD0000001200_S0000218 UM
POD0000001200_S0000233 FOSSIL HUNTING FAMILY
POD0000001200_S0000252 I MEAN YOU KNOW
POD0000001200_S0000263 I REALLY FELT THAT
POD0000001200_S0000275 WE SPOKE IN MINNEAPOLIS AT ON BEING ON LORING PARK
POD0000001200_S0000288 AH PLANETS AND STARS AND EVENTUALLY YOU GET WATER ON EARTH AND LIVING CREATURES ALL THE WAY UP TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY
POD0000001200_S0000312 I THINK WILL TELL YOU MOST OF THEM
POD0000001200_S0000329 FOR PHYSICISTS IT SOMETIMES MEAN AN ABSENCE OF OBSERVABLE CAUSALITY
POD0000001200_S0000343 I KNOW FAR MORE THAN THAT I DON'T KNOW
POD0000001200_S0000350 IT'S A FANTASTICALLY EFFECTIVE WAY TO MANAGE THINGS AND I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY OTHER WAY TO DO IT
POD0000001200_S0000368 OH WELL QUANTUM PHYSICS PROVES FREE WILL QUANTUM PHYSICS MAY DO MANY THINGS IT DOES NOT PROVE FREE WILL
POD0000001200_S0000386 AND THAT WE HAVE A PARTICULAR PLACE IN THE CHRISTIAN WORLD PICTURE LET ME PUT IT THAT WAY
POD0000001200_S0000394 AND SO WITHIN MY WORLD PICTURE
POD0000001200_S0000405 THAT EACH OF THOSE IS LIKE A BRANCH ON A TREE
POD0000001200_S0000418 YOU TALKED ABOUT PURPOSE FOR A LITTLE AH
POD0000001200_S0000449 AND I THINK THAT DARWIN PUT A BOMB IN IT IN THIS WAY HE SAID
POD0000001200_S0000465 UM
POD0000001200_S0000480 I THINK CHRISTIANITY IS IRRELEVANT
POD0000001200_S0000501 UM I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF PUSHING THROUGH HILARY PUTNAM'S BOOK
POD0000001200_S0000514 AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THIS KIND OF THINKING AND THIS KIND OF CHANGE IS ACTUALLY FRIGHTENING
POD0000001200_S0000539 FEEL A SENSE OF BALANCE
POD0000001200_S0000556 THAT SCIENTISTS HAVE THE MOST ROBUST VOCABULARY OF MYSTERY AND WONDER AND THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT RELIGIOUS PEOPLE COULD LEARN FROM
POD0000001200_S0000566 IT'S GIVING THEM THE TOOLS TO
POD0000001200_S0000584 AND IF I LOOK AT THAT AS BEING PART OF THE NATURE OF GOD
POD0000001200_S0000601 I WANT TO THANK THE TWO OF YOU FOR COMING ALL THIS WAY FOR THIS AND THANKS EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE AT ON BEING ON LORING PARK
POD0000001208_S0000008 PROMISING BEGINNING
POD0000001208_S0000014 AND EXHAUSTED REALLY NOT MYSELF AT ALL
POD0000001208_S0000025 I THINK TO BE ON KRISTA'S SHOW ON BEING
POD0000001208_S0000036 AND IT LOOKS AT HOW AGE-OLD ISSUES ARE TAKING NEW FORMS AND PERHAPS INVITING NEW RESPONSES AS WE TRY TO CHART OUR WAY THROUGH THIS YOUNG CENTURY
POD0000001208_S0000046 AMIDST LOTS OF PROHIBITIONS NO DRINKING NO SINGING NO CARD PLAYING
POD0000001208_S0000059 SO ONE THING THAT I STARTED THINKING ABOUT IN THE WRITING OF THE BOOK IS ABOUT
POD0000001208_S0000070 WHO SAYS MAN IS HIS OWN VEXING PROBLEM YES AND WHEN I LISTEN TO YOU I FEEL THAT RELIGIONS ARE VERY EITHER OR
POD0000001208_S0000087 DEFINED AND APPROACHED BY POLITICS
POD0000001208_S0000099 AND THEIR ACCUMULATION OF KNOWLEDGE INTO THE OUTER WORLD
POD0000001208_S0000115 OPENS ALL THIS POSSIBILITY AND IT'S ALSO MORE PLEASURABLE THAN WALKING THROUGH THE WORLD ARMED AND READY TO JUDGE
POD0000001208_S0000129 AND THAT'S ONE OF THEM BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO SELF-EVIDENT
POD0000001208_S0000144 OR SPIRITUAL LIFE
POD0000001208_S0000161 IN AMERICAN CULTURE
POD0000001208_S0000170 I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SUCH A THING AS THE CENTER
POD0000001208_S0000178 AND I THINK
POD0000001208_S0000190 THAT HONORS THE FACT THAT THERE'S DARKNESS BUT ALSO SAYS
POD0000001208_S0000202 ON BEING CONTINUES IN A MOMENT
POD0000001208_S0000215 AND I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT WISDOM REALLY IS
POD0000001208_S0000237 THAT
POD0000001208_S0000249 TO ENGAGE WITH A PERSON WALK INTO THE MYSTERY WITH THAT PERSON
POD0000001208_S0000272 IS THAT YOU HAVE ONE OF YOUR GUESTS TALKING ABOUT HURRICANE KATRINA
POD0000001208_S0000285 AND IT'S ACTUALLY OFTEN IN A CRISIS THAT PEOPLE MOST FORGET THEMSELVES IN THE BEST WAY
POD0000001208_S0000300 AND SHE ASKS THIS QUESTION
POD0000001208_S0000311 THEN INSTANTLY YOU THINK TOMORROW
POD0000001208_S0000332 I'M PICO IYER AND THIS IS ON BEING
POD0000001208_S0000347 BUT THEY DON'T DO DESTINATION RADIO
POD0000001208_S0000368 I LOVE A LOT OF THE JOURNALISM AROUND FOOD NOW
POD0000001208_S0000385 YES
POD0000001208_S0000402 I MUST BE REALLY SPECIAL
POD0000001208_S0000413 I ENDED UP STRESSING IN THE BOOK AND LIKE I HAD TO KEEP REMINDING MYSELF TO STRESS THAT
POD0000001208_S0000429 BUT AS YOU GET OLDER
POD0000001208_S0000445 OK NOW I'M TAKING THE MICROPHONE BACK
POD0000001208_S0000457 THERE'S A NEW EDITION EVERY MONDAY
POD0000001216_S0000007 ONE CRITIC HAS DESCRIBED HIS ART AS AN EFFORT TO DISCERN A DEEPER ORDER THAT UNDERLIES WHAT IS OBSCURED BY THE APPEARANCES OF DISORDER
POD0000001216_S0000016 IT'S ALL THE MORE AMAZING THAT YOU DO IT THE MORE REMARKABLE I'M KRISTA TIPPETT AND THIS IS ON BEING
POD0000001216_S0000027 THAT SOCIALISM WAS OFFICIALLY ATHEIST
POD0000001216_S0000049 YOU THEN GREW UP AND SEEMED TO BE BECOMING A PHYSICIST
POD0000001216_S0000064 I DROPPED OUT OF THE DOCTORATE PROGRAM I WAS DOING THE DOCTORATE AND MFA AT BERKELEY AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000001216_S0000083 THE WAY OF ARTISTS LOOKING AT THE STUDIOS IN THE LAST FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS BUT RATHER AS A LABORATORY
POD0000001216_S0000092 TYPICAL THING OF SCIENTISTS TO DO
POD0000001216_S0000099 EXTREMELY APOLOGETIC TO THE SCIENCES
POD0000001216_S0000114 THE TENSION BETWEEN WHAT SEEMS TO BE AND WHAT IS
POD0000001216_S0000131 EMPIRES OF PLACE AS WELL AS OF MEMORY
POD0000001216_S0000151 AND
POD0000001216_S0000160 IT IS ONLY TO THAT THAT ART CAN SAY ANYTHING
POD0000001216_S0000179 PLACES ME IN A VERY UNSTABLE PLACE
POD0000001216_S0000192 AND THOSE THINGS ARE THE WORK
POD0000001216_S0000205 WHICH THEY THREW AGAINST CORNERS LONG AGO LEFT TO SILENCE
POD0000001216_S0000210 I'M TOTALLY FASCINATED BY IT WAS NOT TIME OR CIRCUMSTANCE THAT DISPLACED YOUR MEMORY
POD0000001216_S0000217 THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE THEM IN SOME MANNER IS
POD0000001216_S0000225 AND
POD0000001216_S0000239 SWIMMING AGAINST THAT CURRENT
POD0000001216_S0000247 AND I SPOKE WITH HIM AT A LIVE EVENT AT BIOLA UNIVERSITY
POD0000001216_S0000260 THAT THIS PROJECT
POD0000001216_S0000269 SO IN MANY WAYS
POD0000001216_S0000284 YOU GAIN THE WORLD IN MANY WAYS
POD0000001216_S0000296 AND I THINK GETTING IN TOUCH WITH THAT WILL MAKE THIS SIMPLISTIC OPPOSITION DISAPPEAR SOMEWHAT
POD0000001216_S0000306 BUT EVEN THOUGH I HAD A CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH IT
POD0000001216_S0000311 AND THAT'S HOW I HAVE APPROACHED IT
POD0000001216_S0000324 YEAH
POD0000001216_S0000331 LIFE AND REALITY AND THE MOMENT SO FULL
POD0000001216_S0000340 THE PROPHET IS NOT A MARTYR OR MYSTIC WHO SEEKS TRANSCENDENCE
POD0000001216_S0000350 OR NOTHING SPECIAL TO OFFER
POD0000001216_S0000366 BUT THE BEST ART HELPS US TO HEAR IT
POD0000001216_S0000375 IT'S TRANSFORMATIVE
POD0000001216_S0000385 IS TO BE MORE QUIET MORE GENTLE
POD0000001216_S0000403 I FELT LIKE I HAD TO BUILD PAINTING FROM THE GROUND UP
POD0000001216_S0000419 WHO WE THINK OF AS A POET BUT IN FACT REALLY THOUGHT OF HIMSELF MORE AS A SCIENTIST
POD0000001216_S0000440 AND YOU WROTE ABOUT THIS ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY
POD0000001216_S0000447 THE CHEMISTRY OF PHOTOGRAPHY HOLDS GRIEF AS A POTENTIAL I JUST THINK THIS IS SO INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT MEMORY AND MOURNING
POD0000001216_S0000456 THERE IS A GRIEF
POD0000001216_S0000471 AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT PHOTOGRAPH
POD0000001216_S0000487 I THINK NOT BECAUSE IT COMES NATURALLY BUT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
POD0000001216_S0000497 TO REMEMBER THAT
POD0000001216_S0000508 AND I DIDN'T
POD0000001216_S0000517 HEROIC HUMAN QUALITY
POD0000001216_S0000531 THERE IS A CERTAIN
POD0000001224_S0000011 WHAT IS OUR RELATIONSHIP TO PLACE AS COMPANIES AND AS WORKERS
POD0000001224_S0000022 THAT I THINK I COULD TELL A SECOND
POD0000001224_S0000048 I WAS DRAWN INTO
POD0000001224_S0000069 IN MY VIEW
POD0000001224_S0000082 FROM THOSE DECENT PEOPLE TO THE INDECENT SYSTEM
POD0000001224_S0000098 WHICH
POD0000001224_S0000113 YOU GO TO A VERY DARK PLACE
POD0000001224_S0000137 AND I THINK RIGHT NOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM IS VERY UNHEALTHY
POD0000001224_S0000151 THEY WOULD ALWAYS HAVE IN ADDITION TO THEIR BUSINESSMAN HAT
POD0000001224_S0000168 BUT I THINK WHEN IT BECOMES THE ONLY LANGUAGE
POD0000001224_S0000182 HE'S QUESTIONING THE MORAL CALCULUS BY WHICH WE TRUST THE MARKET TO SAVE US AND ASK THE WEALTHY TO GIVE BACK BUT NOT TO DO LESS HARM
POD0000001224_S0000209 THERE'S A CHASM BETWEEN
POD0000001224_S0000215 IN AMERICA YOUR PARENTS' INCOME
POD0000001224_S0000223 YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME DISCERNMENT THAT'S THE MUSCLE WE'VE LOST THAT MORAL DISCERNMENT MORAL IMAGINATION
POD0000001224_S0000244 OUR ROLE IN THE INEQUITIES OF OUR AGE MAY NOT BE REMEMBERED WELL
POD0000001224_S0000257 TO INTERROGATE SYSTEMS AND ASK THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ASKING
POD0000001224_S0000271 WHICH ARE SO MUCH BIGGER THAN THEY USED TO BE
POD0000001224_S0000287 BUT ALSO JUST AMERICAN CULTURE
POD0000001224_S0000305 TO THE INFINITY POINT
POD0000001224_S0000320 A BUNCH AROUND THE COUNTRY
POD0000001224_S0000331 THAT IT IS NOT AT A DIAL-TURNING MOMENT NOW
POD0000001224_S0000344 WHICH IS AN END OF THE VENERATION OF MONEY
POD0000001224_S0000352 AND WINNERS TAKE ALL THE ELITE CHARADE OF CHANGING THE WORLD
POD0000001224_S0000363 FIND OUT MORE AT HUMANITYUNITED DOT ORG
POD0000001232_S0000015 IT IS I WOULD SAY A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO PRESENCE AND HEALING IN THE INNER CITY
POD0000001232_S0000030 I SEE THAT HAPPENING I SEE BOTH OF THEIR VOICES RISING UP
POD0000001232_S0000043 UNDERSTAND
POD0000001232_S0000075 AND WAS AGAIN CONSTANTLY EVOLVING
POD0000001232_S0000098 WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT MADE THAT NEIGHBORHOOD WHAT IT WAS
POD0000001232_S0000125 I THINK THAT IF I REMEMBER THIS CORRECTLY
POD0000001232_S0000143 AND PEOPLE DON'T REALLY LIVE WITH THAT TENSION
POD0000001232_S0000152 IN OTHER WORDS YOU NEVER PRAY FOR GOD TO BE JUST WITH YOU
POD0000001232_S0000167 I COULD STRANGELY ENOUGH IDENTIFY WITH THE IMPOSSIBLE POSITION THAT THAT SOLDIER WAS IN
POD0000001232_S0000176 LUCAS WAS GLOBAL COORDINATOR OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF RECONCILIATION
POD0000001232_S0000182 A FORCE FOR HEALING ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO WHERE HE ALSO LIVES WITH HIS FAMILY
POD0000001232_S0000199 AND I WENT TO SCHOOL AT A PREDOMINANTLY WHITE
POD0000001232_S0000210 YEAH I'M FINE WE'RE JUST WALKING AROUND
POD0000001232_S0000224 YEAH BUT COME ON I MEAN
POD0000001232_S0000235 I COULDN'T DO IT IMMEDIATELY
POD0000001232_S0000256 AND THEN ANOTHER COP CAR SHOWS UP
POD0000001232_S0000277 DESPAIR IS JUST SO ANTITHETICAL
POD0000001232_S0000293 AND I SAY TO YOU I HAVE ALSO DECIDED TO STICK TO LOVE
POD0000001232_S0000298 AND I HAVE SEEN TOO MUCH HATE
POD0000001232_S0000314 ORGANIZERS NEED TO BUILD UNAPOLOGETIC POWER
POD0000001232_S0000347 IS BELIEVED THAT LOVE IS GENUINE THAT IT'S AUTHENTIC AND IT'S PART OF WHAT DRIVES
POD0000001232_S0000358 WAS NO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE INVITING THE SOUTHERNERS TO A RESPONSE
POD0000001232_S0000376 AND NOT ALLOWING THAT TO DIE IN OURSELVES IS A PART OF WHAT ENABLES US TO ENGAGE OTHERS IN THAT WAY
POD0000001232_S0000382 DO I LOVE THE WORLD
POD0000001232_S0000395 HE DID NOT SEE THE CARICATURES OF OURSELVES
POD0000001232_S0000406 OUR LOVELY THEME MUSIC IS PROVIDED AND COMPOSED BY ZOE KEATING
POD0000001240_S0000008 I CAN TRULY SAY THAT NO CONVERSATION I'VE HAD IN ALL MY YEARS HAS FELT MORE SEARING IMPORTANT AND ELOQUENT THAN THIS ONE I'M A CHILD OF BLACKNESS
POD0000001240_S0000022 ABOUT THE RELIGIOUS OR SPIRITUAL BACKGROUND OF THEIR CHILDHOOD
POD0000001240_S0000037 AND IT WAS IMPORTANT
POD0000001240_S0000052 HOW DO YOU THINK THAT SHAPES YOU AS AN ARTIST YOUR ARTISTIC IMAGINATION
POD0000001240_S0000062 WE WERE PHILOSOPHIZING CENTURIES AHEAD OF HOW BODIES EXIST WITHIN
POD0000001240_S0000069 MEANS THAT AN ACT OF LOVE IS NOT ONLY REVOLUTIONARY
POD0000001240_S0000088 PERMITTED SURVIVAL TAKE IT ONE LEVEL DEEPER AND WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE NUMINOUS WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE SACRED
POD0000001240_S0000097 LIVE UNDER A TERRIBLE
POD0000001240_S0000104 AND ANOTHER LAYER
POD0000001240_S0000109 BUREAUCRATIC PRECARITY OF BEING AN IMMIGRANT FROM A FATHER WHO COMES OVER ILLEGAL
POD0000001240_S0000120 THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE DISTANCING OURSELVES IT IS BEHIND US
POD0000001240_S0000133 AND THINKING THAT THIS WAS
POD0000001240_S0000143 BUT I WOULD NOT SAY THAT
POD0000001240_S0000155 WHAT'S AT STAKE
POD0000001240_S0000165 SO IS OUR ENTIRE KIND OF
POD0000001240_S0000176 WELL I MEAN ONE ALWAYS RETURNS TO THAT LENIN
POD0000001240_S0000184 THE DIRECT VICTIMS OF WHITE SUPREMACY
POD0000001240_S0000196 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT
POD0000001240_S0000203 COMMISSIONED BY THE NEW YORKER IN THE FACE OF A CHANGED POLITICAL LANDSCAPE
POD0000001240_S0000216 CONTEMPLATION
POD0000001240_S0000224 WE HAVE RECEIVED TREMENDOUS TUTELAGE
POD0000001240_S0000233 I WOULD ARGUE
POD0000001240_S0000248 OF LETTING IN COMPLEXITY AND SUBTLETY
POD0000001240_S0000255 WE HAVE EMACIATED THE OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED BY THESE RELATIONSHIPS
POD0000001240_S0000268 FAMILY
POD0000001240_S0000276 DELICATE
POD0000001240_S0000289 KIND OF ON STEROIDS AT THE PRESENT YEAH I MEAN OURS IS A CANNIBAL LOGIC
POD0000001240_S0000296 OUR POLITICAL ECONOMIC SYSTEMS HAVE DESTABILIZED THE PLANET
POD0000001240_S0000304 WILL HAVE ANY FUTURE WORTH SPEAKING OF
POD0000001240_S0000316 WHAT INTEREST IS THERE IN THE UNIVERSE THEN WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE UNIVERSE
POD0000001240_S0000322 OUR BIOLOGY SEEMS TO DICTATE THAT BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT
POD0000001240_S0000327 THESE NEEDS ARE UNIMPORTANT
POD0000001240_S0000334 WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CIVIC LOVE OR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INTERPERSONAL LOVE
POD0000001240_S0000341 WHICH IS WE ARE INVULNERABLE
POD0000001240_S0000347 HEY MAN THAT HURTS
POD0000001240_S0000352 SO
POD0000001240_S0000358 NOW

POD0000001240_S0000373 AND YET WHO LABORED SUPER-HEROICALLY
POD0000001240_S0000381 IT SURE LOOKS BLEAK
POD0000001240_S0000391 EVEN TO BE REALITY-BASED
POD0000001240_S0000402 AND THEREFORE YEAH THERE'S AN OBSTACLE IN FRONT OF US
POD0000001240_S0000413 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT SCIENCE FICTION IS THERE FOR PEOPLE WHO CHANGE WORLDS WHAT DID YOU SAY A LITTLE WHILE AGO
POD0000001240_S0000426 I WONDER HOW YOUR LONG VIEW OF TIME YOUR ROOTEDNESS IN THE WHOLE SWEEP OF HISTORY OF YOUR ANCESTORS OF YOUR PEOPLE AS THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU STAND IN THE PRESENT
POD0000001240_S0000437 IT'S GOING TO BE THE KINDS OF SOLIDARITIES AND THE KINDS OF CIVIC IMAGINARIES AND THE KINDS OF
POD0000001240_S0000444 AND THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF US ARE SCARED BY OUR MULTIPLICITY SHOWS YOU HOW MUCH WORK WE HAVE TO DO OUR MULTIPLICITY IS OUR DAMN STRENGTH
POD0000001240_S0000456 I TRUST IN THAT I THINK FROM THE BOTTOM WILL THE GENIUS COME THAT MAKES OUR ABILITY TO LIVE WITH EACH OTHER POSSIBLE
POD0000001240_S0000469 ACTUALLY TRAINING US IN REALITY
POD0000001240_S0000483 WORKING TO CREATE A FUTURE WHERE UNIVERSAL SPIRITUAL VALUES FORM THE FOUNDATION OF HOW WE CARE FOR OUR COMMON HOME THE HENRY LUCE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC THEOLOGY REIMAGINED THE OSPREY FOUNDATION A CATALYST FOR EMPOWERED HEALTHY AND FULFILLED LIVES AND THE LILLY ENDOWMENT
POD0000001248_S0000013 IN HER AWARD-WINNING RESEARCH AND WRITING
POD0000001248_S0000019 THE WAY IN WHICH I APPROACH HISTORY COMES FROM TIMES I SPENT WITH MY GRANDMOTHER WHEN I WAS A GIRL
POD0000001248_S0000029 AND IN THE CITY AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000001248_S0000053 SO I'M THINKING NOW ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL LINE AT THE END OF TONI MORRISON'S NOVEL BELOVED
POD0000001248_S0000061 WE WANT TO EXPLORE THEM AND YET WE KNOW THAT IN SOME WAYS
POD0000001248_S0000068 THEY WERE SO REAL TO ME AND SO ALIVE
POD0000001248_S0000080 AND SHE WOULD ATTRIBUTE THESE TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN ANCESTRY THAT SHE WAS CLAIMING FOR HIM SO SHE WOULD RESPOND TO MY DESIRE FOR COMFORT WITH THESE STORIES ABOUT NATIVE ANCESTRY
POD0000001248_S0000094 I MEAN OF COURSE WE OUR ANCESTORS WERE SNATCHED FROM OUR OWN HOMELAND
POD0000001248_S0000105 NATIVE AMERICANS HAVING BLACK AFRICAN SLAVES
POD0000001248_S0000110 ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THAT
POD0000001248_S0000122 WELL I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
POD0000001248_S0000139 AND I FIND THAT WHEN I DO SHARE INFORMATION WITH PEOPLE
POD0000001248_S0000160 BROUGHT HER BACK TO THE CHEROKEE NATION
POD0000001248_S0000170 BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE DOES THAT THROUGH A LANGUAGE OF NEGATIVITY IN WHICH HE
POD0000001248_S0000185 I REALLY ENJOYED KIND OF WALKING THE NEIGHBORHOOD BY MYSELF
POD0000001248_S0000202 BUT I WANTED TO EXPERIENCE A BUILT ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD PERHAPS TAKE ME BACK IN TIME VISCERALLY
POD0000001248_S0000214 I WAS ENJOYING THE HOUSE AESTHETICALLY
POD0000001248_S0000224 NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE
POD0000001248_S0000235 I ONLY WAS AWARE THAT
POD0000001248_S0000249 MORE ABOUT THE IDEA OF PUBLIC HISTORY
POD0000001248_S0000255 TIYA MILES IS AN INTERESTING VOICE IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF PUBLIC HISTORY
POD0000001248_S0000261 THAT AT SOME POINT YOU HAD A CRISIS OF FAITH IN HISTORY THAT ALMOST LED YOU TO QUIT THE FIELD
POD0000001248_S0000269 WAS IN MY GRADUATE STUDENT CLASSROOM WHEN I LEARNED THAT NATIVE PEOPLE OWNED BLACK SLAVES
POD0000001248_S0000279 JEANNIE O'BRIEN
POD0000001248_S0000293 FOR WHOM THIS FIELD MIGHT FEEL NEW

POD0000001248_S0000331 THESE PROJECTS ARE SITUATED WITHIN PUBLIC HISTORY
POD0000001248_S0000340 THERE WAS SOME DISTANCE THERE
POD0000001248_S0000352 WHEN SHE APPLIED FOR FUNDING
POD0000001248_S0000368 YOU'RE PUTTING IT INTO THE CONTEXT OF RELATIONSHIP OVER GENERATIONS AND HUNDREDS OF YEARS
POD0000001248_S0000383 WHICH IS TO CONNECT US ACROSS TIME
POD0000001248_S0000389 IT HAS BEEN HARD IN MOMENTS
POD0000001248_S0000397 THERE WERE ALWAYS INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WHO WERE CONFRONTING THAT AND FACING THEM DOWN AND WILLING TO RISK THEIR OWN LIVES FOR OTHERS
POD0000001248_S0000402 SO IN TERMS OF MAKING HISTORY USEFUL
POD0000001248_S0000414 SO YOU KNOW
POD0000001248_S0000420 CITIZEN OF THE CHEROKEE NATION OF OKLAHOMA WHO ACTUALLY SERVES ON THE TRIBAL COUNCIL THERE AND WHO I ENCOUNTERED YEARS AGO DOING RESEARCH AND HE WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS A LITTLE BIT
POD0000001248_S0000426 AT SOME POINT DURING HIS RESEARCH
POD0000001248_S0000440 EMOTIONAL KNOWLEDGE IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE WAY THAT WE LEARN AND THE WAY THAT WE ANALYZE WHAT IT IS THAT WE FIND
POD0000001248_S0000450 SHE'S ALSO A PROFESSOR OF AMERICAN CULTURE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES AND WOMEN STUDIES

POD0000001256_S0000349 BUT WHATEVER YOU DO WHATEVER YOUR RESPONSE IS
POD0000001256_S0000359 TO DRAMATIZE THE ISSUE
POD0000001256_S0000364 AND DO YOU FEEL LIKE EVEN IN THAT MOMENT
POD0000001256_S0000374 HE SAID HE NEVER GAVE THEM THE ORDER TO BEAT US
POD0000001256_S0000385 AND STOOD
POD0000001256_S0000392 OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MEMORIAL
POD0000001256_S0000401 IT'S A QUIET PROJECT WE TEND AT THE HEART OF WHAT WE DO
POD0000001256_S0000410 A DELEGATION OF OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE ATTENDED
POD0000001256_S0000415 I WAS PRESENT AND VERY PRIVILEGED JUST TODAY HERE IN MONTGOMERY TO WITNESS THE
POD0000001256_S0000426 YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS
POD0000001256_S0000433 AS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IT AS YOU HAVE ASPIRED TO LIVE IT
POD0000001256_S0000440 IT HAS THE ABILITY
POD0000001256_S0000450 A COUNTRY
POD0000001256_S0000457 YOU'VE GOT THAT IN BOTH OF YOUR BOOKS
POD0000001256_S0000468 NOT SIMPLY AS AN EXTENSION OF MY INVOLVEMENT IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
POD0000001256_S0000479 NOT NECESSARILY FORCED
POD0000001256_S0000484 BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT
POD0000001256_S0000497 IT HELPED MAKE THE PERSON WHO'S SUFFERING BETTER
POD0000001256_S0000502 NOT JUST THE LARGER SOCIETY
POD0000001256_S0000508 I FELT FREE
POD0000001256_S0000516 YOUR CIVILITY DEMONSTRATED THE ABSURDITY OF THE OTHER SIDE
POD0000001256_S0000526 WE CANNOT BE PATIENT
POD0000001256_S0000534 YOU CAN SAY ALL OF THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000001256_S0000544 DON'T GET IN A HURRY
POD0000001256_S0000568 WE WANTED PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO REGISTER AND VOTE NOW
POD0000001256_S0000574 WELL I THINK TODAY
POD0000001256_S0000589 REVEREND KING SAID AT TIMES LIFE IS HARD
POD0000001256_S0000596 GIVE UP
POD0000001256_S0000603 AND THINKING ABOUT SEGREGATION AS A THESIS AND THE FIGHT AGAINST DESEGREGATION AS THE ANTITHESIS AND INTEGRATION AS THE SYNTHESIS THE END
POD0000001256_S0000613 TO BRING THESE COMPETING FORCES TOGETHER
POD0000001256_S0000620 HOW DO YOU PAINT THE PICTURE
POD0000001256_S0000632 THAT
POD0000001256_S0000639 THERE MAY BE SOME INTERRUPTION
POD0000001256_S0000648 DURING YOUR TIME
POD0000001256_S0000653 GOOD TROUBLE
POD0000001256_S0000668 THAT TRULY HISTORIC APOLOGY BY THE CHIEF OF POLICE OF MONTGOMERY
POD0000001256_S0000677 HELPING TO BUILD THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION FOR A LOVING WORLD
POD0000001264_S0000014 THE ROMANS BUILT ROADS ONE ADAGE GOES
POD0000001264_S0000020 IN COMMON WITH MANY WESTERN CHRISTIANS
POD0000001264_S0000032 THERE IS A KIND OF EIGHT-DAY CYCLE EIGHT-DAY CYCLE
POD0000001264_S0000037 SEVEN DAYS
POD0000001264_S0000047 WELL FOR EXAMPLE
POD0000001264_S0000058 NOT GOOD
POD0000001264_S0000068 BUT IT'S STILL THE SONG
POD0000001264_S0000076 YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE HUGE IDEAS THAT IN FACT HAPPEN FOR YOU IN WORSHIP WELL IF YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AT THE ORTHODOX LITURGIES
POD0000001264_S0000099 AND THAT ENGAGES THE WHOLE HUMAN BEING WELL THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE CHRISTIAN BELIEF IN THE BODILY RESURRECTION
POD0000001264_S0000107 SO I WANT TO LIVE AND GO ON LIVING EVEN IF IT'S CONTRARY TO THE RULES OF LOGIC EVEN IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE DIVINE ORDER OF THINGS
POD0000001264_S0000112 YOU DON'T LOVE THOSE THINGS WITH REASON WITH LOGIC
POD0000001264_S0000119 AND THE QUESTION IS
POD0000001264_S0000133 JUST AS THE BIBLE ITSELF CONTAINS VARIED METAPHORS FOR EXPLAINING THE EASTER EVENTS
POD0000001264_S0000143 THAT IT'S A PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION
POD0000001264_S0000153 LET'S START TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU DO IN YOUR GARDEN WHAT YOU LEARN FROM YOUR GARDEN THE
POD0000001264_S0000166 AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN YOU ARE IN YOUR GARDEN
POD0000001264_S0000174 AND WE'RE ALL JUST STARING UP AT THAT CANOPY UP THERE YOU KNOW
POD0000001264_S0000183 SO WHAT DO WE SEE
POD0000001264_S0000194 I FELT AS IF I WAS IN A GREAT CATHEDRAL FOR A MOMENT THERE
POD0000001264_S0000205 IN THE BEGINNING IN MY FIRST GARDEN IN RICHMOND VIRGINIA
POD0000001264_S0000213 I CULTIVATE CAREFULLY THE ASPARAGUS ROW NOT JUST FOR THE TASTE OF ITS BUTTERY SPEARS BUT ALSO FOR THE VERDANT FERN FOLIAGE THAT SHOOTS UP AFTER THE SPRING CUTTING
POD0000001264_S0000222 ALSO VIEW IMAGES OF THE RICH ICONOGRAPHY AND RITUALS OF THE EASTERN ORTHODOX CHURCH
POD0000001264_S0000236 THAT WAS OBLIGATORY
POD0000001264_S0000250 HE MOVED FROM MARYLAND TO FIVE ACRES IN VIRGINIA
POD0000001264_S0000257 AND IT COMES TO US WITH SURPRISE
POD0000001264_S0000268 AND I DON'T EVEN SEE IT BUT I KNOW IT'S PRESENT
POD0000001264_S0000274 WE MAY NOT SEE GOD FACE TO FACE OR TANGIBLY EXPERIENCE HIM IN OTHER WAYS NONETHELESS HE AVAILS HIMSELF TO US AS HE DID TO ADAM AND EVE IN THE GARDEN
POD0000001264_S0000287 AND IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THIS TASK WHICH ONE WOULD RATHER AVOID IN CERTAIN DAYS IN PARTICULAR WHEN THE WEATHER ISN'T SO GREAT PERHAPS
POD0000001264_S0000301 HERE'S A PASSAGE FROM ARMENIAN APOCRYPHAL ADAM LITERATURE AS PUBLISHED IN VIGEN GUROIAN'S THE FRAGRANCE OF GOD
POD0000001264_S0000307 BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY
POD0000001264_S0000314 NEVERTHELESS WE ARE NO LONGER IN THE DARKNESS AND CAN GO ON LIVING
POD0000001264_S0000324 BUT SOME OF ITS FRAGRANCE WAFTS INTO MY GARDEN
POD0000001264_S0000335 I REALIZED THAT ADAM AND EVE WERE EXPELLED FROM EDEN WHEREAS I WILLINGLY LEFT MY GARDEN
POD0000001264_S0000345 AND I FELT AS IF I LANDED ON A DIFFERENT PLANET
POD0000001264_S0000359 YOU SPOKE ABOUT HOW
POD0000001264_S0000374 REALLY IS THAT A HYMN
POD0000001264_S0000385 AND I CAN REMEMBER THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
POD0000001264_S0000400 I MEAN
POD0000001264_S0000408 WHICH IS TO SAY THAT IT'S ALL VERY PRESENT
POD0000001264_S0000427 I DON'T MEAN THAT IN A GORY SENSE
POD0000001264_S0000438 HIS BOOKS INCLUDE THE FRAGRANCE OF GOD AND INHERITING PARADISE
POD0000001264_S0000448 WHEN MY WIFE SAID THAT SHE FEARED THE TURTLES MIGHT BE DEAD
POD0000001264_S0000459 WE HEARD FROM VIGEN GUROIAN THAT HE'S JUST BUILT A NEW GRAPE ARBOR IN HIS GARDEN WITH THE HELP OF SOME STUDENTS
POD0000001264_S0000464 SOME OF OUR RICHEST EXCHANGES ARE TAKING PLACE NOW ON OUR BLOG WHERE WE DO WELCOME YOUR SUBMISSIONS
POD0000001272_S0000005 THEY'RE SEEING PRACTICAL OFTEN COMMON-SENSE TRUTHS ABOUT HOW WE PRIME OUR BRAINS TO UNLOCK WHAT IS NOVEL AND USEFUL REX JUNG HAS NOTABLY HELPED DESCRIBE SOMETHING CALLED TRANSIENT HYPOFRONTALITY
POD0000001272_S0000017 IN THIS ROLE HE SAYS HE'S A KIND OF EXISTENTIAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST
POD0000001272_S0000040 SOCIALLY RETARDED
POD0000001272_S0000051 BUT WITHIN A GIVEN SOCIAL CONTEXT IT MIGHT NOT BE RECOGNIZED AT THAT TIME VAN GOGH IS A GOOD EXAMPLE
POD0000001272_S0000062 MORE NEURONS
POD0000001272_S0000079 OR WHAT IT REALLY MEASURED
POD0000001272_S0000108 THEY DECIDED TO SEVER THE CORPUS CALLOSUM SO THAT THE SEIZURES COULDN'T PROGRESS FROM ONE HEMISPHERE TO THE OTHER
POD0000001272_S0000122 BUT YOU WON'T GET AS CREATIVE WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO PLEASE EACH OTHER THAN WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE
POD0000001272_S0000148 WHO ALSO JUST TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW BEING A CHILD AND HOW BACK THEN HE DID NOT HAVE A SCHEDULE
POD0000001272_S0000171 ON BEING CONTINUES IN A MOMENT
POD0000001272_S0000177 OF CREATIVITY AS GIVING RISE TO SOMETHING THAT IS BOTH NOVEL AND USEFUL
POD0000001272_S0000194 AND NOW WE'RE STARTING TO FACE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IF WE COULD MAKE OURSELVES MORE INTELLIGENT
POD0000001272_S0000219 CERTAINLY A GENIUS CERTAINLY
POD0000001272_S0000244 SO IT'S OFTEN THE TASK IS TO
POD0000001272_S0000258 I THINK THIS IS IT SO
POD0000001272_S0000279 I THINK THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT
POD0000001272_S0000307 YOU NEED TO GET SOME STUFF IN YOUR HEAD
POD0000001272_S0000317 AND THEN RESEARCH WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED UPON THIS BUT RESEARCH ALMOST INVARIABLY SHOWS THAT HIGHLY CREATIVE PEOPLE PUT OUT LOTS AND LOTS OF IDEAS
POD0000001272_S0000337 BUT THOSE PEOPLE
POD0000001272_S0000357 MUTUAL OF AMERICA IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING QUALITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO HELP YOU BUILD AND PRESERVE ASSETS FOR A FINANCIALLY SECURE FUTURE
POD0000001280_S0000018 CIRCLING ONE OF THOSE STARS UP THERE
POD0000001280_S0000040 BUT YOU DID NEVERTHELESS BECOME ONE OF THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO EMBARK ON
POD0000001280_S0000057 ONE WEEK SHY OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER
POD0000001280_S0000072 SO I THINK THAT PART OF THE LESSON THERE IS WE NEED TO STOP PROJECTING WHAT WE THINK ONTO WHAT WE DON'T YET KNOW
POD0000001280_S0000081 BECAUSE ALL BIOLOGY THAT WE KNOW
POD0000001280_S0000095 BUT SOMETHING CALLED EXOBIOLOGY DID
POD0000001280_S0000102 WHOSE LIFE DETECTION EXPERIMENTS ON THE SURFACE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL
POD0000001280_S0000119 A WAY OF POINTING AT THAT SCIENCE FICTION CHILDHOOD QUESTION YEAH ACTUALLY THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I AM ALWAYS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT TALKING ABOUT SETI AND WORKING ON THE PROBLEM BECAUSE
POD0000001280_S0000127 TECHNOLOGICAL CIVILIZATIONS LAST A LONG TIME
POD0000001280_S0000139 THEN THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY
POD0000001280_S0000149 LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL LIFE NOW
POD0000001280_S0000159 OR IS THAT LIFE RELATED TO US AND IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE CALL PANSPERMIA SPREADING LIFE AROUND
POD0000001280_S0000177 I DID AN EXERCISE WHEN SETI WAS FIFTY YEARS OLD
POD0000001280_S0000183 AND WHAT FRACTION OF THAT HAVE WE SAMPLED AND EXPLORED IN FIFTY YEARS
POD0000001280_S0000193 BUT INDEED
POD0000001280_S0000207 SO THE ARCHEOLOGY PIECE IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD
POD0000001280_S0000222 THAT YOU CONTINUE YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS INTO WONDERING
POD0000001280_S0000229 DIFFERENCES THAT WE'RE SO WILLING TO SHED BLOOD OVER
POD0000001280_S0000239 THIS MOVIE CHANGED ME WHEREVER PODCASTS ARE FOUND
POD0000001280_S0000247 AND THAT YOU SEE IN OUR TIME SCIENCE PROVIDING RAW MATERIAL FOR ALL KINDS OF NEW FORMS OF EXPRESSION
POD0000001280_S0000257 SO I THINK WE NEED TO TELL OUR STUDENTS THAT SCIENCE IS A FANTASTIC WAY OF SPENDING A CAREER AND HAVING FUN AND BEING CHALLENGED AND NEVER BEING BORED
POD0000001280_S0000267 HAS A LOVELY PHRASE LIKE ONE OF PHILIP MORRISON'S HE SAYS THAT ON A FINITE WORLD AND THE EARTH IS DEFINITELY FINITE A COSMIC PERSPECTIVE IS NOT A LUXURY IT'S ACTUALLY A NECESSITY
POD0000001280_S0000280 POSIT THAT SUPPOSE WE WERE AWARE OF AN ALIEN FLEET
POD0000001280_S0000286 SO THE FACT THAT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT POLITICAL ARENAS DENY THAT THERE IS AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS RIGHT NOW IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING TO ME
POD0000001280_S0000300 DIFFERENT SPECIES
POD0000001280_S0000307 TO HAVE THESE ARTISTS WHO CAN REIMAGINE THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND LET US LOOK AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT LENS
POD0000001280_S0000314 IF WE CAN GET IT FUNDED
POD0000001280_S0000321 THAT
POD0000001280_S0000339 WE'VE JUST BARELY BEGUN TO
POD0000001280_S0000347 IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S A RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY INTELLIGENT BEING ON THIS PLANET TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOES NOT GO AWAY
POD0000001280_S0000359 IT IS JUST SO AWESOME
POD0000001280_S0000372 BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT
POD0000001280_S0000382 TO REALLY PROBE SOMETHING THAT'S LARGER THAN WE ARE
POD0000001280_S0000389 SO I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER ANY OF THAT LIFE ELSEWHERE HAS EVOLVED INTO TECHNOLOGICAL CIVILIZATIONS
POD0000001280_S0000400 SHE HAS BEEN AWARDED TWO EXCEPTIONAL PUBLIC SERVICE MEDALS FROM NASA AND THE WOMEN IN AEROSPACE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD
POD0000001288_S0000007 WHICH IT TURNS OUT
POD0000001288_S0000032 THIS ACTUALLY DOES WORK NOW THERE ARE LIMITS TO IT
POD0000001288_S0000050 BUT THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING
POD0000001288_S0000060 THERE'S SOME KIND OF PLACEBO EFFECT GOING ON IN TERMS OF HOW QUICKLY WE FEEL THEY WORK
POD0000001288_S0000126 THIS IS ABOUT THE POWER OF BELIEF
POD0000001288_S0000147 AND SHE ALSO TALKS ABOUT THE THEATER OF ROMANCE AND RELATIONSHIP AND THE EROTIC AND HOW THAT
POD0000001288_S0000194 WE CREATED LIBRARIES FROM OUR FIFTEEN YEAR ARCHIVE FOR BROWSING OR DEEP DIVING BY THEME FOR TEACHING AND REFLECTION AND CONVERSATION
POD0000001288_S0000230 BUT ECHINACEA REALLY WORKS IT'S LIKE
POD0000001288_S0000259 IS NOT RESETTING THE BRAIN IT'S GIVING A RUSH OF ENDORPHINS AND SO
POD0000001288_S0000286 WRITING MY BOOK MIGHT
POD0000001288_S0000359 AND WHEN WE FIND THOSE THINGS WE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO
POD0000001288_S0000377 HELPING TO BUILD THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION FOR A LOVING WORLD
POD0000001296_S0000009 HE SAYS THAT WORKS OF ART THAT SPEAK TO HUMANITY ACROSS TIME POSSESS THEIR OWN FORM OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THAT A QUIET LIFE OF PURPOSE IS A PARTICULAR FORM OF PROPHECY
POD0000001296_S0000020 HE STUDIED ENGINEERING PHYSICS AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS AT CORNELL AND BERKELEY BEFORE LEAVING SCIENCE FOR ART
POD0000001296_S0000029 THE RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL BACKGROUND OF YOUR CHILDHOOD THERE
POD0000001296_S0000058 AND I WAS REALLY DESTINED TO DO THAT FOR MY LIFE
POD0000001296_S0000071 ALTHOUGH SUPPORTING YOUR ART HABIT BY BUILDING LASERS IS
POD0000001296_S0000087 WHEN I TAKE ON A NEW PROJECT
POD0000001296_S0000095 MY INTEREST IN PHILOSOPHY I THINK COMES FROM PHYSICS
POD0000001296_S0000107 IMAGES FIGHT BACK AND THEIR MEANINGS PLAY HIDE-AND-GO-SEEK WITH MATERIALS
POD0000001296_S0000124 THE IDEA OF EMPIRES
POD0000001296_S0000143 GOD
POD0000001296_S0000156 INDIVIDUAL FAILURE
POD0000001296_S0000172 THEY THEMSELVES HAVING SOME CONSCIOUSNESS I GUESS ANIMATED OPEN ENGAGEMENT
POD0000001296_S0000186 AND I THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING DISTINCTION TOO
POD0000001296_S0000202 IT WAS NOT TIME OR CIRCUMSTANCE THAT DISPLACED YOUR MEMORY
POD0000001296_S0000207 HAD THE FLOWERS OF LAUGHTER
POD0000001296_S0000214 I FIND THAT SOMETIMES IN MY EXPERIENCE OF
POD0000001296_S0000219 ALMOST A PRACTICE OF FORGETFULNESS
POD0000001296_S0000233 AND WHO I WAS AND WHO ARE THE PEOPLE AROUND AND
POD0000001296_S0000244 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT AND THIS IS ON BEING
POD0000001296_S0000251 I WALKED AWAY AND I WAS DIFFERENT
POD0000001296_S0000265 HAD THIS SENSE OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY
POD0000001296_S0000276 I COULD SEE IT
POD0000001296_S0000287 WITHOUT NECESSARILY TRYING TO TIE IT UP TO
POD0000001296_S0000301 ALSO OF AN AWARENESS OF MORAL FAILINGS
POD0000001296_S0000308 I WANT
POD0000001296_S0000319 YOUR IDEA OF A PAINTING
POD0000001296_S0000328 AND THAT SECRET THAT IS IN EVERYTHING
POD0000001296_S0000333 THAT
POD0000001296_S0000342 MEAN I THINK THERE IS A TENDENCY
POD0000001296_S0000354 THE NOTION THAT TO BRING THE FUTURE FORWARD
POD0000001296_S0000371 SILENT ENOUGH BE ABLE TO LOOK AND LISTEN
POD0000001296_S0000380 IT'S INTERESTING TO PONDER THAT
POD0000001296_S0000395 THE KIND OF GIVING UP
POD0000001296_S0000407 FOR ME
POD0000001296_S0000431 A PROFOUND PART OF
POD0000001296_S0000444 TAKING A PICTURE
POD0000001296_S0000449 SO MUCH MORE MEANING THAN WE ATTRIBUTE NOW
POD0000001296_S0000464 THAT PHOTOGRAPH KNEW EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO COME
POD0000001296_S0000483 HOW WOULD YOU START TO ANSWER THE QUESTION HOW YOU THINK NOW ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN HOW YOUR SENSE OF THAT HAS EVOLVED TO THIS AT THIS POINT
POD0000001296_S0000491 FOUR KIDS AND WITH A WORLD
POD0000001296_S0000501 THIS MORNING I
POD0000001296_S0000511 AND OUR CAPACITY TO SURVIVE THEM TO MOVE ON
POD0000001296_S0000527 IT SEEMS AMAZING THAT THEY CAN SUSTAIN HOPE AGAINST
POD0000001296_S0000541 OUR FUNDING PARTNERS INCLUDE THE JOHN TEMPLETON FOUNDATION THE FETZER INSTITUTE
POD0000001304_S0000008 INVITED HIM TO SHABBAT DINNER
POD0000001304_S0000023 WE KNEW THAT DEREK HAD GROWN UP IN A WHITE NATIONALIST FAMILY AMONGST WHITE NATIONALIST ROYALTY SO TO SPEAK
POD0000001304_S0000032 I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT THAT DURING THOSE COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN I KEPT COMING BACK TO MATTHEW'S SHABBAT DINNERS
POD0000001304_S0000046 WOULD YOU THINK OF HATE AS BEING WHAT IT WAS ABOUT NO
POD0000001304_S0000054 I THINK SO
POD0000001304_S0000075 AND DOES THAT STRIKE THE TWO OF YOU NOW AS YOU LOOK BACK BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT INTELLIGENCE FOR THE REST OF US TO FIGURE OUT HOW DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS AND TURN OUT THIS WAY BUT ALSO THERE WAS THAT INVESTMENT OF TIME AND RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU MADE
POD0000001304_S0000083 THAT'S TWO YEARS OF EVERY WEEK COMING OVER
POD0000001304_S0000113 ULTIMATELY
POD0000001304_S0000127 MY FATHER WAS A BUILDER OF BRIDGES ACROSS GENERATIONS HE VALUED FRIENDSHIP AS AN IDEAL ABOVE ALL OTHERS
POD0000001304_S0000136 LATER ON WELL AFTER TWO YEARS IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD WE'D EVEN PLAY GAMES BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT I KNEW
POD0000001304_S0000152 AND EVENTUALLY
POD0000001304_S0000161 BECAUSE WHAT ALSO HAPPENED THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING
POD0000001304_S0000175 AND IT WAS ONE LAST HARD THING TO REALIZE THAT I HAD DONE TOO MUCH DAMAGE IN MY ACTIVISM TO JUST BE QUIET NOW
POD0000001304_S0000187 MATTHEW STEVENSON ONE OF THE ONLY ORTHODOX JEWS ON THE CAMPUS THEY BOTH ATTENDED
POD0000001304_S0000193 TO THOSE ENERGIES AND THOSE IDEOLOGIES THAT YOU WERE A PART OF
POD0000001304_S0000208 EVERY MESSAGE REALLY HAS TWO COMPONENTS THERE IS THE CONTENT OF THE MESSAGE
POD0000001304_S0000213 BELIEVE WHITE NATIONALISM TO BE
POD0000001304_S0000219 BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING STRONG AND VIOLATING THE HUMANITY OF ANOTHER PERSON
POD0000001304_S0000228 THAT'S ACTUALLY A PICTURE THAT IS UNFAMILIAR IS BECOMING LESS FAMILIAR TO US
POD0000001304_S0000241 AND THAT KIND OF POSITIVE REACTION WAS VERY ENCOURAGING AND AT NEW COLLEGE
POD0000001304_S0000253 HELP YOU SOFTEN OTHER KINDS OF EXPERIENCES I DON'T KNOW
POD0000001304_S0000269 TODAY A PUBLIC CONVERSATION WITH DEREK BLACK ONCE A WHITE NATIONALIST HEIR APPARENT
POD0000001304_S0000282 AND IT'S ALSO NOT SO EASY TO SAY OH DON'T COVER THEM
POD0000001304_S0000290 IT'S TOO BIG BUT I THE ONLY LESSON THAT I THINK THAT I TOOK FROM MY EXPERIENCE THAT I FEEL IS FAIRLY UNIVERSAL IS THAT IT WAS GROUNDED IN EMPATHY
POD0000001304_S0000306 ONE OF OF COURSE THE GREAT ADVANTAGES OF THE DIGITAL WORLD IS THAT YOU CAN REACH SO MANY PEOPLE INSTANTANEOUSLY
POD0000001304_S0000312 MUCH HARDER TO DISCOUNT THE PERSON'S HUMANITY WHEN HE'S STARING YOU IN THE EYES
POD0000001304_S0000321 MAKES YOU DESPAIR
POD0000001304_S0000328 AND THAT'S WHY I SEE PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE MY FRIENDS WHO I LOVE DEARLY
POD0000001304_S0000336 AND WHAT GIVES YOU HOPE
POD0000001304_S0000347 AND NOW I THINK I'M BACK TO BEING CONFIDENT
POD0000001304_S0000357 THANK YOU SO MUCH DEREK AND MATTHEW FOR MODELING THAT
POD0000001304_S0000370 WORKING TO CREATE A FUTURE WHERE UNIVERSAL SPIRITUAL VALUES FORM THE FOUNDATION OF HOW WE CARE FOR OUR COMMON HOME HUMANITY UNITED
POD0000001312_S0000012 HE SOUGHT MEANING IN SCIENCE
POD0000001312_S0000018 WHO SEEMED RATHER INTERESTING AN OLDER GENTLEMAN
POD0000001312_S0000026 OPENED UP BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN A LONGTIME MEDITATOR HIMSELF OH OK AND SO HAD A FORM OF CONTEMPLATIVE SPIRITUALITY THAT BEGAN TO MAKE SENSE IN TERMS OF SCIENCE
POD0000001312_S0000049 A GENTLEMAN
POD0000001312_S0000070 THIS IS SOME LINES OF HIS COLORS ARE THE DEEDS AND SUFFERINGS OF LIGHT
POD0000001312_S0000094 THEY EXPLORE THE RELEVANCE OF CONTEMPLATIVE TRADITIONS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
POD0000001312_S0000102 SO COGNITIVELY ORIENTED CONTEMPLATIVE SPIRITUALITY NOW CONTEMPLATIVE SPIRITUALITY
POD0000001312_S0000108 I'VE DISCOVERED SOMETHING THROUGH AGAIN THE SAME KIND OF EPIPHANOUS
POD0000001312_S0000126 RIGHT YEAH
POD0000001312_S0000149 AND WHAT ONE HAD A FEELING THAT WAS GOING ON WAS THIS WAS LONG OVERDUE
POD0000001312_S0000161 THEN THAT WILL HAVE EDUCATIONAL PEDAGOGICAL IMPLICATIONS
POD0000001312_S0000183 IN FACT WE ONLY SEE DARKNESS YEAH
POD0000001312_S0000198 BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE INTEGRAL OURSELVES YOU KNOW HAVE A PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS WHOLE
POD0000001312_S0000207 HERE'S HOW IT BEGINS
POD0000001312_S0000213 THEN THE THIRD PART WILL BE A LETTING GO OF THE BELL SOUND COMPLETELY
POD0000001312_S0000223 MOST INTENSIVELY IN A TRADITION MODELED BY THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AUSTRIAN PHILOSOPHER AND EDUCATOR RUDOLPH STEINER
POD0000001312_S0000229 TECHNOLOGY AS IT'S EVOLVING
POD0000001312_S0000249 ALL THE REST
POD0000001312_S0000270 AND FRAMES IT AS SUCH
POD0000001312_S0000281 LIFE WILL BE MORE BURDENSOME FOR ME
POD0000001312_S0000288 THE RICHNESS OF YOUR LIFE MEANS THAT YOU BEGIN TO CARRY CONCERNS THAT YOU MAYBE NEGLECTED BEFORE
POD0000001312_S0000303 NOT THESE OTHER WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND SO ON
POD0000001312_S0000319 AND THEN WHEN YOU RELEASE THE IMAGE AND BECOME VERY STILL AND QUIET AND OPEN YOURSELF WIDE
POD0000001312_S0000336 AS A PERSON THEY LOVE BUT ALSO A PERSON WHO IS LIKELY
POD0000001312_S0000349 THAT'S THE WAY PARKINSON'S WORKS
POD0000001312_S0000358 ACTIVE IN THE WORLD AND YET HAVE SUCH CALM SUCH KIND OF INNER OPENNESS AND PRESENCE THAT ONE CAN LEAD A LIFE
POD0000001312_S0000373 THAT INTERPRETATION OF MYSTERY IT'S TOO EASY
POD0000001312_S0000382 SEE FURTHER
POD0000001312_S0000398 AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE CARE FOR EACH OF THESE SO THAT WHEN WE DO ACT
POD0000001312_S0000410 AND AT ONBEING DOT ORG
POD0000001320_S0000006 BUT HE HAS PRACTICAL AND SPIRITUAL TOOLS ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE FOR SLOWING DOWN TIME AND OPENING TO OUR LIVES
POD0000001320_S0000018 WE FOCUSED IN ON MY FAVORITE BOOK HE'S WRITTEN COMING TO OUR SENSES HEALING OURSELVES AND THE WORLD THROUGH MINDFULNESS
POD0000001320_S0000030 AND THEN MY MOTHER WAS AS PROLIFIC AS A PAINTER AS MY FATHER WAS IN WRITING SCIENTIFIC PAPERS AND TRAINING GRADUATE STUDENTS AND POST-DOCS AND SO FORTH
POD0000001320_S0000055 REGULAR MAINSTREAM AMERICANS WOULD TAKE TO MEDITATION AND
POD0000001320_S0000069 IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS
POD0000001320_S0000081 MINDFULNESS IS NOT ABOUT THOUGHT RIGHT I MEAN YOUR BOOK
POD0000001320_S0000091 AND SO WHEN YOU BEGIN TO CULTIVATE INTIMACY WITH THESE OTHER CAPACITIES
POD0000001320_S0000109 THEY DON'T LIVE IN FEAR OF BEING LAID OFF ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
POD0000001320_S0000120 OF COURSE HAVING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE PAY THE RENT
POD0000001320_S0000133 WE HAVE A BODY
POD0000001320_S0000147 SO SEE IF YOU CAN JUST FEEL YOURSELF BREATHING
POD0000001320_S0000161 IT STILL SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS YEAH SEE AGAIN THERE'S THIS KIND OF PARADOX WHEN YOU USE A TERM LIKE AWARENESS WHICH AGAIN SOUNDS LIKE A MENTAL ACTIVITY BUT WHAT YOU ASK PEOPLE TO DO AND HOW THEY BECOME AWARE IS TO DROP INTO THEIR BODIES AND THEIR SENSES YEAH DROP INTO BEING
POD0000001320_S0000170 OFFER US IS A CHANCE TO CONTINUALLY RETURN TO WHAT'S DEEPEST AND BEST IN OURSELVES
POD0000001320_S0000179 OK AND IT PUTS US IN TOUCH WITH A WHOLE DIFFERENT DIMENSION THAN THINKING
POD0000001320_S0000201 BUT IN A SENSE OPENING TO OUR LIVES
POD0000001320_S0000214 HE'S HELPED BRING MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION INTO MAINSTREAM MEDICINE AND SOCIETY FROM PEOPLE LIVING WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS TO OLYMPIC ATHLETES TO CORPORATE BOARDROOMS
POD0000001320_S0000223 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THAT
POD0000001320_S0000231 ALL OF THAT
POD0000001320_S0000252 BUT ONE PIECE OF IT HASN'T DEVELOPED YET AND THAT IS OUR INTIMACY OUR DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN
POD0000001320_S0000263 AND SINCE IT'S HAPPENING
POD0000001320_S0000277 TODAY JON KABAT-ZINN'S SCIENCE OF MINDFULNESS
POD0000001320_S0000293 SO THE REAL CHALLENGE HERE IS AS YOU POSED IT AT THE BEGINNING
POD0000001320_S0000314 EAT
POD0000001320_S0000320 PEEL YOUR OWN IMAGE FROM THE MIRROR
POD0000001320_S0000328 HE'S RETURNED SEVERAL TIMES IN RECENT YEARS
POD0000001320_S0000342 THAT THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS OUTSIDE AND YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY THE CENTER OF IT
POD0000001320_S0000348 WE WORK A LOT WITH MEDICAL PATIENTS WHO HAVE TREMENDOUS SUFFERING OUR TRACK RECORD WITH THE DEAD IS NOT SO GOOD
POD0000001320_S0000357 SO IS EVERYBODY ELSE
POD0000001320_S0000362 FOR LEARNING FOR GROWING
POD0000001328_S0000005 RUMI UNDERSTOOD SEARCHING AND RESTLESSNESS AS A KIND OF ARRIVAL
POD0000001328_S0000017 WHEN HE WAS A CHILD HIS FAMILY FLED MONGOL INVADERS AND SETTLED IN KONYA IN PRESENT-DAY TURKEY
POD0000001328_S0000023 HE ALSO INSPIRED THE WHIRLING DERVISHES
POD0000001328_S0000028 FATEMEH KESHAVARZ CALLS RUMI A WORLD-CLASS THINKER
POD0000001328_S0000036 AND SHE OFTEN SETS RUMI'S WORDS TO MUSIC
POD0000001328_S0000046 BUT ON ANOTHER LEVEL IT WAS COMPLETELY NEW BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE PLAYED WITH IT
POD0000001328_S0000053 PUT IT ASIDE AND LIVE IT ENCOUNTER IT
POD0000001328_S0000061 ALL OF A SUDDEN I REALIZED I CAN'T STAY ON THE MARGINS

POD0000001328_S0000087 WHICH SEEMS AT ONCE ADDRESSED TO ALLAH OR GOD AND TO AN EARTHLY BELOVED
POD0000001328_S0000098 AND EVEN DON'T ASK EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
POD0000001328_S0000107 WE HAVE TO APPRECIATE THAT AND IN ORDER TO APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE TO JOIN THE DANCE
POD0000001328_S0000118 WHICH AGAIN YOU KIND OF HAVE TO INTRODUCE A WESTERNER INTO
POD0000001328_S0000126 IT'S THE SAME HUMAN EXPERIENCE
POD0000001328_S0000139 LIKE THIS
POD0000001328_S0000147 LIKE THIS
POD0000001328_S0000157 LIKE THIS

POD0000001328_S0000179 HE SAID WELL GO TRY THAT FIRST
POD0000001328_S0000187 RUMI REFLECTS ON THE HUMAN SPIRIT THROUGH THE METAPHOR OF THE ANCIENT REED FLUTE OR NEY THAT'S POPULAR IN MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC
POD0000001328_S0000192 I HAVE MADE THIS CRYING SOUND
POD0000001328_S0000208 YOU HAVE TO GET STARTED
POD0000001328_S0000215 THE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD IS INHERENT IN THAT INCOMPLETENESS
POD0000001328_S0000220 I HAVE ARRIVED I'VE REACHED THIS IS IT

POD0000001328_S0000287 ARE NOT ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE DESIRE TO DO
POD0000001328_S0000308 LIKE THE REFLECTION OF A FORMER ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST WHO SHARED HOW RUMI HELPED HIM THROUGH A PERIOD OF TRANSITION
POD0000001328_S0000318 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT
POD0000001328_S0000325 BORN IN THE CENTER OF PERSIAN ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION
POD0000001328_S0000331 ISLAM IMAGINES FAITH AS ZIKR OR REMEMBRANCE OF A KNOWLEDGE THAT IS ALREADY EMBEDDED IN HUMAN BEINGS MY GUEST FATEMEH KESHAVARZ FINDS RESONANCE IN RUMI FOR THE DEEPEST CHALLENGES BEFORE THE WORLD AND ISLAM TODAY
POD0000001328_S0000340 I DON'T SEE RUMI AS DETACHED FROM THE ISLAMIC CONTEXT AT ALL IN FACT I SEE HIS WORK AS UTTERLY AND COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN THE ISLAMIC TRADITION
POD0000001328_S0000347 HE CHANGES A LOT OF THINGS REINTERPRETS A LOT OF THINGS
POD0000001328_S0000360 AND WE ARE
POD0000001328_S0000375 YOU CAN NEVER SEE THE BROADER VISION
POD0000001328_S0000383 THIS IS WHAT YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT BUT NOW LOOK ONE STEP BEYOND AND HE CAN DO THAT PRECISELY BECAUSE HE'S ROOTED IN THE TRADITION AND I THINK IT'S TRUE ALSO THAT AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT RUMI WAS ENTERING POPULAR IMAGINATIONS BY WAY OF POETRY
POD0000001328_S0000394 HAS BEEN REDUCED SOME SAY TO MERE ENTERTAINMENT I ASKED FATEMEH KESHAVARZ ABOUT RUMI'S LEGACY IN IRAN WHERE SHE GREW UP
POD0000001328_S0000407 I MEAN I HEAR IN MY CONVERSATIONS THAT ISLAM IN IRAN IS THERE'S
POD0000001328_S0000419 NOW WE TALK OF LANGUAGE AS BEING CONSTITUTIVE OF EXPERIENCE BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID
POD0000001328_S0000432 ALLUSIONS

POD0000001336_S0000007 THIS HOUR WE EXPLORE WHAT THAT DECLARATION MEANT AND HOW IT HAS EVOLVED IN ELIE WIESEL'S LIFE AND HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THE WORLD
POD0000001336_S0000016 WIESEL HAS SAID THAT NIGHT IS THE TEXT ON WHICH ALL OF HIS LATER WRITING IS JUST COMMENTARY
POD0000001336_S0000023 BOTH APPEAL TO WHAT IS MOST PERSONAL AND MOST TRANSCENDENT IN A HUMAN BEING
POD0000001336_S0000032 IF ONE MAY ASSUME THAT MAN COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT LITERATURE
POD0000001336_S0000040 ELIE WIESEL LIKES TO CITE A PASSAGE OF THE TALMUD THAT SAYS
POD0000001336_S0000054 I CHANGED MEANING NOT IN DEPTH
POD0000001336_S0000063 SO WHATEVER I SAY IT'S ALWAYS FROM INSIDE FAITH
POD0000001336_S0000076 SINCE YOU SAID THESE WORDS
POD0000001336_S0000084 HE NEVER WROTE ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST IN THOSE TIMES THE GREAT WRITERS ALL AVOIDED THE SUBJECT
POD0000001336_S0000090 NEVER SHALL I FORGET THAT SMOKE
POD0000001336_S0000097 I WENT ON PRAYING
POD0000001336_S0000108 IT'S EXTRAORDINARY

POD0000001336_S0000163 BUT LEARNED THAT THERE ARE A THOUSAND WAYS OF DYING
POD0000001336_S0000170 WHERE WAS GOD
POD0000001336_S0000180 THAT HE IS WITH THE SUFFERER I ACCEPT
POD0000001336_S0000188 BUT ONE MUST ASK THE QUESTION
POD0000001336_S0000197 AND
POD0000001336_S0000207 MURDER WILL BE NOT OUR PROFESSION
POD0000001336_S0000212 A PASSAGE FROM ELIE WIESEL'S NOVEL DAWN
POD0000001336_S0000227 THE AGONY
POD0000001336_S0000237 GOD DIDN'T TELL THEM TO KILL
POD0000001336_S0000247 JUST TO KILL
POD0000001336_S0000259 IT IS THE TURNING HIS FACE AWAY
POD0000001336_S0000268 WHICH HE WANTED NOT PERFECT BUT BEAUTIFUL
POD0000001336_S0000280 UPROOTED
POD0000001336_S0000288 BUT I SAY IN TRUTH
POD0000001336_S0000296 BUT I CANNOT HELP TERRORISTS
POD0000001336_S0000303 IT'S DESPAIR
POD0000001336_S0000314 I FELT WELL
POD0000001336_S0000330 HIS POSSESSIONS AND EVEN HIS ARGUMENT WITH GOD STILL FOUND THE STRENGTH TO BEGIN AGAIN
POD0000001336_S0000336 OUR CONTEMPORARY
POD0000001336_S0000341 HE DEMONSTRATED THAT FAITH IS ESSENTIAL TO REBELLION
POD0000001336_S0000349 I HAVE THE DUTY TO REJECT DESPAIR

POD0000001336_S0000388 NO COUNTRY CAN GIVE IN TO TERROR
POD0000001336_S0000403 THE FIRST AFTER THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
POD0000001336_S0000413 I FEEL THAT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR AMERICANS TO REALLY HAVE A SENSE MAYBE NOT FOR AMERICAN JEWS BUT FOR OTHER AMERICANS TO HAVE A SENSE OF THE SPIRITUAL CONNECTION TO THAT LAND
POD0000001336_S0000423 AND WHEN I CAME TO JERUSALEM FOR THE FIRST TIME
POD0000001336_S0000428 IT'S THE ONLY CITY IN THE WORLD THAT I FEEL THAT WAY
POD0000001336_S0000440 AND BECAUSE
POD0000001336_S0000452 AS FOR ME
POD0000001336_S0000459 THE MOUNT OF OLIVES
POD0000001336_S0000466 LET ANYONE OTHER THAN THE MESSIAH TRY TO PASS AND THE EARTH WILL SHAKE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
POD0000001336_S0000476 THAT THE FIRST BELIEVER ERECTED AN ALTAR ON WHICH TO MAKE AN OFFERING OF BOTH HIS PAST AND HIS FUTURE
POD0000001336_S0000486 AS I WATCHED WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN SOUTH AFRICA HOW IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF THERE HAD BEEN SOME PROCESS LIKE THAT
POD0000001336_S0000495 THEN
POD0000001336_S0000505 AND SAID NELSON
POD0000001336_S0000516 I HAD NEVER BEFORE CONSIDERED THAT IT COULD BE AS PAINFUL TO BE THE CHILDREN OF THOSE WHO RAN THE CAMPS AS TO BE THE CHILD OF THOSE WHO DIED IN THEM

POD0000001336_S0000554 AND WE PLEAD WE CALL FOR FORGIVENESS

POD0000001344_S0000299 JUST NATURALLY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO LEARN IT
POD0000001344_S0000308 AND CARVER'S LIFE SHOWED THAT CAPACITY
POD0000001344_S0000316 SERVED FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS UNDER SEVERAL DIFFERENT MASTERS IN CONNECTICUT RHODE ISLAND
POD0000001344_S0000324 I HAD SPUN MONEY OUT OF SWEAT

POD0000001344_S0000367 LAST YEAR OR MAYBE THE YEAR BEFORE
POD0000001344_S0000377 SOMEWHERE YOU SAID
POD0000001344_S0000391 AND THE FIRST CHURCH
POD0000001344_S0000399 THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AFTER ITS FOUNDING
POD0000001344_S0000410 HOW DO WE BRING IT INTO THE WORLD

POD0000001352_S0000008 SO YOU JUST REALIZE THAT WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS SIMPLY THE SEEDING OF THE QUESTION
POD0000001352_S0000021 AS A YOUNG NUN FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS SHE WORE A HABIT
POD0000001352_S0000033 OVER THE YEARS JOAN CHITTISTER HAS INCREASINGLY ENGAGED WITH OTHER FAITHS
POD0000001352_S0000040 BUT JOAN CHITTISTER'S FUTURE THEOLOGY WAS DEEPLY SHAPED BY THE FACT OF HER PARENTS' THEN-SCANDALOUS MIXED MARRIAGE
POD0000001352_S0000045 I LEARNED THERE WAS THE WORD OF SCRIPTURE
POD0000001352_S0000052 THAT HOLINESS
POD0000001352_S0000064 THAT NONE OF MY CHITTISTER RELATIVES WERE GOING TO HEAVEN
POD0000001352_S0000071 WELL HONEY WHAT DID YOU LEARN IN SCHOOL TODAY WHAT HAPPENED IN SCHOOL TODAY
POD0000001352_S0000077 AND SHE SAID YOU DO YOU THINK THAT'S WRONG
POD0000001352_S0000085 WHAT DID YOU SAY TO SISTER
POD0000001352_S0000091 SINCE THAT DAY IN SECOND GRADE
POD0000001352_S0000097 JOAN CHITTISTER WAS CAPTIVATED BY THE VERY IDEA OF MONASTIC WOMEN WHEN SHE WAS THREE YEARS OLD
POD0000001352_S0000107 WHAT IS THAT THING
POD0000001352_S0000115 THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING TO DO IN LIFE
POD0000001352_S0000129 IT'S A HAPPY LIFE
POD0000001352_S0000137 OF RELATIONSHIPS
POD0000001352_S0000145 WHY BECAUSE SHE COMES INTO THE FULLNESS OF HERSELF AND SPENDS HER LIFE CONCENTRATING ON THE FULLNESS OF HERSELF BUT NOT FOR HER OWN PURPOSE ALONE
POD0000001352_S0000154 BUT YOUR LIFE IS ALSO VERY MUCH A LIFE OF ACTION IS THERE A TENSION IN THAT OR HOW DO THOSE TWO THINGS WORK TOGETHER
POD0000001352_S0000159 THEY LEAVE THEIR HOUSES OPEN
POD0000001352_S0000164 RESPOND THE BEST YOU AND YOUR COMMUNITY CAN
POD0000001352_S0000170 THE WORLD IS COMING IN
POD0000001352_S0000176 IF I WEREN'T IMMERSED IN MY COMMUNITY
POD0000001352_S0000181 WE SAY EVERYBODY IS WELCOME HERE
POD0000001352_S0000189 WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR YOU TO LIVE BY THAT RULE OF BENEDICT
POD0000001352_S0000197 WE'RE NOT A WORK WE'RE NOT AN INSTITUTION
POD0000001352_S0000203 DO YOUR OWN WORK SUPPORT YOURSELF DON'T EXPECT ANYBODY ELSE TO SUPPORT THIS MONASTERY THE RULE SAYS WE EARN OUR BREAD BY THE SWEAT OF OUR BROW JUST AS OUR AS THE ANCIENTS BEFORE US
POD0000001352_S0000209 THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO WORK ON TODAY
POD0000001352_S0000218 AND WOMEN WERE EXPECTED TO CONFORM
POD0000001352_S0000226 LISTEN TO THEM
POD0000001352_S0000231 WHICH IS ABOUT CONFORMITY
POD0000001352_S0000239 TO BE OTHER THAN YOU CAN BE IS NO SIGN OF GREAT SPIRITUAL VALOR
POD0000001352_S0000247 SHE CITED HER BENEDICTINE UNDERSTANDING OF OBEDIENCE
POD0000001352_S0000254 ASKED HOW POWER COULD BE REDISTRIBUTED AND HELPED TO SHAPE AN ECONOMIC WORLD WHERE WORKERS HAD THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE
POD0000001352_S0000260 ABOUT RECLAIMING THE COSMIC VISION
POD0000001352_S0000276 I WONDER IF YOU'D TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW THAT CAME TO BE A PART OF YOUR PASSION YOU KNOW AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MIGHT FIND THIS DESCRIPTION TO BE A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS TO BE A ROMAN CATHOLIC FEMINIST RELIGIOUS
POD0000001352_S0000286 MAMA WHAT'S A FEMINIST
POD0000001352_S0000292 ABOUT THE WORLD BEING A BETTER PLACE IF WE WERE USING ALL THE GIFTS OF THE HUMAN RACE INSTEAD OF JUST HALF OF THEM
POD0000001352_S0000305 I KNOW THAT WITHIN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
POD0000001352_S0000313 A CATHOLIC AUTHORITY WRITING ABOUT YOUR IDEAS WAS YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT IS PUT FORWARD NOT JUST IN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
POD0000001352_S0000323 AND EVERY INSTITUTION ON EARTH IS BEGINNING TO HONOR THOSE EXPECTATIONS EXCEPT ONE
POD0000001352_S0000333 IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR IDEAS TO SEEP TO THE TOP
POD0000001352_S0000340 HOW MANY WOMEN'S VOICES WILL IT TAKE BEFORE WE HONOR THE WOMAN'S QUESTION I DON'T KNOW
POD0000001352_S0000347 IN RECENT YEARS THE VATICAN HAS GROWN LESS EMBRACING IN SOME OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
POD0000001352_S0000355 THE HEART OF NONE OF THE GREAT RELIGIONS REALLY SUPPORTS ENDORSES OR SETS OUT TO PRODUCE WAR OR KILLING OR DEATH FOR ANYONE
POD0000001352_S0000360 WHO THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE
POD0000001352_S0000367 IMMERSED IN YOUR OWN THE BEST OF YOUR OWN SPIRITUAL TRADITION
POD0000001352_S0000372 WE ARE ALL MOVING TOWARD THAT GOD WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS AND WITH ALL OF THE GIFTS THAT EACH OF THESE GREAT SEEKING TRADITIONS GIVES US IN OUR CULTURE
POD0000001352_S0000377 THAT I FEEL THAT PRESENCE
POD0000001352_S0000385 AND I HAVE DONE IT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED AND OFTEN DISTORTED IMAGE OF THE VOICE OF RELIGION IN OUR OWN CULTURE AND OUR OWN TIME
POD0000001352_S0000393 AND HAVE THAT BABY TREATED OR NOT
POD0000001352_S0000398 IT GETS OUR MINDS OFF OF THE SINS THAT ARE REALLY KILLING THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE
POD0000001352_S0000403 IT'S EASY TO GET A BABY BORN WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS ONCE THAT BABY IS BORN WILL YOU FEED IT AND HOUSE IT AND EDUCATE IT
POD0000001352_S0000408 YOU USED A PHRASE WITH ME WHICH I'VE QUOTED MANY TIMES AND YOU SAID A LOT OF PEOPLE THESE DAYS ARE GETTING THEIR RELIGION OFF THE SHELVES OUT OF BOOKS
POD0000001352_S0000416 THE OLD ANSWERS DON'T SUFFICE AND IF THEY SUFFICE THEY DON'T SATISFY
POD0000001352_S0000421 ONCE WE CLONED A SHEEP
POD0000001352_S0000426 CAN WE GET VALUES FROM OUR CHURCHES OF COURSE WE CAN AND WE DO
POD0000001352_S0000432 DOES ANYBODY WANT TO KNOW SO WHERE DO I GO IF I CAN'T GET IT IN A PULPIT
POD0000001352_S0000445 THERE ARE IN EVERY SINGLE CULTURE AND IN EVERY GREAT RELIGIOUS REVELATION IN EVERY CONTINENT OF THE WORLD
POD0000001352_S0000458 THAT MUST MEAN THEN
POD0000001352_S0000464 HERE IN CLOSING IS A STORY SHE TELLS ABOUT HER VISION FOR THE FUTURE
POD0000001352_S0000471 THOSE MAPS WENT UNCHANGED BECAUSE SOMEONE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH PARTIAL INFORMATION
POD0000001352_S0000476 BEGAN TO ISSUE A NEW VERSION
POD0000001360_S0000013 BUT SHE'S ALSO WRITTEN OVER THE YEARS ABOUT HOW SHE HAS COME BACK TO REALLY RICHLY INTEGRATE THAT WITH HER JEWISH IDENTITY
POD0000001360_S0000020 AND I FIND THAT WHEN PEOPLE SAY WHAT ARE YOU PROUDEST OF IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE
POD0000001360_S0000030 BUT THEY ARE I THINK
POD0000001360_S0000053 BUT WHEN I WAS A CHILD I WORRIED ABOUT IT A LOT
POD0000001360_S0000066 FRETTING ARISES IN MY MIND AND IT'S NOT A MORAL FLAW
POD0000001360_S0000086 WHILE I WAS AT SEMINARY WHILE I WAS STUDYING THEOLOGY WHICH WAS A REALLY INTERESTING THING TO DO
POD0000001360_S0000110 BUT IF I THINK ABOUT THAT ENOUGH OF THE TIME
POD0000001360_S0000128 I ACTUALLY NEVER LEFT I HAD ALWAYS A VERY CORDIAL AND WARM RELATIONSHIP TO JUDAISM
POD0000001360_S0000149 TREMENDOUS ENERGY
POD0000001360_S0000164 AND NOW SHE'S AWAKENED
POD0000001360_S0000186 AM I PLEASED
POD0000001360_S0000204 BUT IN THE LARGER SENSE
POD0000001360_S0000214 HEARING ME TEACH ABOUT TRANSFORMING ANGER INTO
POD0000001360_S0000226 WHICH IS BASIC
POD0000001360_S0000247 AND OUT
POD0000001360_S0000255 A BLESSING FOR YOURSELF
POD0000001360_S0000261 MAY I FEEL CONTENT
POD0000001360_S0000267 ALL PEOPLE JUST LIKE US
POD0000001360_S0000273 WISH FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE
POD0000001360_S0000278 MAY YOU LIVE WITH EASE
POD0000001360_S0000290 AND KINDNESS IS MUCH MORE HUMBLE
POD0000001360_S0000298 YOU CAN BE A LIFETIME CULTIVATING THOSE THINGS YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE KIND TO SOMEONE EVEN IF YOU DON'T FEEL ESPECIALLY COMPASSIONATE
POD0000001360_S0000311 THEN I DON'T REALLY MESS UP MY OWN MIND
POD0000001360_S0000323 ABOUT THIS KIND OF
POD0000001360_S0000336 I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE GPS IN MY CAR
POD0000001360_S0000359 CHILDREN HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE KIND
POD0000001360_S0000369 THERE'S A VERSION OF THAT THAT GOES THROUGH MY MIND
POD0000001360_S0000380 SINCE FOR MYSELF
POD0000001360_S0000391 PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE THAT THEY DON'T KNOW
POD0000001360_S0000400 SO THAT HERE WE ARE AGAIN AT ANOTHER TIME IN ANOTHER SEASON
POD0000001360_S0000409 THEN THEY BEGIN TO THINK OH IT'S MY FAVORITE MOON A THREE-DAY
POD0000001360_S0000420 HER AUTOMATIC SIGNATURE SAYS STAY AMAZED
POD0000001360_S0000439 WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY THERE
POD0000001360_S0000450 AND WHAT I UNDERSTOOD FROM HIM IS THAT HE DIDN'T LEARN THE WORDS OF THE PRAYER HE LEARNED THE FEELINGS OUT OF HER BODY AS SHE SAT THERE
POD0000001360_S0000473 RELAX
POD0000001360_S0000486 THIS IS CALLED KEEPING QUIET
POD0000001360_S0000491 WITHOUT ENGINES WE WOULD ALL BE TOGETHER IN A SUDDEN STRANGENESS
POD0000001360_S0000496 VICTORIES WITH NO SURVIVORS
POD0000001360_S0000502 AND FOR ONCE COULD DO NOTHING
POD0000001360_S0000513 HELPING TO BUILD THE SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION FOR A LOVING WORLD
POD0000001368_S0000005 SHE'S EMERGED AS ONE OF OUR GREAT CHRONICLERS OF UNTOLD HISTORIES OF REDEMPTIVE CHANGE IN PLACES LIKE POST-HURRICANE KATRINA NEW ORLEANS
POD0000001368_S0000010 I WANT BETTER METAPHORS I WANT BETTER STORIES
POD0000001368_S0000017 SHE WAS BORN IN BRIDGEPORT CONNECTICUT AND MOVED WITH HER PARENTS TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG
POD0000001368_S0000029 AND SO THAT WAS IF YOU WENT NORTH EVEN JUST TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE AND BEYOND
POD0000001368_S0000043 EVEN THOUGH THE LIST OF MONSTROUS ICE-HEARTED MOTHERS IS EXTENSIVE
POD0000001368_S0000055 SO
POD0000001368_S0000069 NEW ORLEANS ON AUGUST TWENTY NINE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE BECAUSE THAT'S WHY IT WAS THE CITY WAS SHUT OFF TURNED INTO A PRISON CITY WHY THE POLICE WERE SHOOTING BLACK PEOPLE IN THE BACK
POD0000001368_S0000077 THE IMPACT OF OCCUPY WALL STREET
POD0000001368_S0000093 WHY HAS EVERYTHING WE'VE EVER BEEN TOLD ABOUT HUMAN NATURE MISLED US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE MOMENTS AND WHAT HAPPENS IF WE ACKNOWLEDGE
POD0000001368_S0000110 AND SHE'S SO INTERESTING AS SOMEBODY WHO RENOUNCES IT DIRECTLY AND CONNECTS THIS OTHER SENSE SO DIRECTLY TO DISASTER
POD0000001368_S0000120 I WOULD SAY THE REASONABLENESS OF HOPE AND THE REALITY OF DARKNESS
POD0000001368_S0000142 IT TERRIFIED
POD0000001368_S0000151 I'M KRISTA TIPPETT AND THIS IS ON BEING
POD0000001368_S0000165 AND INTO ELECTORAL POLITICS
POD0000001368_S0000172 IF YOU MET SOMEONE
POD0000001368_S0000190 THEN THINGS HAPPEN LIKE THEY BASICALLY GET SEALED OFF YOU CAN WALK OUT OF THE CENTRAL CITY TO DRY LAND BUT THE
POD0000001368_S0000215 AND THAT'S THE KIND OF INDIRECT CONSEQUENCES THAT I FIND SO INTERESTING TO TRACE IS THAT HERE'S SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT OF KATRINA THAT'S STILL HELPING PEOPLE EVERY DAY RIGHT
POD0000001368_S0000227 SO ALL THESE THINGS ARE PART OF THE PLACE AND
POD0000001368_S0000233 IN A CITY THAT'S PARTLY BELOW SEA LEVEL
POD0000001368_S0000249 AND YOU WROTE TRACE IT FAR ENOUGH AND THIS VERY MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE BECOMES A RARE SPECIES THE RESULT OF A STRANGE EVOLUTION
POD0000001368_S0000264 THEY COUNT
POD0000001368_S0000281 NOT JUST HAVE THAT AMAZING MOMENT IN THE STREETS AND THAT RUPTURE BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ONGOING ENGAGEMENT WITH TRANSFORMING THE SYSTEM AND MAKING IT ACCOUNTABLE
POD0000001368_S0000291 GIVE US TOOLS THAT ARE
POD0000001368_S0000331 THE INTELLIGENCE THE PASSION
POD0000001368_S0000341 WEAKNESS BECAUSE IT'S VULNERABLE BUT IT TAKES STRENGTH TO ENTER INTO THAT VULNERABILITY OF BEING OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITIES
POD0000001368_S0000360 IT'S ALL JUST THIS KIND OF ASTONISHMENT
POD0000001368_S0000372 SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS AND INITIATIVES THAT UPHOLD A SACRED RELATIONSHIP WITH LIFE ON EARTH
POD0000001376_S0000015 SHE IS A UNIVERSITY DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR IN THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT AT VIRGINIA TECH
POD0000001376_S0000051 FIRST OF ALL I GREW UP OF COURSE
POD0000001376_S0000064 HAVING A BABY HURTS
POD0000001376_S0000075 SO SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER THEY HAD TO MAKE A DECISION HOW DO WE GO FORWARD
POD0000001376_S0000081 THESE PEOPLE HAD CREATED A WAY TO SPEAK TO THEMSELVES TO EACH OTHER
POD0000001376_S0000093 WELL A PART OF WHAT I'M DOING IS ARTICULATING I WOULD BE IF I WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH IF I CAN SAY IT LIKE THAT
POD0000001376_S0000115 BUT I AM SMART
POD0000001376_S0000131 AND IT'S GONNA SAY HOKIES DON'T HATE
POD0000001376_S0000148 AND WE ARE USED TO LOOKING AT THE STARS IN MY OPINION LOOKING AT THE STARS DREAMING
POD0000001376_S0000157 AND WHAT SHE SAID
POD0000001376_S0000177 HATRED WAS A BAD IDEA
POD0000001376_S0000190 HANGING IN A VOID SHIELDED AND NOURISHED BY A PAPER-THIN ATMOSPHERE FROM SPACE NATIONAL BOUNDARIES VANISH THE CONFLICTS THAT DIVIDE PEOPLE BECOME LESS IMPORTANT
POD0000001376_S0000205 WE ARE NOT MOVING ON WE ARE EMBRACING OUR MOURNING WE ARE VIRGINIA TECH WE ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO STAND TALL TEARLESSLY WE ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO BEND TO CRY
POD0000001376_S0000219 WE ARE SAD TODAY
POD0000001376_S0000226 WE KNOW WE DID NOTHING TO DESERVE IT
POD0000001376_S0000237 WE ARE BETTER THAN WE THINK AND NOT QUITE WHAT WE WANT TO BE
POD0000001376_S0000253 YOU'RE ALWAYS DOING THE BEST THAT YOU CAN DO
POD0000001376_S0000270 NOT TO MENTION WASTE WHAT THEY FEEL
POD0000001376_S0000287 BUT THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO BACK

POD0000001400_S0000065 THE PERFECT HASBARA STORY AND I REALLY DON'T MEAN THIS SARCASTICALLY PLAYS UP ISRAEL'S INNOVATION OPENNESS AND HUMANITARIANISM
POD0000001400_S0000071 AND SOMETIMES LIKE IN THE PIECE WE'RE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM SAMUEL THROPE
POD0000001400_S0000080 BUT ISRAEL AND IRAN

POD0000001400_S0000164 HE WANTED TO ESCAPE THE LONELINESS AND ISOLATION OF HIS EVERYDAY LIFE
POD0000001400_S0000178 AND WHEN PAYAM FIRST SENT HER A COPY OF FIGS

POD0000001400_S0000335 AND I'M NOT SURE WHETHER PAYAM REALIZED THE MAGNITUDE AND THE GRAVITY OF THE DECISION HE WAS TAKING PAYAM IS FRUSTRATED
POD0000001400_S0000344 AFTER ALL HE HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO GO ELSEWHERE TO AMERICA
POD0000001400_S0000349 AS ODD AS IT SEEMS TO SAY IT

POD0000001416_S0000119 WITH ESTHER'S HELP JORDAN MADE RAPID PROGRESS
POD0000001416_S0000137 BUT THEN
POD0000001416_S0000143 ESTHER HAD KEPT UP WITH OTHER PATIENTS AS WELL
POD0000001416_S0000153 SOON THEY BECAME FRIENDS
POD0000001416_S0000162 AND ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE JORDAN DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IF ESTHER WAS INTERESTED IN WOMEN

POD0000001416_S0000185 JORDAN COULDN'T TELL FOR SURE
POD0000001416_S0000190 IF I DON'T SAY THIS I NEVER WILL AND THAT'S NOT BEING HONEST AND I'M SURE OF MYSELF I FEEL IT IN MY STOMACH SO SHE SAT DOWN AND WROTE A LOVE POEM TO ESTHER IT'S SUPER CHEESY
POD0000001416_S0000196 AND RECEIVING JORDAN'S POEM MADE HER CONCERNED SHE COULD LOVE ME BECAUSE
POD0000001416_S0000205 I FELT VERY VERY RESPONSIBLE VERY GUILTY
POD0000001416_S0000214 BECAUSE I HAD MY GUT FEELING TELLING ME THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO PURSUE THAT THIS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR YOU
POD0000001416_S0000223 A FRIENDSHIP ESTHER DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE UP
POD0000001416_S0000239 A PLACE WHERE WE TALK TO OUR FANS

POD0000001416_S0000306 IT WAS MORE GRADUAL
POD0000001416_S0000322 ESTHER DOUBTED THEY WOULD HAVE ANY FUTURE IT DOESN'T WORK
POD0000001416_S0000328 AND WHILE SHE HAD OFTEN PUSHED AGAINST THEM THERE WAS A LIMIT
POD0000001416_S0000336 BACK IN THE STATES JORDAN BEGAN TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT HER NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH MIXED REACTIONS

POD0000002074_S0000013 THEY LEARNED SOMEWHERE BACK IN SOME ECONOMICS COURSE THAT INFLATION IS CAUSED BY TOO MUCH MONEY CHASING TOO FEW GOODS
POD0000002074_S0000020 AND ARGUABLY IT HELPED
POD0000002083_S0000017 AND THAT RULING MAY BE NARROWLY FOCUSED BETWEEN COMCAST AND THE FCC
POD0000002083_S0000029 SO THEY'VE BEEN ARGUING THAT QUITE A BIT BUT CONSUMER PROTECTION GROUPS WOULD SAY IF YOU DON'T HAVE SORT OF A COP ON THE BEAT
POD0000002093_S0000051 WHEN IS THIS GOING TO END WHEN IS IT GOING TO START GETTING BETTER BECAUSE IT JUST WASN'T AND YOU WENT INTO THIS FUNDRAISER RIGHT INTO THE COAT CLOSET

POD0000002569_S0000043 YOU TAKE THIS SAUCE AND USE IT TO DRESS UP WHATEVER YOU'RE COOKING
POD0000002585_S0000033 AND ONE REASON FOR THAT IS IT CAN DO WHAT WE CALL THE BREAK

POD0000002625_S0000035 THE FANCY DINING ROOM TABLE DIDN'T GET USED EVERY DAY BUT THIS ONE DID

POD0000002795_S0000080 HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT POLITICS
POD0000002812_S0000035 IT'S ALL CASH
POD0000002820_S0000035 WE CAN THEN LEARN TO RESPECT THEM
POD0000002836_S0000049 THIS IS HOW YOU SPREAD THE CUISINE
POD0000002844_S0000025 AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT IN YOUR HISTORY THERE ARE DEFINITELY FISH THAT BECOME EXTREMELY POPULAR THROUGH THE YEARS
POD0000002844_S0000054 THAT'S NOT TO SAY THEY'RE NOT WORTH EATING
POD0000002856_S0000048 AND I'M AN ONION FANATIC

POD0000002911_S0000074 CAN ACTUALLY
POD0000002927_S0000009 FOR HOW LONG THAT'S STILL KIND OF UP IN THE AIR BECAUSE LEGAL BATTLES ARE PLAYING OUT IN THE COURTS
POD0000002927_S0000015 AND SHE WAS PLANNING AN EAST COAST TRIP TO VISIT COLLEGES WHEN WE FIRST MET SO ABIGAIL WAS ABOUT TO TRAVEL CROSS-COUNTRY WITHOUT ANY U S DOCUMENTATION
POD0000002927_S0000028 SHE'S WAY MORE CONCERNED WITH BEING REJECTED FROM PRINCETON HER DREAM SCHOOL
POD0000002927_S0000038 SO IT WAS ALWAYS LIKE
POD0000002927_S0000047 MIRIAM WAS NUMBER ONE IN HER CLASS AND DETERMINED TO GO TO COLLEGE
POD0000002927_S0000060 BUT REMEMBER ABIGAIL DOESN'T HAVE DACA SO EVEN IF SHE GOT INTO ALL THOSE EXPENSIVE SCHOOLS THEY VISITED
POD0000002927_S0000068 SHE MOSTLY THOUGHT OF DACA AS SOMETHING THAT LET YOU WORK DEPORTATION HAS NEVER REALLY BEEN TOP OF MIND FOR THE GONZALEZ SISTERS UNTIL RECENTLY
POD0000002927_S0000073 ONCE ABIGAIL FINALLY DECIDED IT WAS TIME MIRIAM TALKED TO A LAWYER WHO SAID HOLD OFF
POD0000002927_S0000081 A DREAMER WITHOUT DACA
POD0000002927_S0000092 ELEVEN LETTERS THAT'S A VERY LONG NAME
POD0000002927_S0000100 HE NEVER WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL

POD0000002927_S0000118 HE KNOWS
POD0000002927_S0000127 SOMETHING HE FORGOT TO SAY THAT ACTUALLY WAS ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION AND HIS OLDEST SISTER OK
POD0000002927_S0000142 ABIGAIL'S NEVER ASKED JOSEVENTURA IF HE RESENTS BEING THE ONLY ONE WITH U S CITIZENSHIP
POD0000002935_S0000016 AND SHEREEN CONTAINS MULTITUDES GUESS WHAT I AM
POD0000002935_S0000034 AND SHE ALSO FOUND THAT WHITE AMERICANS AND BLACK AMERICANS TEND TO HAVE THE FEWEST CROSS-RACIAL FRIENDSHIPS
POD0000002935_S0000045 WHITE GIRLS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE FRIENDS
POD0000002935_S0000053 WELL GRACE IS A QUANTITATIVE RESEARCHER SHE'S THE PERSON WHO SAYS
POD0000002935_S0000060 OR YOU CAN STUDY NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND YOU CAN'T TALK TO ANY OF THEM SO UNLIKE GRACE I AM A QUALITATIVE RESEARCHER THAT'S BEVERLY DANIEL TATUM
POD0000002935_S0000071 RIGHT JUST A HUNCH
POD0000002935_S0000076 SHE'S AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT ASSUMPTION COLLEGE AND SHE TEACHES PROSPECTIVE EDUCATORS AND THERAPISTS
POD0000002935_S0000083 THEY'RE STILL BEING DIVVIED UP BY RACE BECAUSE OF TRACKING
POD0000002935_S0000092 BUT BARRING THAT GENE
POD0000002935_S0000111 AND THAT'S WHERE SHE SAYS THINGS CAN GET CHALLENGING
POD0000002935_S0000119 YOU MAY HAVE A POINT
POD0000002935_S0000125 THAT IS A PROTECTIVE RESPONSE
POD0000002935_S0000131 LIKE THEIR SPACE FOR WHITENESS YEAH
POD0000002935_S0000138 THEY WERE REAL FRIENDS THEY HUNG OUT OUTSIDE OF WORK
POD0000002935_S0000150 MEANWHILE THE WHITE STUDENTS DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT RACE THEY JUST WANTED TO HANG OUT
POD0000002935_S0000166 GENE SHEREEN CODE SWITCH OK SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FRIENDSHIP ON THIS EPISODE AND SHEREEN
POD0000002935_S0000184 AND SO AMY'S FRIEND CIRCLES WHICH ARE MOSTLY WHITE
POD0000002935_S0000196 IS THE COLLEGE THAT SHE GOES TO SUPER WHITE
POD0000002935_S0000202 IN FACT SHE TALKED TO SOME OTHER STUDENTS OF COLOR ABOUT HOW SHE WAS FEELING ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF ANOTHER ASIAN GIRL WHO GREW UP IN SUBURBAN MINNESOTA A SUBURB
POD0000002935_S0000208 RIGHT AND ALSO WE JUST WANT TO SAY TO AMY LIKE
POD0000002935_S0000216 CO-AUTHORED WITH MY DEAR FRIEND
POD0000002935_S0000230 FOR HIM PATHOLOGICAL AND IT'S A MOURNING WITHOUT END AND SO TWO DECADES AGO
POD0000002935_S0000242 AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY SHE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE MANY FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO WERE ASIAN AMERICAN
POD0000002935_S0000253 DAVID SAID THAT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AMY IS GOING THROUGH SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE TO ZOOM OUT TO THE LARGER CONTEXT OF ASIAN AMERICAN FOLKS IN AMERICAN LIFE
POD0000002935_S0000258 THAT IS A LONG LONG HISTORY AND REAL QUICK DAVID POINTED OUT THAT THE DOCTRINE OF COLORBLINDNESS THAT YOU KNOW RACE DOESN'T MATTER THAT WE SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT BLAH BLAH BLAH THAT REALLY SET IN IN THE NINETEEN NINETY S ABOUT A GENERATION OR SO OUT FROM THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT RIGHT
POD0000002935_S0000269 SHE'S IN A PLACE WITH A CRITICAL MASS OF PEOPLE OF COLOR DAVID POINTED OUT THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN HOMOGENOUS SPACES AND THEN GO TO REASONABLY DIVERSE COLLEGES DON'T SUDDENLY HAVE DIVERSE FRIENDSHIPS AFTER COLLEGE RIGHT
POD0000002935_S0000276 DEFINITELY RIGHT BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T KNOW ANY OF THIS HISTORY AND IF THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF RACE IN AMERICA
POD0000002935_S0000284 NOT JUST TO UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN LIFE EXPERIENCES BUT HOW TO CONTEXTUALIZE THOSE LIFE EXPERIENCES INTO A MUCH LONGER HISTORY
POD0000002935_S0000298 OK SO THIS LETTER CAME FROM A WOMAN NAMED SARAH IN NEW YORK DEAR CODE SWITCH I ONCE HAD A CO-WORKER WHO QUICKLY BECAME A FRIEND OUTSIDE OF WORK
POD0000002935_S0000304 AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE BOTH DEALING WITH IS THIS MANAGER AT WORK WHO SARAH DESCRIBED AS BEING ABUSIVE HE TARGETED WOMEN OF COLOR
POD0000002935_S0000309 WHEREAS HE DOUBLED DOWN ON TREATING MY CO-WORKER HORRIBLY UH-OH YEAH
POD0000002935_S0000317 SHE DECLINED TO COME TO MY WEDDING AND I NEVER SUCCEEDED IN CONVINCING HER THAT I WASN'T A TRAITOR TO THE RACE
POD0000002935_S0000322 I HOPE THIS STORY RESONATES WITH SOMEONE
POD0000002935_S0000330 SHE ALSO CURATES A DIRECTORY OF THERAPISTS IN THE U S AND CANADA WHO SHE SAYS DO GREAT CLINICAL WORK WITH BLACK WOMEN AND GIRLS
POD0000002935_S0000345 SHE COULD BE RIGHT OR LIKE SHE WAS LIKE
POD0000002935_S0000352 SUCKING UP TO THE PLANTATION OWNER
POD0000002935_S0000358 THAT'S ACCORDING TO A WOMAN NAMED JEFFRIANNE WILDER WHO'S STUDIED COLORISM FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS
POD0000002935_S0000367 AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE REALLY STRESSED THEY DON'T ALWAYS ACT IN EXACTLY THE WAYS THAT THEY WOULD BE MOST PROUD OF SO LEAH DO THESE TWO GO ANYWHERE FROM HERE I MEAN IS THERE A WAY TO SALVAGE THIS RELATIONSHIP
POD0000002935_S0000376 OK WELL I CAN APOLOGIZE AND TRY TO MAKE THIS THING BETTER AND THEN WE CAN KIND OF PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF IN THE FRIENDSHIP
POD0000002935_S0000389 AND SHE SAID SHE DID GIVE HERSELF TIME TO GRIEVE ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF
POD0000002935_S0000414 I'M SHEREEN MARISOL MERAJI AND I'M GENE DEMBY
POD0000002945_S0000018 AND TA-DA
POD0000002945_S0000027 THERE ARE THESE SMALL PERSONAL QUESTIONS AND THAT'S SORT OF THE GENERAL TENOR OF THE QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN GETTING FROM Y'ALL SO THIS WEEK ON THE PODCAST WE THOUGHT WE WOULD TAKE A FEW OF THOSE QUESTIONS ON
POD0000002945_S0000034 WRITE US BACK IF THEY DO SOMETHING AWKWARD OR RACIALLY INSENSITIVE
POD0000002945_S0000042 SO WHAT IS BLACK PEOPLE KNOW RIGHT
POD0000002945_S0000055 I'M A WHITE FEMALE AND HE'S FILIPINO-AMERICAN
POD0000002945_S0000061 CONSIDERED BARBARIC AND HIM WEARING A BARONG
POD0000002945_S0000067 IT'S ABOUT RECOGNIZING AND VALIDATING HIS CULTURE AND TRADITIONS THAT STILL LONG STORY SHORT
POD0000002945_S0000076 AND THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED AND HONORED BUT HERE'S THE STICKY PART
POD0000002945_S0000083 AND YOU'LL HAVE A WAY BETTER CHANCE OF LIVING HAPPILY EVER AFTER AND P S
POD0000002945_S0000097 YOU KNOW IF YOU FEEL THIS STRONGLY ABOUT IT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO PAY FOR ANYTHING WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE WEDDING WE WANT AND ON THAT NOTE IT'S TIME FOR A BREAK WHEN WE COME BACK WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM A WOMAN WHO WORRIES ABOUT GENTRIFYING HER OWN CULTURE

POD0000002945_S0000146 BUT IF YOU GET TO KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE PART OF THE BLOCK CLUB AND YOU YOU'RE HELPING OUT
POD0000002945_S0000157 HERE IT IS MY HUSBAND AND I ARE WHITE AND WE HAVE ONE BIOLOGICAL CHILD A BABY WHO SHARES MANY OF OUR PHYSICAL FEATURES
POD0000002945_S0000163 IN THE END WE SETTLED ON A CONGREGATION THAT IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WHITE
POD0000002945_S0000172 I THINK THAT NOEL AND HER FAMILY HAVE TO GO TO A BLACK CHURCH
POD0000002945_S0000182 I THINK THE SECOND THING IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THESE PARENTS TO FEEL WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE YES
POD0000002945_S0000189 SHE IS ALSO THE WHITE ADOPTIVE MOTHER OF A BLACK SON AND A LATINA DAUGHTER

POD0000002945_S0000213 WHAT THAT'S ALL OK WITH ME
POD0000002945_S0000218 AND RECOGNIZE WHAT IT'S DOING FOR OUR KIDS YEAH IT'S FUNNY LISTENING TO HER SAY THAT BECAUSE LIKE THESE ARE THE THING THAT BLACK PARENTS THINK ABOUT THEIR BLACK CHILDREN ALL THE TIME LIKE HOW CAN I PUT MY SON AND DAUGHTER IN PLACES THAT ARE AFFIRMING IN A WORLD THAT IT WILL NOT GENERALLY BE AFFIRMING TO THEM RIGHT

POD0000002961_S0000070 THAT DR KING OF COURSE IS THE DR KING DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JR RIGHT YUP
POD0000002961_S0000079 WHITE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY

POD0000002969_S0000061 IT WAS NOT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT WAS THE FIRST TO ASK FOR A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION
POD0000002969_S0000070 AM I TO ASSUME THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THE JUDGE IN NEW YORK STRUCK IT DOWN
POD0000002969_S0000086 BUT AFTER MONTHS OF PRESSURE FROM THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT
POD0000002969_S0000095 AND THE CENSUS BUREAU IN FACT
POD0000002969_S0000101 SO THE CENSUS BUREAU MADE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS TO WILBUR ROSS
POD0000002969_S0000106 RIGHT MR GORE THAT
POD0000002969_S0000117 AFTER THE CENSUS BUREAU GOT THIS REQUEST FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION

POD0000002985_S0000110 QUOTE
POD0000002985_S0000119 HE RESPONDED

POD0000002985_S0000168 AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT
POD0000002985_S0000182 AND ALL SPORTS ESPECIALLY OLYMPIC SPORTS
POD0000002985_S0000195 SHE ENDS UP DOING HER OWN KIND OF TOUR THROUGH FORMERLY FRENCH WEST AFRICA AND THIS EXPERIENCE SEEING THE AFTERMATH OF COLONIALISM AND POLITICAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE U S
POD0000002985_S0000218 OF COMMITMENT
POD0000002985_S0000255 HOW DO PEOPLE RESPOND TO THESE NEWS REPORTS
POD0000002985_S0000274 SO MANY PEOPLE PUT HIS STANCE ON HIS RELIGION AND THEY SAID WELL HE USED TO BE CHRIS JACKSON HE CONVERTED TO ISLAM
POD0000002993_S0000016 HE WASN'T HAVING IT
POD0000002993_S0000027 EIGHT SCHOOLS SIX ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS TWO MIDDLE SCHOOLS STAYED OPEN THROUGHOUT THE STRIKE
POD0000002993_S0000050 WOULD HAVE BEEN NO STRIKE
POD0000002993_S0000072 TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE RUN THE CAFETERIA EVERYTHING
POD0000002993_S0000082 AND THEY WERE SAYING LIKE
POD0000002993_S0000093 SUPPOSEDLY THIS WAS TRANSCRIBED FROM LES CAMPBELL'S SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS IT'S WRITTEN LIKE A PLAY SO WE TOOK THIS PIECE OF PROPAGANDA AND WE ASKED SOME ACTORS TO READ IT
POD0000002993_S0000102 TELL HIM WHAT YOU LEARNED WELL
POD0000002993_S0000108 THE FIRST IS POLITICAL POWER
POD0000002993_S0000115 NOW TIMMY
POD0000002993_S0000123 WHERE IS ITALY
POD0000002993_S0000130 IT'S FIGHTING WORDS
POD0000002993_S0000143 LES CAMPBELL WITH HIS AFRICAN DASHIKIS AND HIS NEGROLAND LESSONS
POD0000002993_S0000155 BUT IT JUST ROUNDED IT OUT WHERE I HAD HEARD ALL OF
POD0000002993_S0000161 IT WAS ABOUT LEARNING TO LOVE YOUR OWN
POD0000002993_S0000173 AND IF NOT WHY IS OCEAN HILL-BROWNSVILLE REMEMBERED THAT WAY
POD0000002993_S0000181 PAUL SAYS MOST PEOPLE IN OCEAN HILL-BROWNSVILLE WEREN'T EVEN THINKING ABOUT WHO WAS JEWISH AND WHO WASN'T AMONG THE GENERAL WASH OF WHITE PEOPLE IN POWER
POD0000002993_S0000189 IT HAD AN AWFUL LOT TO DO WITH HOW PEOPLE CAME TO SEE THE STRIKE IN PUBLIC TERMS IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO HEAR HIM SAY THAT BECAUSE IF ANY ONE PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW PEOPLE CAME TO SEE THE STRIKE IN PUBLIC TERMS
POD0000002993_S0000202 THE UNION CLAIMED THAT THIS LEAFLET HAD BEEN PLACED IN TEACHERS' MAILBOXES TO THREATEN THEM
POD0000002993_S0000215 AND THESE TWO ANSWERS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EITHER WAY
POD0000002993_S0000224 EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT BLACK ANTI-SEMITISM IN OCTOBER WHEN MAYOR LINDSAY WENT TO SPEAK AT THE JEWISH CENTER OF MIDWOOD
POD0000002993_S0000229 THEY PUBLISHED A LETTER IN THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYING THAT THEY HAD NEVER WITNESSED ANY ANTI-SEMITISM ON THE JOB BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
POD0000002993_S0000236 BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS A JEWISH PERSON I GOT TO SAY
POD0000002993_S0000245 BUT ALL THAT STARTED TO FALL AWAY
POD0000002993_S0000264 WE WERE ELECTED ONLY TO RUN THE SCHOOLS OF COURSE THE DIVERSITY OF IDEOLOGY AND ATTITUDE AMONG BLACK PEOPLE IN NEW YORK CITY WAS TOTALLY MISSED BY THE WHITE PRESS AT THE TIME
POD0000002993_S0000270 AT P S TWENTY ONE IN BED-STUY
POD0000002993_S0000284 BUT IN THE AFTERNOONS IN THE SPIRIT OF DOING THE RIGHT THING BY THE KIDS WE STARTED A FREEDOM SCHOOL IN THE BUTCHERS' CO-OP THE BUTCHERS' CO-OP IS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPLEX IN BROWNSVILLE BUILT ORIGINALLY FOR MEMBERS OF THE BUTCHERS UNION OK MAX
POD0000002993_S0000289 GO TO BROWNSVILLE AND TEACH BLACK STUDENTS IN A QUOTE-UNQUOTE FREEDOM SCHOOL
POD0000002993_S0000296 AT THE POINT BLACK PEOPLE START TALKING ABOUT FIGHTING FOR WHAT THEY CONSIDER LIBERATION ON THEIR OWN TERMS IN WAYS THAT DON'T INCLUDE WHITE PEOPLE IN LEADERSHIP
POD0000002993_S0000303 INCLUDING YOUR INTERVIEW WITH JAY
POD0000002993_S0000309 JAY AND HIS WIFE BONNIE ENDED UP BECOMING GOOD FRIENDS WITH MY UNCLE NEILSON AND MY AUNT LIL THEY WENT TO JAY'S KIDS' BAR MITZVAHS
POD0000002993_S0000315 JUST FOR THE RECORD YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF ON THE BACK
POD0000002993_S0000330 BUT MATH TEACHER CHARLIE ISAACS SAYS THERE WAS A SHORT PERIOD ABOUT THREE WEEKS AFTER THE END OF THE THIRD STRIKE THAT WAS IN SOME WAYS THE APEX OF THE EXPERIMENT
POD0000002993_S0000352 AND THIS IS MEANWHILE KIDS ARE FIGHTING THEIR GUERRILLA WAR AGAINST THE RETURNING TEACHERS AND AS THE PRESSURE INCREASED
POD0000002993_S0000361 AND THE FIRST CENTERED SQUARELY ON LESLIE CAMPBELL
POD0000002993_S0000368 HEY JEW BOY
POD0000002993_S0000376 AND I DON'T WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT
POD0000002993_S0000383 AND IN GENERAL THE QUALITY OF TEACHING THAT I SAW I WAS NOT TERRIBLY PLEASED WITH TWO SEVENTY-ONE HAD BEEN VISITED BY COUNTLESS REPORTERS AND ACADEMICS
POD0000002993_S0000400 I ASKED MONIFA HOW SHE FELT READING THIS TODAY
POD0000002993_S0000407 AWESOME BUT NOT IN A GREAT WAY
POD0000002993_S0000417 SHE'S BOTH A PARENT IN BROWNSVILLE AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE NEW YORK COALITION FOR EDUCATIONAL JUSTICE

POD0000003001_S0000101 SHE'D ALREADY BEEN WAITING ALMOST A DECADE FOR A GREEN CARD
POD0000003001_S0000108 IN THE PAST HE'S CALLED DACA UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND HE'S BACKED TRUMP'S CALL FOR A BORDER WALL
POD0000003001_S0000115 DON'T HAVE VERY LONG WAIT TIMES
POD0000003001_S0000124 DEMOCRATS LIKE REPRESENTATIVES KEITH ELLISON OF MINNESOTA AND GRACE MENG OF NEW YORK
POD0000003001_S0000130 WHO HER PEOPLE ARE
POD0000003001_S0000136 BUT SHE KNEW TOO WELL THE GRIEF THAT SUNAYANA FELT
POD0000003001_S0000144 BUT THE SHOOTER WHO KILLED THEM THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST LIKE HOW THE MAN WHO ALLEGEDLY KILLED SRINU THOUGHT SRINU WAS IRANIAN
POD0000003001_S0000149 THEN SHE HEARD ABOUT SRINIVAS KUCHIBHOTLA I COULDN'T FUNCTION WHEN I HEARD THAT I'VE HEARD OF OTHER HATE CRIMES HAPPENING BUT WHEN THEY'RE FURTHER AWAY FROM YOU

POD0000003009_S0000038 SO WE START JUDGING PEOPLE BEFORE WE EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO SAY TERRIBLE AND LOOK EVERYONE EVERYONE HAS SOME KIND OF ACCENT GENE
POD0000003009_S0000048 I'M TALKING TO ELIZABETH SMITH SHE'S ON HER LUNCH BREAK
POD0000003009_S0000054 WHAT STANDARD OF COURSE MEANS WE ALL KNOW THAT TYPICAL IS A WHITE GUY
POD0000003009_S0000071 AND THOSE ARE BOTH FEATURES OF THE INLAND NORTH SPEECH HE HEARD IN NORTHEASTERN OHIO AND THEN NBC PICKED UP HIS WORK AND USED IT AS A GUIDE FOR HOW THEIR ANCHORS SHOULD SPEAK

POD0000003009_S0000192 SO ALWAYS I FELT THAT PEOPLE WERE DOWNGRADING ME
POD0000003009_S0000198 NOT THE MAIN CHARACTERS
POD0000003009_S0000204 EVEN WORSE THAN THE GERMAN ACCENT WAS ASIAN ACCENT
POD0000003009_S0000217 PROFESSOR KANG BELIEVES THAT YOU KNOW NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE WORK ON PERFECTING OUR STANDARD AMERICAN ACCENT
POD0000003009_S0000222 NO MATTER WHAT

POD0000003025_S0000095 ROBIN D G KELLEY SAYS THE RED-BAITING FROM THE EMPLOYERS WAS PART OF A BIGGER PROPAGANDA STRATEGY BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN THE ELITES TALK ABOUT SOCIAL EQUALITY AS A THREAT
POD0000003025_S0000102 SO TO BE WHITE IN MINE MILL WAS TO BE A NIGGER LOVER BASICALLY AND SCARING AWAY WHITE PEOPLE FROM MINE MILL
POD0000003025_S0000108 ON THE MOUNTAIN WE WERE ON RED MOUNTAIN

POD0000003041_S0000030 WHICH IS
POD0000003041_S0000041 WELL FIRST OFF I FOUND THAT THE RESISTANCE TO THE CENSUS IS A VERY AMERICAN THING IT'S NOT JUST QUOTE UNQUOTE COLORED I'M USING YOUR AIR QUOTES HERE GENE AMERICANS I'LL ALLOW IT MARGO ANDERSON
POD0000003041_S0000054 WHEN NATIVE AMERICANS DID EVENTUALLY START BEING COUNTED THEY WERE DIVIDED UP INTO TWO CATEGORIES
POD0000003041_S0000078 TOM TALKED TO US FROM HIS HOME IN SEATTLE WHERE LIKE ALL OF US HE'S SHUT IN TO TRY TO FLATTEN THE CORONAVIRUS CURVE
POD0000003041_S0000090 AND WHERE THEY GOT THIS HELP WAS ACTUALLY CENSUS DATA THAT
POD0000003041_S0000099 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE GOVERNMENT KNEW WHERE THEY LIVED BECAUSE OF THE CENSUS
POD0000003041_S0000105 I DON'T GET THAT BUT IT IS THAT EFFORT WAS ULTIMATELY UNSUCCESSFUL AS CARDI B HAS BEEN REMINDING PEOPLE I LOVE HER AND NOT BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T PUSH REALLY REALLY HARD FOR IT
POD0000003041_S0000121 OUR PRODUCER KUMARI DEVARAJAN
POD0000003041_S0000130 I COME FROM A COUNTRY WHERE I CANNOT TRUST THE GOVERNMENT SO I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE FILLING OUT THE CENSUS THE CONCERN IS
POD0000003041_S0000141 IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME THAT WE SAW THE DIRECT EFFECTS AND THE DIRECT IMPACT
POD0000003041_S0000158 LIZETTE SAYS THERE ARE A BUNCH OF ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING LIZETTE'S ORGANIZATION NALEO
POD0000003041_S0000168 MICHAEL REMINDS US THAT IT'S ILLEGAL FOR CENSUS WORKERS TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE AGENCY
POD0000003041_S0000176 IT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF THE CORONAVIRUS AND EVERYBODY HAVING TO WORK FROM HOME THAT HE'S ABLE TO EAT DINNER WITH HIS KIDS RIGHT NOW
POD0000003041_S0000182 MARKETERS AND CORPORATIONS WENT AFTER THAT DATA SO FAST TARGET IS USING CENSUS DATA TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHERE THEY PUT PRODUCTS THAT'S TARGEY TO MOST OF US
POD0000003041_S0000191 SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE ME I WAS THREE-FIFTHS OF A MAN I WASN'T EVEN A WHOLE PERSON
POD0000003041_S0000201 WHERE ARE YOU
POD0000003041_S0000206 WHO'S BEEN COVERING THE POWER POLITICS AND MONEY BEHIND THE U S CENSUS FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS NOW
POD0000003041_S0000213 THE NAME SEX AGE DATE OF BIRTH AND RACE OF EACH PERSON LIVING IN THAT HOME
POD0000003041_S0000223 BUT EITHER WAY IT'S KIND OF SCARY PUTTING ALL YOUR INFORMATION OUT THERE AND THE GOVERNMENT IS STILL THE GOVERNMENT
POD0000003041_S0000242 THIS IMPACTS HOW VOTING DISTRICTS ARE REDRAWN
POD0000003041_S0000253 AND SO YOU HAVE NOW THIS PANDEMIC THAT REALLY EXACERBATES EXISTING CHALLENGES ALL OF THAT ASIDE
POD0000003041_S0000264 WOW
POD0000003049_S0000015 SO IF YOU'RE A DIEHARD CODE SWITCH READER
POD0000003049_S0000023 HAS COME TO MEAN A PROFOUND BETRAYAL
POD0000003049_S0000041 AND THE RESEARCHERS SAID THAT THIS HAS HUGE CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE MOST SOCIETIES TEND TO LOOK AT CHILDREN AS BEING INNOCENT AND IN NEED OF PROTECTION
POD0000003049_S0000048 WE UNDERSTAND ALL OF THAT
POD0000003049_S0000061 AND THE SUPERVISOR DIDN'T DENY THAT HE CALLED THEM BOY HE ONLY DENIED THAT IT WAS MEANT IN ANY SORT OF DEROGATORY WAY AND SO THIS LAWSUIT BECAME THIS EPIC LEGAL BATTLE THAT LASTED FOR DECADES
POD0000003049_S0000066 IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THE TERM STANDING ALONE IS ALWAYS BENIGN
POD0000003049_S0000074 AND THAT BLACK REPORTER WAS LIKE
POD0000003049_S0000095 BUT THE ORIGINS OF THIS WORD ACTUALLY TRACE BACK TO HINDI AND URDU
POD0000003049_S0000108 AND I HAD HONESTLY NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S USED ALL THE TIME
POD0000003049_S0000122 WAS THE FACT THAT HERE STUDENTS USED TO ADDRESS TEACHERS BY THEIR FIRST NAME
POD0000003049_S0000136 AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS TYPE OF USE OF THE WORD
POD0000003049_S0000155 RADICAL CHIC
POD0000003049_S0000167 THAT IS AN ISSUE TO ME IN MY BOOK I KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHAT AM I
POD0000003049_S0000182 SOLD DOWN THE RIVER COMES FROM THE PRACTICE OF TAKING BLACK FOLKS TO LOUISVILLE TO BE SOLD DOWN THE OHIO RIVER AND TRANSPORTED TO THE COTTON PLANTATIONS IN STATES FURTHER SOUTH YIKES YEAH OK OUR SECOND WORD COMES FROM WEST AFRICA
POD0000003049_S0000191 AND THIS MUSICAL PHRASE
POD0000003057_S0000006 IT'S LOOKING INCREASINGLY LIKELY THAT GETTING BACK TO NORMAL WILL HAPPEN IN STAGES
POD0000003057_S0000011 THE FIRST STAGE OF NORMAL IS STILL SOME TIME AWAY
POD0000003057_S0000017 THE MONEY WAS GIVEN TO BANKS
POD0000003057_S0000026 HE FOLLOWED UP AND HE FOLLOWED UP
POD0000003057_S0000037 ALSO ON TUESDAY TREASURY SECRETARY STEVE MNUCHIN SAID HE HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS TO PUT ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE PROGRAM
POD0000003057_S0000043 IT DOES NO GOOD TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO GO TO RESTAURANTS AND GO TO MOVIES AND GO TO CONCERTS BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST GOING TO GET EXTREMELY SICK AND HAVE TO STAY HOME FROM WORK ANYWAY
POD0000003057_S0000051 TYPICALLY YOU WOULD ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WHO WANTS TO WORK CAN WORK AND THEY'RE PAID A LIVING WAGE TO DO SO
POD0000003057_S0000059 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
POD0000003057_S0000068 BUT IF WE DON'T CLEAR THE WAY FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO TREAT THE SICK
POD0000003057_S0000079 CHICAGO
POD0000003057_S0000085 AND FIVE ARE DEAD WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CELEBRATE THE LIVES OF THOSE OF OUR MEMBERS THE WAY WE HAVE WE WOULD HAVE TRADITIONALLY DONE NO JAZZ FUNERALS NO SECOND LINES ALL HE CAN DO IS CONSOLE FAMILIES OVER THE PHONE ENCOURAGE THEM AND PRAY FOR THEM
POD0000003057_S0000100 FOR THE RECORD SHE DID NOT USE A TEST THAT COULD HAVE BEEN USED ON A HUMAN
POD0000003065_S0000008 BUT TESTING IS NOT THE ONLY PIECE OF THE PUZZLE SO THE IMPORTANT THING IS REALLY TO REACH OUT TO EACH AND EVERY PERSON
POD0000003065_S0000015 NOVEMBER DECEMBER
POD0000003065_S0000031 NPR'S JON HAMILTON REPORTS THE RECOVERY PROCESS CAN BE LONG AND GRUELING
POD0000003065_S0000047 AND THAT ALSO CAUSES DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN THEN THERE'S THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT
POD0000003065_S0000059 JOSE DE LOS RIOS IS ONE OF THE UNSUNG HEROES OF THIS PANDEMIC
POD0000003065_S0000065 AT LEAST A THIRD OR HALF OF MY NEIGHBORS STOP ME AND JOKINGLY ASK CAN I GET THEM SOME DE LOS RIOS AND HIS COLLEAGUES ARE MAKING AS MUCH TOILET PAPER AS THEY CAN RUNNING THE PLANT TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY WHILE ALSO TRYING TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE
POD0000003065_S0000070 BUT WORKERS HAVE ADJUSTED IT'S RATHER COMICAL LOOKING INTO A BREAK AREA NOW
POD0000003065_S0000077 NOT EVERY FACTORY OWNER HAS BEEN SO CAREFUL
POD0000003065_S0000084 THEY WON'T SKIMP ON THE TOILET PAPER
POD0000003065_S0000090 SNOPES DOT COM IS A GOOD ONE
POD0000003073_S0000012 MOST THINGS DO
POD0000003073_S0000024 EXPERTS DON'T KNOW WHY
POD0000003073_S0000034 THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO GET THE DISEASE JUST NEED TO REST WHILE THEIR IMMUNE CELLS SEEK AND DESTROY THE VIRUS
POD0000003073_S0000039 WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS
POD0000003073_S0000045 TESTS ARE SHOWING ELEVATED LEVELS OF CYTOKINE MOLECULES IN THE BLOOD OF SOME OF THE SICKEST PATIENTS
POD0000003073_S0000050 AND HE SAID HE WAS SEEING RESULTS EVERYONE DID REALLY WELL IT WAS ACTUALLY I HAVE TO ADMIT YESTERDAY WAS A GOOD DAY SOME PATIENTS RECOVERED IN A MATTER OF HOURS THE IMPACT WAS DRAMATIC SINCE THEN HE'S TREATED DOZENS OF COVID PATIENTS NOT ALL HAVE RESPONDED WELL BUT HE SAYS OVERALL HE THINKS IT'S DEFINITELY HELPING
POD0000003073_S0000057 AND MORE THAN THIRTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED
POD0000003073_S0000064 THEN A FEW WEEKS LATER THE ADMINISTRATION LAUNCHED PROJECT AIRBRIDGE TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE SUPPLY CRUNCH
POD0000003073_S0000077 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO MISS ABOUT NORMAL LIFE RIGHT NOW
POD0000003073_S0000085 FOR MORE ON THE CORONAVIRUS YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC RADIO STATION CAN KEEP YOU UP-TO-DATE THIS IS CORONAVIRUS DAILY
POD0000003081_S0000009 AND THANKS
POD0000003081_S0000021 SOME MORE THAN A WEEK EARLIER
POD0000003081_S0000041 IT'S IN THE EPISODE NOTES
POD0000003081_S0000054 UP FROM ABOUT FIFTY THEY HAD BEFORE ALL OF THIS STARTED
POD0000003081_S0000064 BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OF THESE WARDS THROUGHOUT THE HOSPITAL AND DOZENS MORE PATIENTS WAITING TO BE ADMITTED DOWN BELOW IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM
POD0000003081_S0000081 NEW YORK GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO SAYS THE PANDEMIC WON'T REACH ITS PEAK FOR SEVERAL MORE WEEKS
POD0000003081_S0000095 WE HEARD ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS PRETTY EARLY ON BECAUSE
POD0000003081_S0000105 BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS ACROSS THE BOARD YOU KNOW
POD0000003081_S0000113 WAS BECAUSE WE STARTED FEELING LIKE OUR STAFF WAS GETTING WORRIED ABOUT COMING TO WORK SOMETIMES
POD0000003081_S0000122 IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW
POD0000003081_S0000131 YOU CAN'T JUST SKIP A PAYMENT
POD0000003089_S0000008 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BIG LONG LOOK AT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE IN AMERICA
POD0000003089_S0000018 PARTLY THAT'S BECAUSE THE PUERTO RICAN GOVERNMENT HAD SAID FOR MONTHS THAT THE DEATH TOLL FROM HURRICANE MARIA WAS FEWER THAN A HUNDRED BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE STUDY SHOWED THAT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE DID NOT DIE IN THE STORM
POD0000003089_S0000025 AND THE HARDEST PART DR SUAREZ SAYS
POD0000003089_S0000035 AND SHE TOLD ME HOW THEY WENT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER
POD0000003089_S0000042 MARTA SUAREZ THE DOCTOR WE MENTIONED EARLIER
POD0000003089_S0000047 MY PHONE RANG
POD0000003089_S0000059 AND THAT GENERATOR KEPT JAVIER ALIVE WHEN THE POWER WENT OUT
POD0000003089_S0000069 ZAIDA AND HER FAMILY TRUST WHAT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT TELLS THEM
POD0000003089_S0000081 BUT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS
POD0000003089_S0000101 FEMA SAID ONLY ELEVEN OF SIXTY NINE HOSPITALS EITHER HAD ELECTRICITY OR FUEL FOR GENERATORS
POD0000003089_S0000112 AND HE HAD MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY
POD0000003089_S0000124 ANOTHER FAMILY LENDS THE BOY'S FAMILY THEIR CAR
POD0000003089_S0000137 THEY'RE ALREADY GONE
POD0000003089_S0000145 HOSPITALS NEED WORKING AIR CONDITIONING TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF GERMS
POD0000003089_S0000156 SOMEONE TELLS THEM THERE'S A GOVERNMENT-RUN SHELTER THEY COULD GO TO NEXT
POD0000003089_S0000162 SO NOW THE GOAL OF EVERY DAY IS TO FIND ENOUGH DIESEL TO KEEP THAT GENERATOR RUNNING
POD0000003089_S0000167 LUIS SHOWS A PICTURE OF JAVIER ON HIS VENTILATOR TO THIS WOMAN WHO OWNS A GAS STATION
POD0000003089_S0000172 THE GOVERNMENT KEEPS TELLING PEOPLE TO BE PATIENT AND POWER WILL BE BACK SOON
POD0000003089_S0000183 THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH JAVIER'S VENTILATOR
POD0000003089_S0000188 AROUND THREE IN THE MORNING
POD0000003089_S0000193 MINUTES GO BY
POD0000003089_S0000200 FINALLY
POD0000003089_S0000214 AND THEY DON'T THINK THEY CAN WAIT MUCH LONGER
POD0000003089_S0000222 SHE'S CONVINCED THAT RIGHT NOW JAVIER WOULD NOT BE ALIVE
POD0000003089_S0000230 SHE SAYS THERE ARE RULES FOR HOSPITALS TO FOLLOW TO PREPARE FOR DISASTERS
POD0000003089_S0000236 NO I DON'T
POD0000003089_S0000246 SO THAT'S ONE OF THE WORST MISTAKES THE GOVERNMENT MADE IN MY VIEW
POD0000003089_S0000253 BUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED ON REBUILDING OTHER POWER GRIDS SAY A LOT OF THE PROBLEM WAS JUST INCOMPETENCE
POD0000003089_S0000260 MOST PEOPLE THAT DIED DID NOT DIE THOSE FIRST SEVENTY TWO HOURS
POD0000003089_S0000266 BUT IN THE PAST THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID THAT HE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS GOVERNMENT'S FAILURES
POD0000003089_S0000271 OMAYA DOES NOT THINK PUERTO RICO IS PREPARED FOR ANOTHER HURRICANE LIKE MARIA
POD0000003089_S0000285 IT WAS EDITED BY LISA POLLAK ERIC MENNEL AND ME WITH HELP FROM ADRIAN FLORIDO AND MARK MEMMOTT
POD0000003089_S0000293 OTHER ORIGINAL MUSIC IS BY RAMTIN ARABLOUEI
POD0000003097_S0000017 I CAN'T PLAY YOU THE RECORDING OF OUR CALLS SHE'S AFRAID IF SHE USES HER NAME OR EVEN IF SOMEONE RECOGNIZES HER VOICE SHE COULD GET FIRED
POD0000003097_S0000023 THE ONLY THING I HAVE FOR THEM IS OXYGEN SHE SAID
POD0000003097_S0000029 HE'S A HEALTHY GUY WITH NO OTHER MEDICAL PROBLEMS
POD0000003097_S0000036 NO THANK YOU
POD0000003097_S0000042 AND THEN MY FRIEND CALLED THE MAN'S CLOSE RELATIVE JUST TO CONFIRM THIS WAS CONSISTENT WITH HIS WISHES AND THE RELATIVE SAID THAT IT WAS
POD0000003097_S0000049 I JUST FEEL SO ANGRY WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE THIS WAS TOTALLY PREVENTABLE
POD0000003097_S0000058 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS BREAK
POD0000003097_S0000081 BUT HE DID TELL ME BY EMAIL THAT HE WAS PROMOTING THESE TESTS AS A FAVOR TO HIS FRIEND WITH THE COMPANY THAT WAS SELLING THEM SO HE'S BASICALLY SAYING
POD0000003097_S0000086 OK WHO IS THIS COMPANY THAT JOHN SIMIDIAN WAS CONNECTED TO
POD0000003097_S0000097 HE SAYS ABSOLUTELY AND NOT ONLY THAT HE SAYS HE'LL SET UP A TIME TO TALK WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING FOR THIS COMPANY THE WELLNESS MATRIX GROUP
POD0000003097_S0000105 OK SO JUST WANT TO CONFIRM I'M RECORDING NOW
POD0000003097_S0000122 RIGHT
POD0000003097_S0000137 TURNS OUT THEY GOT THE SAME EMAIL THAT I GOT IN THE BEGINNING THE ONE FROM JOHN SIMIDIAN
POD0000003097_S0000143 AND THEY ALL HAD KIND OF DIFFERENT REASONS FOR WANTING TO BUY THE TEST KITS
POD0000003097_S0000152 IT'S REALLY MEANINGFUL AND REALLY VITAL BUT HE JUST THOUGHT
POD0000003097_S0000166 EVENTUALLY
POD0000003097_S0000173 AT THIS POINT
POD0000003097_S0000179 AND THEN BECAUSE THIS IS ALL UNFOLDING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
POD0000003097_S0000190 OK I KNOW AT-HOME TEST KITS ARE NOT APPROVED
POD0000003097_S0000198 THEY ASKED FOR THAT EXACT INFORMATION
POD0000003097_S0000206 IF THERE HAD BEEN WIDESPREAD TESTING AT THAT POINT LIKE ALL THE EXPERTS AGREE WE NEEDED TO HAVE
POD0000003097_S0000214 IF YOU OR ANYONE YOU KNOW HAS TRIED TO GET ANYTHING CALLING ITSELF AN AT-HOME TEST KIT

POD0000003105_S0000016 AND IT WAS DESIGNED TO GET BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS
POD0000003105_S0000021 AND SO HE IS THE GUY WHO GOES ON TALK SHOWS TO CRITICIZE JOHN MCCAIN'S BILL
POD0000003105_S0000031 AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HOW THIS ONE MAN'S VISION TO ALLOW MORE AND MORE MONEY INTO POLITICS A VISION THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE STOOD UP FOR AT THAT TIME HOW THAT VISION BECAME THE WORLD WE LIVE IN THAT IS COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK

POD0000003105_S0000069 I LOST IT'S OVER

POD0000003105_S0000083 I MEAN IT'S A COMPLICATED QUESTION BECAUSE YEAH

POD0000003113_S0000256 BETH LIVED IN A LOW HOUSE WITH A FRONT PORCH ACROSS THE STREET FROM GAYLE
POD0000003113_S0000263 RIGHT LIKE I CAN FIND A NEW PLACE TO LIVE
POD0000003113_S0000268 GAYLE'S HOUSE HAS THIS BIG WINDOW THAT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE SIDEWALK
POD0000003113_S0000273 IT FELT TO BETH LIKE GAYLE WAS TRYING TO PUBLICLY SHAME HER AND INVADE HER PRIVACY AS RETRIBUTION FOR BETH'S DECISION TO MOVE THE WAY I SEE IT
POD0000003113_S0000280 HUMAN LIFE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
POD0000003113_S0000288 IT FELT LIKE NOBODY COULD AGREE ON WHAT TO DO
POD0000003113_S0000295 THE PROBLEM CAN'T BE FIXED BY ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS ALONE BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY AN ENGINEERING PROBLEM
POD0000003113_S0000305 AFTER SIX MONTHS OF SQUABBLING THE DEMOLITION PROPOSAL HAD STALLED
POD0000003113_S0000311 THERE WAS ALSO A TUNNEL IN THE MIX TO DIVERT WATER WHICH WAS SOMETHING THAT SOME PEOPLE IN TOWN HAD SUGGESTED
POD0000003113_S0000322 GAYLE STILL OPPOSES IT
POD0000003113_S0000327 EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO GRIEVING THE LOSS OF WHAT THE TOWN USED TO BE BEFORE THE FLOODS
POD0000003113_S0000333 SHE PAID OFF HER MORTGAGE DECADES AGO
POD0000003113_S0000339 SHE COULD SELL THE BUILDING WHEN SHE RETIRED IN A FEW YEARS
POD0000003113_S0000346 SALLY TRIED TO REOPEN ACROSS THE STREET BUT HER BUSINESS JUST WASN'T VIABLE ANYMORE
POD0000003113_S0000356 STILL CLEANING OUT HER STORE
POD0000003113_S0000364 SO SOMETIMES I FEEL A SENSE OF OPTIMISM LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO FIX IT

POD0000003121_S0000022 I LOVE THIS
POD0000003121_S0000043 IT TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT IT TURNED OUT TO BE A HUGE PHENOMENON
POD0000003121_S0000051 ZUCKER IS NOW THE HEAD OF CNN WHICH COVERED TRUMP A LOT DURING THE CAMPAIGN
POD0000003121_S0000063 SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE AND PRIVATE RESORTS LIKE MAR-A-LAGO
POD0000003121_S0000079 ALL OF THIS WOULD BE PRETTY INTERESTING NO MATTER WHERE DONALD TRUMP HAD ENDED UP
POD0000003121_S0000085 SO TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR HOW THE APPRENTICE GOT TO BE SUCH A HUGE DEAL AND MEET SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO MADE THAT HAPPEN
POD0000003121_S0000091 AND HE SAYS SHOW PRODUCERS PUT ADS ON TV AND IN THE NEWSPAPERS FOR CONTESTANTS
POD0000003121_S0000103 LIKE OH IF THESE PEOPLE TRYING OUT FOR THE SHOW LIKE TRUMP SO MUCH
POD0000003121_S0000115 AND HERE'S HOW THE SHOW WORKED
POD0000003121_S0000134 LIKE THE ULTIMATE PRIZE WAS TO GET AS CLOSE TO TRUMP AS POSSIBLE OR TO JUST LIVE HIS LIFE IF EVEN A LITTLE
POD0000003121_S0000145 SO THE PRODUCERS OF COURSE CUT HEIDI'S REACTION OUT
POD0000003121_S0000154 WE TALKED TO A HANDFUL OF CONTESTANTS FROM THE FIRST SEASON ABOUT THIS
POD0000003121_S0000168 HIS SENIOR QUOTE IN THE YEARBOOK WAS TRUMP I'M COMING LIKE ONE DAY I'LL BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS YOU
POD0000003121_S0000188 WHO'S KIND OF FREAKING OUT
POD0000003121_S0000201 AND HE SAYS IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH HOW HE FEELS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP
POD0000003121_S0000208 BUT HE REPRESENTED SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T LET PEOPLE TALK DOWN TO HIM HE HAD THE ARROGANCE AND THE COCKINESS
POD0000003121_S0000217 AND I HAD I CONTINUE TO GO WHOA
POD0000003121_S0000225 AND THE NEXT YEAR AFTER THAT FIRST SEASON OF THE APPRENTICE
POD0000003121_S0000255 SO YEAH
POD0000003121_S0000265 AND PRUITT SAYS TRUMP WAS LIKE WE JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE
POD0000003121_S0000282 EVERYONE IN THE ROOM WENT
POD0000003121_S0000303 THERE ARE FAR WORSE
POD0000003121_S0000315 HE DOES NOT HAVE THE TAPES
POD0000003121_S0000325 LIKE OTHER PEOPLE TALKING THAT WAY TO
POD0000003121_S0000332 TOLD HIM NOT TO SAY THINGS LIKE THAT
POD0000003121_S0000340 YOU KNOW REASON WE'RE ALL HERE
POD0000003121_S0000346 AND YOU KNOW YOU DO SOME SOUL-SEARCHING BUT HE DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING
POD0000003121_S0000351 HE REALLY STRUGGLES WITH IT NOW
POD0000003121_S0000366 EVEN WHEN SOME OF THOSE BUSINESSES WEREN'T ACTUALLY DOING VERY WELL THE BRANDS YOU KNOW
POD0000003121_S0000374 YOU CREATED A FICTION A FICTIONAL BILLIONAIRE WELL HE HAD BEEN A BILLIONAIRE I MEAN EVERYTHING WE SAID ABOUT HIM WAS TRUTHFUL
POD0000003121_S0000381 BILL SAYS HE WAS A GOOD CON ARTIST
POD0000003121_S0000390 HE WORKS ON DOCUMENTARIES
POD0000003129_S0000011 AS THEY BOTH CRIED AND CRIED
POD0000003129_S0000019 HE HAS EXPERIENCED WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AT THE BEDSIDE OF SICK PATIENTS
POD0000003129_S0000026 THIS WEEK ON HIDDEN BRAIN
POD0000003129_S0000036 BASED ON WHAT HE LEARNED AS SURGEON GENERAL HE'S WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM THAT IS OFTEN HIDDEN FROM VIEW
POD0000003129_S0000043 WHEN THEY LOST A JOB OR GOT SICK THEY HAD BROUGHT OVER FOOD
POD0000003129_S0000048 QUOTE-UNQUOTE SHAMEFUL DISEASE
POD0000003129_S0000059 WHAT DID YOU HEAR
POD0000003129_S0000065 AND THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY SAY THAT THEY WERE STRUGGLING WITH LONELINESS
POD0000003129_S0000076 BUT AT THE END OF EACH DAY WHEN I WAS ON THE ROAD I WOULD GO BACK TO MY HOTEL ROOM AFTER A FULL DAY AND NIGHTS' WORTH OF MEETINGS AND I WOULD JUST TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO REFLECT ON WHAT I HAD HEARD
POD0000003129_S0000082 DEMENTIA
POD0000003129_S0000091 SO RAJESH WAS A RELATIVE FROM INDIA WHO CAME OVER A LITTLE BIT LATER IN LIFE WHEN HE WAS PERHAPS IN HIS FIFTY S EARLY FIFTY S
POD0000003129_S0000101 RAJESH LOST HIS JOB
POD0000003129_S0000111 A WARNING THAT THIS NEXT PART OF THE STORY INVOLVES A DISCUSSION OF SUICIDE WHAT HAPPENED ONE DAY AS I WAS WORKING AT HOME ON A SUNDAY WITH MY SISTER WE WERE DOING HOMEWORK AT THE DINING TABLE
POD0000003129_S0000118 AND WHEN HIS HEARING AIDS WERE OUT
POD0000003129_S0000128 AND SHE SAID LET ME DO THAT AND SHE HUNG UP
POD0000003129_S0000134 WE BROKE DOWN THE DOOR
POD0000003129_S0000142 NOT SURE WHAT TO SAY AND NOT SURE WHAT TO DO
POD0000003129_S0000149 I WANT TO TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT THE GENERAL CONNECTION BETWEEN SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS AND THE PHENOMENON OF SUICIDE
POD0000003129_S0000159 BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS
POD0000003129_S0000166 THAT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MEDICINES WE HAVE
POD0000003129_S0000176 IN FACT
POD0000003129_S0000187 I'M SPEAKING TODAY WITH PHYSICIAN VIVEK MURTHY
POD0000003129_S0000194 BEING TOGETHER IN TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS INCREASED THE CHANCES THAT WE COULD POOL OUR FOOD AND ALL HAVE SOME FOOD DAY TO DAY AS OPPOSED TO STARVING
POD0000003129_S0000199 AND THAT DANGER RESONATED THROUGH OUR BODY IN THE FORM OF A STRESS STATE THAT WAS MARKED BY AN OUTFLOW OF STRESS HORMONES WHICH IN THE SHORT TERM COULD BE BENEFICIAL BECAUSE THEY COULD FOCUS YOUR MIND AND ENSURE THAT YOU COULD REACT QUICKLY IF A PREDATOR WAS INDEED BEHIND YOU
POD0000003129_S0000204 AND AGAIN IN THE SHORT TERM
POD0000003129_S0000214 WHY WAS THAT
POD0000003129_S0000220 AND I WANTED TO SPEND TIME AND BUILD FRIENDSHIPS BUT THEY WERE JUST HARD TO COME BY
POD0000003129_S0000228 YOU KNOW I NEVER DID TELL MY PARENTS BECAUSE I WAS ASHAMED
POD0000003129_S0000239 AND THAT MAKES SENSE FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY STANDPOINT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN A THREAT STATE YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON YOURSELF TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE SAFE
POD0000003129_S0000249 IT SHOWS UP IN LOTS OF OTHER WAYS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON OUR BEHAVIOR AND OUR HEALTH
POD0000003129_S0000270 AND JAMES WALKED IN
POD0000003129_S0000279 HE DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF MONEY AND SO HE LIVED IN A MODEST NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE BOSTON AREA
POD0000003129_S0000288 AND HE STARTED TO REALIZE THAT HAVING QUOTE-UNQUOTE MADE IT
POD0000003129_S0000296 IT WAS A HUMBLING REMINDER THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT I HAD STUDIED IN MEDICAL SCHOOL HAD NOT REALLY PREPARED ME FOR THIS MOMENT BECAUSE I HAD NEVER REALLY STUDIED ANYTHING ABOUT LONELINESS OR UNDERSTOOD IT TO BE A PROBLEM
POD0000003129_S0000316 BUT WHEN SHE GOT BACK HOME OVER THE SUMMER AFTER HER FIRST YEAR AT SCHOOL
POD0000003129_S0000322 SHE LOVED BEEKEEPING
POD0000003129_S0000332 WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE VALUE TO BRING TO THE WORLD
POD0000003129_S0000338 IN SERENA'S CASE
POD0000003129_S0000344 RECAPTURE SOLITUDE IN A PLACE OF COMFORT THAT ALLOWED HER TO REFLECT MORE DEEPLY ON HER EXPERIENCES
POD0000003129_S0000350 BUT SHE HAD TO BE ABLE TO ACCEPT HERSELF FOR WHO SHE WAS
POD0000003129_S0000375 CAN YOU TALK LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS HAVE CREATED
POD0000003129_S0000382 AND THESE ARE TWO DEAR FRIENDS OF MINE WHO I LOVE SEEING
POD0000003129_S0000392 GOING TO TALK ABOUT OUR HEALTH
POD0000003129_S0000399 THOSE CALLS BECAME MY LIFELINE
POD0000003129_S0000413 ABSOLUTELY THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL LESSONS THAT I LEARNED
POD0000003129_S0000420 AND THAT CAN BE EXTRAORDINARILY POWERFUL IN BREAKING THAT DOWNWARD SPIRAL OF LONELINESS WHICH IS SO DANGEROUS IF WE LOOK AROUND US
POD0000003129_S0000437 THIS WEEK'S SHOW WAS PRODUCED BY PARTH SHAH AND EDITED BY TARA BOYLE AND RHAINA COHEN TECHNICAL SUPPORT FROM ANDY HUETHER
POD0000003129_S0000442 THIS CAN BE CHALLENGING BECAUSE OUR GUESTS ARE ALSO OFTEN AT HOME
POD0000003129_S0000452 IF THIS EPISODE SPOKE TO YOU
POD0000003137_S0000011 ROBOTS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ARE PLAYING AN EVER LARGER ROLE IN ALL OF OUR LIVES
POD0000003137_S0000021 KATE DARLING IS A RESEARCH SPECIALIST AT THE MIT MEDIA LAB
POD0000003137_S0000027 BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT
POD0000003137_S0000042 RIGHT NO OK
POD0000003137_S0000057 AND EVERY TIME IT STEPPED ON A LANDMINE ONE OF THE LEGS WOULD BLOW UP
POD0000003137_S0000067 THEY HAVE A LOT OF MOTORS AND TOUCH SENSORS
POD0000003137_S0000083 A SPARE NAME THAT YOU MIGHT CARE TO GIVE THE DINOSAUR
POD0000003137_S0000091 I REALLY LOVE THAT
POD0000003137_S0000110 SO THE WORKSHOP THAT WE DID
POD0000003137_S0000126 SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON I MEAN
POD0000003137_S0000142 YES POSSIBLY I MEAN
POD0000003137_S0000161 YEAH I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PROJECTION HAPPENING THERE I ALSO THINK THAT BEFORE WE GET TO THE QUESTION OF ROBOT RIGHTS AND CONSCIOUSNESS
POD0000003137_S0000172 MANY OF THE INTELLIGENT ASSISTANTS BEING BUILT BY MAJOR COMPANIES SIRI OR ALEXA ARE BEING GIVEN WOMEN'S NAMES
POD0000003137_S0000185 YOU HAVE TO WONDER TO WHAT EXTENT THAT GETS MUDDLED IN OUR SUBCONSCIOUS AND NOT JUST IN CHILDREN'S SUBCONSCIOUS BUT MAYBE EVEN IN OUR OWN DO YOU THINK IT'S A COINCIDENCE THAT MOST OF THE VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS ARE GIVEN FEMALE NAMES AND FEMALE IDENTITIES
POD0000003137_S0000207 YOU COULD SORT OF MAKE A PROPERTY RIGHTS ARGUMENT AND SAY THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH THEIR PROPERTY BUT I THINK MANY OF US WOULD SAY EVEN THOUGH THE CHICKEN BELONGS TO YOU THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO WITH THE CHICKEN AND I'M NOT SURE IT'S JUST ABOUT OUR CONCERN THAT IF YOU MISTREAT THE CHICKEN
POD0000003137_S0000218 I DON'T KNOW ARE YOU
POD0000003137_S0000234 ARE YOU REAL
POD0000003137_S0000247 I HAVEN'T EXPLICITLY SAID THAT TO HIM
POD0000003137_S0000261 I'M SHANKAR VEDANTAM
POD0000003145_S0000020 HE DID INVENT TECHNIQUES THAT HELP WOMEN TO THIS DAY
POD0000003145_S0000029 SO ON THE ONE HAND YOU COULD SAY SIMS WAS DOING WHAT DOCTORS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO BY TAKING THESE WOMEN ON AS PATIENTS
POD0000003145_S0000034 BECAME PROPS IN HIS JOURNEY OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY THESE WOMEN WERE PROPERTY
POD0000003145_S0000040 THESE WOMEN WERE BROUGHT TO HIM BY THEIR OWNERS
POD0000003145_S0000049 HE WRITES THAT THE WOMEN WANTED THE SURGERY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO HAVE THE CONDITION ANYMORE WERE THE SURGERIES THAT HE WAS PERFORMING ON THEM PERFORMED WITHOUT ANESTHESIA THEY WERE PERFORMED WITHOUT ANESTHESIA
POD0000003145_S0000056 WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW THESE WOMEN'S DIGNITY WERE ALSO TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM FOR A LONG TIME
POD0000003145_S0000063 THE ONLY THING WE KNOW IS THAT SIMS SAID THAT THESE WOMEN ONE OF THE WOMEN CLAMOROUSLY WANTED TO HAVE THE SURGERY
POD0000003145_S0000069 SIMS LEFT IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTY S HE LEFT ALABAMA AND MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY FOR HEALTH REASONS
POD0000003145_S0000077 BUT A LOT OF YOUR WORK HAS ACTUALLY TRIED TO BROADEN THAT IDEA AND SAID YES THAT WAS THEN
POD0000003145_S0000082 YES
POD0000003145_S0000090 THERE IS A VIDEO THAT JOHNS HOPKINS PUT OUT ABOUT PEOPLE WITH SICKLE CELL DISEASE
POD0000003145_S0000098 AND THEY LOOKED AT MEDICAL TEXTBOOKS
POD0000003145_S0000106 BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN'T FORGET HOW THAT CAME TO BE I'M WONDERING AS SOMEONE WHO IS A PHYSICIAN HERSELF
POD0000003145_S0000111 LAST SPRING I WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I'M CONFLICTED
POD0000003145_S0000117 AND ON AN ART DECO BUILDING
POD0000003145_S0000125 AND SO I THINK THAT
POD0000003145_S0000130 WHAT ABOUT BETSEY
POD0000003145_S0000135 AND IF WE WHISK AWAY THESE IMAGES OF SIMS
POD0000003145_S0000142 THEY WOULD TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW
POD0000003145_S0000147 THEY WOULD WANT US TO KNOW
POD0000003145_S0000155 BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO THINK OF THEM AS VICTIMS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS
POD0000003145_S0000161 IS
POD0000003145_S0000179 AND SHE RECENTLY WROTE ABOUT A MEDICAL EXPERIENCE SHE HAD IN A BOOK CALLED PATIENT
POD0000003145_S0000188 I STARTED A THOUGHT THAT IS QUITE BENIGN AND END UP PECCANT
POD0000003145_S0000194 A BODY
POD0000003145_S0000200 THE RESEARCH QUESTION IS WHY AM I PATIENT
POD0000003145_S0000206 SHE WAS EXPERIENCING THE DEATH OF ONE OF HER ORGANS THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING CALLED AN IMPATIENT
POD0000003145_S0000213 ANARCHA BETSEY AND LUCY BEGAN TO HAUNT HER MORPHINE-FUELED DREAMS
POD0000003145_S0000223 WE WAKE UN-ANESTHETIZED OR ADDICTED TO OPIUM CHILDREN BORN CHILDREN DISAPPEARED HELPLESS HELP
POD0000003145_S0000237 MORE PLIABLE THAN PEWTER
POD0000003145_S0000247 SHE HAD A MOMENT OF OUTBURST
POD0000003145_S0000252 WHICH AS YOU KNOW
POD0000003156_S0000010 WE USE MONEY TO EXPRESS OUR FEELINGS TO PROJECT OUR STATUS TO DEFEND OUR VALUES
POD0000003156_S0000016 THIS WEEK ON HIDDEN BRAIN
POD0000003156_S0000028 IT'S A SYMBOL OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN IT'S A SYMBOL OF YOU SUPPORTING THE LITTLE GUY OF YOU SUPPORTING THE UNDERDOG AND TRYING TO STICK IT TO THE MAN
POD0000003156_S0000034 HOW TWO KIDS DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE TO EXPLORE A DREAM IN SOMEONE'S GARAGE SO THIS IS WHAT WE CALL WE HAVE ANOTHER PAPER AROUND UNDERDOG BRAND BIOGRAPHIES AND THIS SORT OF IDEA OF KIND OF STARTING IN A GARAGE FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS BUT OVERCOMING OBSTACLES TO KIND OF FULFILL YOUR DREAM
POD0000003156_S0000050 STAY WITH US
POD0000003156_S0000057 BUT AS NEERU PAHARIA HAS EXPLORED
POD0000003156_S0000066 OH IF WE SEE A PAIR OF SHOES THAT WE DON'T LIKE WE MAY SAY OH SWEATSHOP LABOR IS WRONG I DON'T LIKE SWEATSHOP LABOR I DON'T APPROVE BUT IF THE SHOES ARE CUTE YOU MIGHT SAY SOMETHING LIKE OH IT'S OK BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED JOBS OR COMPANIES NEED TO MAKE MONEY
POD0000003156_S0000077 YOU KNOW UNDER SOME UNFORTUNATE CONDITIONS
POD0000003156_S0000094 AND IT TURNS OUT PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO BE CONFRONTED WITH THIS KIND OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THEIR BELIEFS AND
POD0000003156_S0000109 AND SHE'S ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HOW PEOPLE COME FROM GOOD FAMILIES OR NOT
POD0000003156_S0000119 THAT WAS HAPPENING THROUGH BUYING YOU KNOW REALLY EXPENSIVE CARS SO A LOT OF MY PARENTS' FRIENDS THEY HAD JAGUARS
POD0000003156_S0000134 HE'S THE HOST OF MORNING EDITION AND HE PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN DEVELOPING HIDDEN BRAIN ON THE RADIO
POD0000003164_S0000014 HE REALLY HELPED ME LIKE
POD0000003164_S0000023 OR ADULTS FOR THAT MATTER
POD0000003164_S0000035 IF YOU CONNECT DEEPLY
POD0000003164_S0000042 WE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT MISGUIDED NOTIONS OF MASCULINITY IN THE UNITED STATES
POD0000003164_S0000050 HE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT MADE PEOPLE HEALTHY
POD0000003164_S0000058 SOME STUDENTS WENT ON TO HAVE DISTINGUISHED CAREERS BEYOND DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGEMENT
POD0000003164_S0000065 RESEARCHERS MEASURED EVERYTHING FROM THE SIZE OF THEIR MOLES TO THE LACTIC ACID THEIR BODIES RELEASED AFTER FIVE MINUTES ON A TREADMILL
POD0000003164_S0000071 HE'S THE CURRENT DIRECTOR OF THE PROJECT
POD0000003164_S0000076 ITS AIMS WERE HAZY
POD0000003164_S0000082 AND THERE WERE EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWS ABOUT THE YOUNG MEN'S EMOTIONAL LIVES ALSO SOME PERSONALITY ASSESSMENTS AND SOME ASSESSMENTS OF THEIR EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY
POD0000003164_S0000087 IT TURNED OUT THAT MEN WHO HAD SOMEONE TO TURN TO WERE HAPPIER WITH THEIR LIVES AND THEIR MARRIAGES
POD0000003164_S0000097 THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL CONNECTIONS ISN'T OBVIOUS TO MOST OF US
POD0000003164_S0000106 THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE IN RETIREMENT ARE THOSE WHO ACTIVELY WORK TO REPLACE COLLEAGUES WITH FRIENDS
POD0000003164_S0000111 ALL MEN
POD0000003164_S0000119 I THINK I VIEWED IT AS SORT OF A CIRCUMSTANCE RATHER THAN A PROBLEM
POD0000003164_S0000127 BACK IN TWO THOUSAND
POD0000003164_S0000132 ONE THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS MEN
POD0000003164_S0000146 PAUL MISSED HIS COMFORT FOODS
POD0000003164_S0000154 THEN SOUTH CAROLINA
POD0000003164_S0000159 A MILITARY COLLEGE IN SOUTH CAROLINA
POD0000003164_S0000165 HE GOT MARRIED HAD A CHILD
POD0000003164_S0000174 HIS MOTHER HAD DIED YOUNG
POD0000003164_S0000185 HE GOT INTO EXERCISE
POD0000003164_S0000194 TO FEEL SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED
POD0000003164_S0000202 HE WENT TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO NEIGHBORS IN HIS APARTMENT BUILDING BUT FOUND THEM MORE BEWILDERED THAN FRIENDLY IT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING THEY SAID IN PARTICULAR IT'S KIND OF THE LOOKS THE COUNTENANCE
POD0000003164_S0000209 AFTER HE STARTED DATING
POD0000003164_S0000217 YOU KNOW SELF-IMPOSED THING OR ACTUALLY SOCIETY VIEWS IT THAT WAY
POD0000003164_S0000224 EVEN WHEN THEY WANTED TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS
POD0000003164_S0000237 IF MANY MEN IN HETEROSEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS COUNT ON WIVES TO BE THEIR SOLE PROVIDERS OF SOCIAL CONNECTION
POD0000003164_S0000246 INCREASINGLY HOWEVER
POD0000003164_S0000253 ONE COMMON INTERPRETATION OF THIS TREND IS THAT IT'S DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
POD0000003164_S0000261 MANY ARE OPTING OUT OF MARRIAGE
POD0000003164_S0000272 LET ME PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY
POD0000003164_S0000281 THIS IS HIDDEN BRAIN I'M SHANKAR VEDANTAM
POD0000003164_S0000290 SHE EXPECTED THE BOYS IN HER SCHOOL TO TALK ABOUT THEIR CLASSES
POD0000003164_S0000299 AND THE FOUR OF THEM WERE PROCESSING THEIR FEELINGS AROUND THIS MEAN BEHAVIOR BY ONE OF THE BOYS TOWARDS THE OTHER BOYS
POD0000003164_S0000307 WHICH SHE HEARD FROM A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD NAMED JUSTIN
POD0000003164_S0000313 AND THAT'S ALL THAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT IN OUR FRIENDSHIP
POD0000003164_S0000318 IF YOU JUST HAVE YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR PARENTS TO TALK TO
POD0000003164_S0000326 A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR DESCRIBED HOW HIS FRIENDSHIPS HAVE CHANGED SINCE FRESHMAN YEAR MY FRIENDSHIP WITH MY BEST FRIEND IS FADING BUT I'M SAYING IT'S STILL THERE
POD0000003164_S0000333 SO THE IDEA IS THAT BOYS AREN'T JUST BEING EMOTIONAL
POD0000003164_S0000354 BUT SHE THINKS THAT BOYS OF ALL SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS FIND THEMSELVES IN STRAITJACKETS THAT TELL THEM THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG IF THEY APPEAR EXCESSIVELY EMOTIONAL
POD0000003164_S0000363 THEIR DIARY ENTRIES START TO REVEAL MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS NIOBE'S CONCERN LED HER TO TEAM UP WITH ANOTHER PROFESSOR AND A MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER
POD0000003164_S0000368 MY PRODUCER RHAINA COHEN
POD0000003164_S0000384 SO LIKE YOU KIND OF SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEM THAN YOU DO WITH YOUR BEST FRIENDS AND THEN THEY MIGHT GET JEALOUS AND REACT OF COURSE
POD0000003164_S0000395 THEY CAN HUG EACH OTHER
POD0000003164_S0000401 BINGE DRINKING AND SEXUAL CONQUEST
POD0000003164_S0000410 I LOVE YOU
POD0000003164_S0000418 BOTH MEN AND WOMEN ARE PLAGUED BY A BIAS THAT PUSHES US TOWARDS ISOLATION RATHER THAN CONNECTION
POD0000003164_S0000423 NICK IS A BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO BOOTH SCHOOL OF BUSINESS
POD0000003164_S0000430 THAT WE THINK WE'D BE HAPPIER SITTING IN SOLITUDE
POD0000003164_S0000440 IN ONE STUDY VOLUNTEERS WERE ASKED WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE ON THE TRAIN WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TALKING TO YOU OR WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK TO YOU IF YOU TRIED
POD0000003164_S0000447 THERE'S ANXIETY ABOUT ACTUALLY STARTING THE CONVERSATION
POD0000003164_S0000454 IN SOME CONTEXTS
POD0000003164_S0000466 IF WE COULD BE OK WITH BEING VULNERABLE WITH BEING DEPENDENT ON SOMEONE WHO'S NOT A SPOUSE
POD0000003164_S0000473 WE HAD ORIGINAL MUSIC COMPOSED BY RAMTIN ARABLOUEI
POD0000003164_S0000478 SHE KINDLY MANAGED A LONG STRING OF EMAILS AS SHE COORDINATED BETWEEN OUR PRODUCER
POD0000003164_S0000484 ASK THEM
POD0000003172_S0000006 I KNOW PEOPLE SAY THIS ALL THE TIME BUT I REALLY MEAN IT
POD0000003172_S0000011 IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE IN COLLEGE PLEASE GIVE THIS A LISTEN AND SHARE IT WITH OTHERS WHO MIGHT NEED TO HEAR IT
POD0000003172_S0000026 MAYBE EVEN SOMETHING TO BE ASHAMED ABOUT I THINK IT FEELS BAD TO BE USED BUT I THINK THE ALTERNATIVE IS THAT NOBODY WANTS TO USE YOU AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WORSE
POD0000003172_S0000032 THOSE WHO EMBRACE THE CULTURE AND THOSE WHO WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
POD0000003172_S0000038 AND THE FACT IS THAT THERE'S A PRETTY RIGID SET OF RULES FOR HOW HOOKUPS HAPPEN
POD0000003172_S0000044 WHICH CREATES A CONUNDRUM BECAUSE PART OF HOOKING UP IS TRYING TO HOOK UP WITH PEOPLE THAT YOUR FRIENDS APPROVE OF AND THINK ARE LIKE A GOOD CATCH
POD0000003172_S0000060 SO IF TWO STUDENTS ARE GOING TO HOOK UP TOGETHER AND THEY WANT IT TO BE MEANINGLESS
POD0000003172_S0000068 THEN THAT HELPS SEND THE MESSAGE THAT IT'S MEANINGLESS
POD0000003172_S0000082 ABOUT A THIRD OF STUDENTS ARE COMPLETELY OPTED OUT
POD0000003172_S0000088 RACIAL MINORITIES FACE ALL KINDS OF COMPLICATED PROBLEMS THAT WHITE STUDENTS DON'T
POD0000003172_S0000095 BUT THEY ALSO TEND TO GET PULLED OUT BECAUSE RACIAL MINORITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RELIGIOUS
POD0000003172_S0000103 OR THEY GO OFF CAMPUS AND THAT IS WHY GRINDR HIT COLLEGE CAMPUSES WAY EARLIER THAN TINDER DID BECAUSE A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO IDENTIFIED AS NON-HETEROSEXUAL WERE USING IT TO FIND HOOKUPS OFF CAMPUS
POD0000003172_S0000112 BUT ONE OF THE STUDENTS WE SPOKE WITH LISA SAID THAT WHAT SOMETIMES STARTS OUT SOUNDING LIKE EMPOWERMENT OFTEN BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE I DID HAVE EXPERIENCES WHERE THE EXPECTATIONS ONCE THE HOOKUP HAD ALREADY STARTED WOULD START TO COME OUT
POD0000003172_S0000121 SO PART OF THE REASON WE SEE HOOKUP CULTURE ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION AND THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT
POD0000003172_S0000129 SO WE'RE EXCITED WHEN SHE LIKES TO PLAY WITH ENGINEERING TOYS WHEN SHE'S A KID AND WE'RE EXCITED WHEN SHE CHOOSES SPORTS OVER CHEERLEADING AND WE'RE EXCITED THAT SHE DECIDES TO MAJOR IN PHYSICS INSTEAD OF EDUCATION
POD0000003172_S0000136 THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF GOOD OPTIONS FOR WOMEN IN HOOKUP CULTURE THAT DON'T TRULY ENJOY CASUAL SEX AND THERE ARE SOME THAT DO
POD0000003172_S0000144 SHE COULD PROBABLY STAY IN THE GOOD GIRL CAMP ALTHOUGH THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
POD0000003172_S0000156 YEAH
POD0000003172_S0000168 AND BECAUSE THE RULE IS TO CARE LESS THAN THE OTHER PERSON
POD0000003172_S0000175 AND WHEN YOU ASK ACTUALLY MEN ARE MORE LIKELY THAN WOMEN BY A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS TO SAY THAT THEY WISH THEY COULD BE IN A RELATIONSHIP HAVING MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS HAVING MEANINGFUL SEXUAL EXPERIENCES THAT ARE KIND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE WANTS
POD0000003172_S0000181 YEAH
POD0000003172_S0000190 LISA WADE IS A SOCIOLOGIST AT OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE AND THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK AMERICAN HOOKUP THE NEW CULTURE OF SEX ON CAMPUS
POD0000003172_S0000196 ALAN REALLY GOT WHAT HIDDEN BRAIN IS ALL ABOUT AND HIS ENTHUSIASM CAME THROUGH IN HIS EFFORTS TO CONNECT NEW LISTENERS TO THE SHOW HIS TEAM DEVELOPED THE LOGO FOR HIDDEN BRAIN THAT YOU'VE SEEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR ON T-SHIRTS AVAILABLE AT THE NPR GIFT SHOP
POD0000003172_S0000202 I'M SHANKAR VEDANTAM
POD0000003180_S0000017 NEW PROFESSIONS DEMAND NEW SKILLS
POD0000003180_S0000023 YOU WERE LAID OFF
POD0000003180_S0000031 SHE AND OTHERS HAVE STUDIED WHY MANY MEN ARE NOT MOVING TO SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY THAT ARE BOOMING
POD0000003180_S0000036 BUT AS THE ECONOMY HAS STARTED TO BOOM IN AREAS TRADITIONALLY DOMINATED BY WOMEN
POD0000003180_S0000054 MY NAME IS ROBERT VAUGHN WHEN HE WAS TWENTY THREE ROBERT VAUGHN FACED A DILEMMA CONFORM TO NORMS OF MASCULINITY OR PURSUE A PROMISING CAREER IN A FIELD LONG DOMINATED BY WOMEN
POD0000003180_S0000068 HIS PLAN WAS TO GO TO COLLEGE
POD0000003180_S0000075 AND THEY SAID HOW DOES SAN DIEGO SOUND
POD0000003180_S0000090 SAID HEY YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD REALLY LOOK INTO NURSING
POD0000003180_S0000102 THEN IT BECOMES SOMETHING THAT WOMEN DO AND MEN WOULD PERHAPS HESITATE TO ENTER WHY IS THIS
POD0000003180_S0000111 FRESHMAN YEAR JENNIFER LIVED IN A COED DORM
POD0000003180_S0000125 I THINK WHAT I WAS MORE INCLINED TO DO WAS SAY
POD0000003180_S0000132 OTHERS MENTIONED TIMES WHEN THEY WORKED IN MALE-DOMINATED FIELDS AND WERE MADE TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE BY CO-WORKERS
POD0000003180_S0000143 MANHOOD IS SOMETHING THAT IS HARD TO EARN AND EASY TO LOSE
POD0000003180_S0000148 IN TERMS OF WHY THIS WOULD BE THE CASE
POD0000003180_S0000163 THEN THEY WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO CHOOSE AS THEIR NEXT TASK THE PUNCHING TASK
POD0000003180_S0000171 TO BE SURE IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT SOCIETAL MESSAGES THAT CONSTRAIN MEN HAVE OFTEN BEEN DEVELOPED BY MEN
POD0000003180_S0000180 REMEMBER THAT CLIP FROM MEET THE PARENTS NOT MANY MEN IN YOUR PROFESSION
POD0000003180_S0000196 ONE WOMAN IN PARTICULAR FELT CALLED TO ACTION
POD0000003180_S0000204 BACK HOME SHE CAME TO BE SEEN AS SOMETHING OF A TRAILBLAZER
POD0000003180_S0000211 AS HER METHODS SPREAD TO AUSTRALIA CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES
POD0000003180_S0000216 MEN WERE ONLY TWO PERCENT OF NURSES IN THE UNITED STATES
POD0000003180_S0000222 CAN YOU MAKE THE CLOCK TURN BACKWARDS
POD0000003180_S0000228 SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT JENNIFER PROPOSED WAS PRESENTED TO ROBERT VAUGHN
POD0000003180_S0000235 AND THEY WERE JUST VERY BELLIGERENT FIGHTING THERE WAS BLOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THEY WERE HAD TO BE SPLIT UP INTO DIFFERENT ROOMS
POD0000003180_S0000246 HIS WIFE CHRISTINE SAYS THAT WHEN HE WAS IN NURSING SCHOOL
POD0000003180_S0000259 THEY WERE LIKE
POD0000003180_S0000274 IT'S A LITTLE HURTFUL
POD0000003180_S0000282 BUT AS A MALE NURSE YOU HAVE AN ISSUE
POD0000003180_S0000293 STARTING CYCLING WITH A GROUP OF OTHER MALES GOING THROUGH NURSING SCHOOL WAS A STARTING POINT FOR HIM OF LIKE
POD0000003180_S0000300 DUMBBELLS A PULL-UP BAR
POD0000003180_S0000309 I THINK A LOT OF GUYS WHO MIGHT GO INTO HEALTH CARE ARE INTERESTED IN HEALTH AND FITNESS
POD0000003180_S0000317 MEEK OR
POD0000003180_S0000331 HE'S GROWN TO ADMIRE THE SKILLS HE ONCE CONSIDERED FEMININE MY THINKING ON THIS HAS EVOLVED TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN SAY
POD0000003180_S0000344 WHEN POLICYMAKERS TALK ABOUT INTERVENTIONS TO HELP THE JOBLESS FIND WORK THEY TALK ABOUT VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS AND RETRAINING SKILLS
POD0000003180_S0000350 THEY ARE STEREOTYPES
POD0000003180_S0000356 BUT IN THE END
POD0000003180_S0000362 WE HAD AUDIO ASSISTANCE FROM ANDY HUETHER OUR UNSUNG HERO TODAY IS MARILYN GEEWAX
POD0000003180_S0000368 WE KNOW THAT WE DO
POD0000003180_S0000374 EVER FEEL THAT PORNOGRAPHY IS BETTER THAN INTIMACY WITH AN ACTUAL PARTNER
POD0000003188_S0000010 WE FOLLOW THE WORK OF A RESEARCHER WHO WENT THERE
POD0000003188_S0000016 IAIN MCGILCHRIST IS A PSYCHIATRIST
POD0000003188_S0000021 IAIN'S BOOK ON THIS TOPIC HAS BEEN ON MY RADAR FOR MANY YEARS
POD0000003188_S0000028 YOU ARGUE IN THE BOOK THAT THERE HAS BEEN MANY OVERSIMPLIFICATIONS OF HOW THE TWO HEMISPHERES WORK AND WHAT THEIR DIFFERENT ROLES ARE
POD0000003188_S0000038 FISH
POD0000003188_S0000047 SURELY IT'S A VAST WASTE OF COMPUTING POWER TO HAVE THIS BRAIN DIVIDED INTO TWO BITS
POD0000003188_S0000052 IMAGINATION THERE
POD0000003188_S0000059 IAIN BELIEVES THE BRAIN IS DIVIDED INTO TWO HEMISPHERES SO THAT IT CAN PRODUCE TWO DIFFERENT VIEWS OF REALITY
POD0000003188_S0000064 IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE BIG PICTURE
POD0000003188_S0000071 SO YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO PRACTICE YOUR FINGERING AT BAR EIGHTEEN
POD0000003188_S0000084 ON THE ONE HAND IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE THE WORLD TO GET FOOD TO PICK UP A TWIG TO BUILD A NEST YOU NEED A VERY PRECISE
POD0000003188_S0000089 FRAGMENTED AND ENTIRELY DETAILED BUT SUSTAINED BROAD AND VIGILANT FOR PREDATORS AND FOR OTHER MEMBERS OF YOUR SPECIES
POD0000003188_S0000095 IT IS MUCH MORE LIKE A TRAFFIC SIGNAL IN ORDER TO COLLABORATE YOU NEED TO BOTH WORK TOGETHER AND WORK SEPARATELY
POD0000003188_S0000104 THE MASTER APPOINTS AN EMISSARY
POD0000003188_S0000110 AND BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW
POD0000003188_S0000116 HE MAKES AN ANALOGY ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HEMISPHERES I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I RESIST VERY STRONGLY THE IDEA THAT THE BRAIN IS A COMPUTER IT'S JUST NOTHING LIKE A COMPUTER ACTUALLY
POD0000003188_S0000123 I AM SUGGESTING THAT WE HAVE ARRIVED AT A PLACE
POD0000003188_S0000136 A SURGEON LITERALLY SPLIT HIS BRAIN IN TWO
POD0000003188_S0000146 BUT IT ALSO HAD THE CONSEQUENCE THAT BY CLEVER EXPERIMENTATION YOU COULD DELIVER INFORMATION TO ONE HEMISPHERE AT A TIME AND FIND OUT WHAT THAT HEMISPHERE KNEW AND HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT THESE EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THE LEFT AND RIGHT HEMISPHERE APPROACH EVERYDAY TASKS VERY DIFFERENTLY
POD0000003188_S0000154 THE OTHER
POD0000003188_S0000161 BUT YOUR LEFT HEMISPHERE IS WONDERING MEANWHILE WHY I'M SUPPLYING THIS QUITE UNNECESSARY METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
POD0000003188_S0000174 LITERAL MEANING HOWEVER IS A PERIPHERAL DIMINISHED VERSION OF THE RICHNESS OF METAPHORICAL UNDERSTANDING
POD0000003188_S0000182 WHICH ISN'T MADE UP OF SLICES OR CHUNKS OF RIVER THAT ARE THEN PUT TOGETHER
POD0000003188_S0000189 AND CALCULUS IS AN ATTEMPT ACTUALLY TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING WHICH IS INDIVISIBLE BY DIVIDING IT IN SLICES
POD0000003188_S0000198 SHE WANTS TO POISON
POD0000003188_S0000209 WITH ITS NARROW VIEW OF REALITY
POD0000003188_S0000215 HER LEFT HEMISPHERE IS STILL INTACT
POD0000003188_S0000220 I DON'T KNOW I FOUND IT IN MY BED HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN THERE
POD0000003188_S0000226 WHICH IS A FEATURE OF THE WAY THE LEFT HEMISPHERE WORKS
POD0000003188_S0000233 CAN YOU MOVE IT THEY SAY OH THAT'S NOT MINE THAT BELONGS TO YOU DOCTOR
POD0000003188_S0000242 AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T APPRECIATE THE STRUCTURE OF A SENTENCE THAT'S BEING SAID TO YOU
POD0000003188_S0000248 BROADLY SPEAKING
POD0000003188_S0000265 SO THERE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING GOING ON AT ALL LEVELS
POD0000003188_S0000270 ONE OBSERVATION IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT A SCORE OF A PIECE OF MUSIC IF YOU READ MUSIC AT ALL
POD0000003188_S0000279 YOU KNOW BY LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE PLAYING BUT YOU CAN ALSO ANALYZE IT ACOUSTICALLY YOU CAN SORT OF SAY HERE ARE THE DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES AND THE DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS AND HERE'S THE TEMPO AND THE BEAT AND SO FORTH
POD0000003188_S0000291 SO IT MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE BUT ALL THE REST IS GAPS IT'S THE GAPS BETWEEN THE NOTES THE GAPS THAT MAKE MELODY THE GAPS THAT MAKE HARMONY AND SO
POD0000003188_S0000303 HERE'S A CLIP FROM THE TV SHOW THE BIG BANG THEORY WHICH YOU MIGHT NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH IN BRITAIN
POD0000003188_S0000317 YOU CAN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND POETRY BY PARAPHRASING IT ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN EXPLAIN THE JOKE AND EXPECT IT STILL TO BE FUNNY AND THAT'S VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART BECAUSE I USED TO WORK IN THE AREA OF ENGLISH LITERATURE
POD0000003188_S0000329 AS WHEN THAT NIGHT SAW US ALIGHT
POD0000003188_S0000336 WITHOUT TEARS
POD0000003188_S0000345 THIS IS HIDDEN BRAIN I'M SHANKAR VEDANTAM
POD0000003188_S0000351 THE RIGHT WHAT KIND OF A WORLD WOULD THAT PRODUCE
POD0000003188_S0000357 THAT IT DOES FEEL SUFFERING
POD0000003188_S0000369 ANGER WOULD BECOME THE KEY NOTE IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE EVERYTHING WOULD BECOME BLACK AND WHITE THE LEFT HEMISPHERE NEEDS TO BE DECISIVE BECAUSE DON'T FORGET IT'S THE ONE THAT'S CATCHING THE PREY
POD0000003188_S0000376 THE SENSE OF SOCIAL ALIENATION
POD0000003188_S0000386 ONE OF THE UNUSUAL THINGS ABOUT IAIN'S BOOK IS THAT IT HAS DETAILED PASSAGES ABOUT NEUROSCIENCE FOLLOWED BY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF ART AND MUSIC AND LITERATURE
POD0000003188_S0000398 LITERATURE AND EVEN DOING A BIT OF PHILOSOPHY
POD0000003188_S0000412 NOW I LOOK AT THE RESEARCH I FIND ALL THESE THINGS AND YOU DON'T TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT AT ALL YOU'RE WRONG MATE
POD0000003188_S0000422 WE DON'T MOVE FROM A WORLD IN WHICH WE HAVE MODELS TO A BETTER ONE IN WHICH WE DON'T
POD0000003188_S0000433 AND IT'S REALLY A WAY TO SORT OF BRING BACK THE LEFT BRAIN RIGHT BRAIN POP PSYCHOLOGY THIS TIME WITH FMRI STUDIES DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT
POD0000003188_S0000438 I SAY TO THEM AT THE END YOU KNOW
POD0000003188_S0000446 YOU'VE SUDDENLY EXPLAINED
POD0000003188_S0000458 I LOVE SCIENCE SINCE A CHILD I WAS CAPTIVATED BY SCIENCE
POD0000003188_S0000467 THERE IS A DISTINCTION TO BE MADE BETWEEN RATIONALITY BY WHICH I MEAN THE MINDLESS FOLLOWING OUT OF RATIONALISTIC PROCEDURES AND WHAT I WOULD CALL REASON WHICH SINCE THE RENAISSANCE HAS BEEN EXALTED AS THE MARK OF A TRULY EDUCATED PERSON
POD0000003188_S0000476 IAIN MCGILCHRIST IS THE AUTHOR OF THE MASTER AND HIS EMISSARY THE DIVIDED BRAIN AND THE MAKING OF THE WESTERN WORLD
POD0000003188_S0000483 KEVIN BEESLEY READ THE THOMAS HARDY POEM
POD0000003188_S0000488 BECAUSE OF JUDE'S NOTE
POD0000003188_S0000494 I'M SHANKAR VEDANTAM
POD0000003196_S0000006 A CORONAVIRUS LEAPED FROM AN ANIMAL INTO A HUMAN
POD0000003196_S0000011 NO ONE OUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND HEARING ON THE INTERNET IS POLICE IN HAZMAT SUITS GOING DOOR TO DOOR
POD0000003196_S0000020 NEAR THE END OF FEBRUARY
POD0000003196_S0000026 PEOPLE RACE TO TRAIN STATIONS TRYING TO GET OUT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE FLEEING LOMBARDY BROUGHT THE VIRUS WITH THEM TO OTHER PARTS OF ITALY
POD0000003196_S0000034 INCLUDING WHETHER THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS REVEALED THE TRUE SCOPE OF THE OUTBREAK
POD0000003196_S0000040 FROM THE TIDINESS OF OUR HOMES TO OUR POLITICAL PREFERENCES TO OUR APPROACH TO STOPPING THE SPREAD OF A PANDEMIC
POD0000003196_S0000046 WHERE OTHERS MIGHT SEE ONLY POLICY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NATIONS IN HOW THEY RESPOND TO A PANDEMIC
POD0000003196_S0000052 DOES SHE CROSS THE ROAD
POD0000003196_S0000059 AND THEY SWIM ON
POD0000003196_S0000069 INCLUDING THINGS LIKE LITTERING OR SPITTING ON THE STREET THESE THINGS CAN BE STRICTLY PUNISHED IN SINGAPORE
POD0000003196_S0000080 WHEN THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ON TIME THEY HAVE TO REMIND THEMSELVES THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CULTURE
POD0000003196_S0000101 OR IF I LEAVE TOWELS ON THE BED I GET A LITTLE BIT OF FEEDBACK
POD0000003196_S0000111 MICHELE SAYS WE MIGHT NOT LIKE RULES
POD0000003196_S0000122 WHAT MICHELE IS TALKING ABOUT IS NOT JUST THE RULES WE HAVE BUT THE RULES WE HAVE ABOUT FOLLOWING THE RULES
POD0000003196_S0000130 YEAH YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT CULTURE EVOLVES FOR GOOD REASONS
POD0000003196_S0000138 BUT WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED IS THAT THAT GLUE IS STRONGER IN SOME CONTEXT THAN OTHERS
POD0000003196_S0000144 EVEN IN THE SAME SITUATION THINK ABOUT A LIBRARY
POD0000003196_S0000161 NOT HOW MUCH CONFLICT THEY'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN AROUND THE WORLD
POD0000003196_S0000170 TO COORDINATE AT A SCALE TO DEAL WITH THREAT FOR SURVIVAL
POD0000003196_S0000178 BUT WHAT WE FOUND WAS STRIKING IN THE HIGH POPULATION DENSITY CONDITION
POD0000003196_S0000184 MICHELE FINDS THAT ETHNIC DIVERSITY IS OFTEN A DRIVER OF CULTURAL LOOSENESS
POD0000003196_S0000190 AND COUNTRIES LIKE NEW ZEALAND BRAZIL THE NETHERLANDS AND GREECE TENDED TO VEER LOOSE
POD0000003196_S0000198 MY THEORY WOULD BE THAT ANY DOMAIN THAT'S REALLY SUPER IMPORTANT IN A COUNTRY EVOLVES TO BE TIGHT
POD0000003196_S0000212 IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT SOME OF THE SAME PREDICTORS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL ALSO EXPLAIN TIGHTNESS-LOOSENESS DIFFERENCES AT THE STATE LEVEL
POD0000003196_S0000218 NOW EVERY ONE OF THE TOP TEN TIGHTEST STATES IS RELIABLY REPUBLICAN IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND NINE OUT OF THE TEN LOOSER STATES IS RELIABLY DEMOCRATIC
POD0000003196_S0000228 BY CONTRAST
POD0000003196_S0000238 I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO A NEWS CLIP ABOUT THE STORY NO ONE KNEW WHEN IT WOULD TAKE PLACE
POD0000003196_S0000248 HE WAS CANED
POD0000003196_S0000261 AND THE SOUTH TENDS TO BE PRETTY TIGHT
POD0000003196_S0000286 AND SO THAT MEANS THAT THEY'RE MORE SELF-REGULATED
POD0000003196_S0000305 THAT'S RIGHT SO PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE OPEN TO PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT RACES RELIGIONS OF IMMIGRANTS
POD0000003196_S0000320 BUT WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAD SO MUCH CULTURAL CONFLICT
POD0000003196_S0000333 HAVE CULTURAL CONVERSATIONS HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CULTURE
POD0000003196_S0000341 AND IT HAS THE SAME ASSOCIATED TRADEOFFS
POD0000003196_S0000349 THE RESPONSE SO FAR ECHOES OUR LOOSE CULTURAL PROGRAMMING
POD0000003196_S0000365 IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE ON A DIME WHEN THE SITUATION AROUND US CHANGES
POD0000003196_S0000378 I HAD THE HUNCH THAT MAYBE IT'S NEITHER
POD0000003196_S0000386 SHE STUDIES HOW CULTURE SHAPES ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITIES AND NATIONS
POD0000003196_S0000392 RHAINA COHEN
POD0000003196_S0000398 FOR OUR INTERVIEW WHICH NEEDED TWO PHONES
POD0000003196_S0000404 FOR MORE HIDDEN BRAIN YOU CAN FIND US ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER
POD0000003204_S0000013 I THINK YOU'LL REALLY ENJOY
POD0000003204_S0000023 MAYBE YOU'VE GONE ON VACATION TO SOME FAR-FLUNG LOCALE AND MET SOMEONE WHO LIVES DOWN THE STREET FROM YOU
POD0000003204_S0000033 WITHIN THOSE STORIES WE FOUND TWO THAT THEMSELVES FORMED A COINCIDENCE
POD0000003204_S0000040 SHE CALLED US ON A SCRATCHY PHONE LINE FROM PARIS
POD0000003204_S0000046 AS MY FATHER
POD0000003204_S0000056 SHOULD I FORGIVE HIM
POD0000003204_S0000067 LAUREN WAS TOUCHED BY HOW MUCH COMPASSION HE SEEMED TO HAVE FOR HER
POD0000003204_S0000080 AND EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT
POD0000003204_S0000090 ERIC IN FACT HAD A FLAIR FOR THE ROMANTIC BRINGING HER ROSES COMFORTING HER WITH HER FAVORITE MOVIE AFTER A TOUGH DAY
POD0000003204_S0000105 ERIC'S SISTER
POD0000003204_S0000116 YOU KNOW I WAS HITTING A NERVE ON COINCIDENCES IN THE END THOUGH JOSEPH DID WRITE HIS BOOK IT'S CALLED FLUKE THE MATH AND MYTH OF COINCIDENCE
POD0000003204_S0000122 ARE ALL BASICALLY THE SAME TYPE OF COINCIDENCE
POD0000003204_S0000131 THIRTEEN YEARS LATER
POD0000003204_S0000139 THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY
POD0000003204_S0000144 SO IF YOU ASK THE QUESTION SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY NOT WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT JOAN GINTHER WILL WIN THE LOTTERY FOUR TIMES
POD0000003204_S0000157 JOSEPH TOLD ME ONE OF HIS FAVORITE STORIES ABOUT A NINETEENTH CENTURY FRENCH POET
POD0000003204_S0000174 AND HE ENTERS HE'S AN OLD MAN BY NOW
POD0000003204_S0000189 I'M FASCINATED BY COINCIDENCES AND COULD LISTEN FOR HOURS TO STORIES ABOUT THEM
POD0000003204_S0000195 EPLEY'S BOOK EXAMINES HOW WE READ THE MENTAL STATES AND INTENTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE
POD0000003204_S0000201 BUT WE GIVE HURRICANES A NAME KATRINA
POD0000003204_S0000214 LIKE YOU COULDN'T ANTICIPATE ITS ACTIONS
POD0000003204_S0000222 NOW IT WANTS TO GO OVER THERE A LITTLE BIT
POD0000003204_S0000237 HE'S SAYING WE DRAW THE WRONG CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THESE STREAKS LET'S IMAGINE THAT THEY'RE A GOOD SHOOTER AND THEY SHOOT FIFTY PERCENT FROM THE FIELD
POD0000003204_S0000250 TO ME IT FEELS LIKE IT'S A SIGN OF SOMETHING BUT IF I WERE TO TELL YOU I SAY NICK YOU KNOW THIS HAPPENED TO ME YESTERDAY YOU'D SAY YEAH SURE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ONCE EVERY MONTH OR SO IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT IF YOU BELIEVE THE LAWS OF PROBABILITY
POD0000003204_S0000261 EVENTUALLY WE HAVE TO GIVE IN TO THE LAWS OF PROBABILITY THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN EXPLAIN THAT RIGHT
POD0000003204_S0000275 AND WE CALLED EACH OTHER BIRTHDAY TWINS
POD0000003204_S0000284 JEANETTA ALSO FINDS HERSELF DRAWN TO PEOPLE WHO HAPPEN TO HAVE THE SAME NAME WHEN I MEET ANOTHER JEANETTA
POD0000003204_S0000297 MAYBE EVEN BENEFICIAL A SIGN OF GOOD SELF-ESTEEM
POD0000003204_S0000307 AND WE LOOKED AT ALL OF THEM THERE'RE ELEVEN OF THEM THAT ARE PRETTY COMMON
POD0000003204_S0000321 YOU SHOULD THINK OF IMPLICIT EGOTISM AS A TINY INVISIBLE NUDGE
POD0000003204_S0000328 YOU MAY NOT BE CONSCIOUSLY CHOOSING THINGS AS IMPORTANT AS YOUR SPOUSE OR YOUR PROFESSION OR THE PLACE YOU CALL HOME BASED ON ARBITRARY FACTORS LIKE YOUR NAME OR YOUR BIRTHDAY
POD0000003204_S0000337 YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HATE THAT PRODUCT
POD0000003204_S0000357 HOW DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER
POD0000003204_S0000369 IN GENERAL WE TEND TO PREFER THINGS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH US
POD0000003204_S0000376 HE LOOKED AT IMPLICIT RACIAL BIAS
POD0000003204_S0000388 IN FACT IF YOU GO ONLINE
POD0000003204_S0000395 THEN THEY ASKED THE VOLUNTEERS
POD0000003204_S0000402 PEOPLE WHO SPENT TIME AND EFFORT BUILDING SOMETHING FELT PROUD OF WHAT THEY'D BUILT
POD0000003204_S0000420 SO ONCE COMPETENCE WASN'T THAT IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE
POD0000003204_S0000433 JUST AS WE CAN BE DRAWN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY AS US OR THE SAME NAME AS US
POD0000003204_S0000438 YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT EVIDENCE THAT YOU MADE A MISTAKE
POD0000003204_S0000445 OUR ENGINEERS ARE ANDY HUETHER AND JAY SCIZ
POD0000003212_S0000009 KATE DESCRIBES THE MOMENT SHE FIRST GAZED UP CLOSE AT A LIFE-SIZE SILICONE WOMAN THE DETAIL IS INCREDIBLE
POD0000003212_S0000017 AS THE GAP BETWEEN HUMANS AND MACHINES NARROWS
POD0000003212_S0000029 WELCOME TO HIDDEN BRAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME ON I WANT TO START WITH HOW SOMEONE BECOMES A ROBO-SEXOLOGIST I UNDERSTAND FOR YOU IT BEGAN WITH HANGING OUT IN A PUB WITH A BUNCH OF PHILOSOPHERS IT REALLY DID YES I WAS AT A CONFERENCE
POD0000003212_S0000036 THAT COULD FEEL THE THINGS WE FEEL
POD0000003212_S0000045 THIS TALE IS ABOUT A WOMAN NAMED LAODAMIA WHOSE HUSBAND WAS KILLED DURING THE TROJAN WAR SO I WORKED WITH A CLASSICIST A FRIEND OF MINE DR GENEVIEVE LIVELEY
POD0000003212_S0000057 THERE'S DEFINITELY A LONGSTANDING NARRATIVE OF THAT
POD0000003212_S0000079 WHEN KATE DEVLIN VISITED ABYSS CREATIONS THE COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURES WHAT IT CALLS REALDOLLS SHE WAS CURIOUS BUT ALSO CONCERNED I WENT THERE THINKING
POD0000003212_S0000087 THE SILICONE IS IT DEFORMS QUITE EASILY SO IF YOU LEAVE ONE OF THESE DOLLS SITTING IN THE SAME POSITION
POD0000003212_S0000109 WE WANT DOLLS THAT HAVE A LOVER'S MIND
POD0000003212_S0000128 SO THEY WANTED TO GIVE HARMONY AN ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT PERSONALITY
POD0000003212_S0000134 I'D LIKE HER TO BE A LITTLE MORE FLIRTY
POD0000003212_S0000157 BUT LOVING A SILICONE LIFE-SIZED WOMAN OR AN OPERATING SYSTEM WITH A SEXY FEMALE VOICE THAT'S ANOTHER STORY
POD0000003212_S0000174 AND THEN THAT WOULD STOP THEM OFFENDING IN REAL LIFE
POD0000003212_S0000180 WHERE SOMEONE ACTUALLY HARMS YOU
POD0000003212_S0000193 THERE ARE SCENES WHERE SAMANTHA THE OPERATING SYSTEM
POD0000003212_S0000212 SHE'S ALSO THE AUTHOR OF TURNED ON SCIENCE SEX AND ROBOTS
POD0000003212_S0000222 I SPENT A COUPLE OF HOURS IN MUIR WOODS
POD0000003212_S0000227 SHE IS A CONSUMMATE STORYTELLER WEAVING SCIENCE AND HISTORY AND HER LOVE FOR THE REDWOODS INTO A GRIPPING AND MOVING TALE
POD0000003212_S0000232 FOR MORE HIDDEN BRAIN YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER
POD0000003220_S0000019 SHE'S A NEUROSCIENTIST WHO STUDIES THE SCIENCE OF LAUGHTER
POD0000003220_S0000040 SOPHIE
POD0000003220_S0000059 AND LAUGHTER CAN BE LIKE THAT AS WELL IT CAN JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S ISSUING FORTH FROM US AND WE CAN MAKE SOUNDS WHEN WE'RE LAUGHING LIKE THAT THAT PROBABLY
POD0000003220_S0000067 I GOT INTO LAUGHTER BY BEING INTERESTED IN NONVERBAL VOCALIZATIONS SO SOMETHING LIKE ME GOING OH WHEN I'M SURPRISED OR SCREAMING IN TERROR
POD0000003220_S0000090 HE FOUND THAT THE MORE YOU TICKLE A BABY RAT WHEN IT'S A BABY
POD0000003220_S0000097 ACTUALLY THAT'S HARDER FOR YOU TO MANAGE
POD0000003220_S0000118 IT STOPS US TALKING YOU HEARD THEY WERE COMPLETELY UNABLE TO KEEP SPEAKING
POD0000003220_S0000144 HERE'S HOW IT USUALLY GOES
POD0000003220_S0000160 WELL IT TURNS OUT LAUGHTER OFTEN ISN'T ABOUT RESPONDING TO HUMOR
POD0000003220_S0000173 I WANT TO PLAY YOU A CLIP FROM THE TV SHOW SEINFELD
POD0000003220_S0000221 LAUGHTER IN OTHER WORDS CAN TELL US A LOT ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PEOPLE
POD0000003220_S0000227 SHE INVITED THEM INTO A STRANGE LITTLE HUT
POD0000003220_S0000233 AN EXPERIENCE FEW PEOPLE COULD TOLERATE FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES
POD0000003220_S0000240 HER QUESTION WOULD THE BRAIN REGISTER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAUGHTER THAT WAS POLITE AND LAUGHTER THAT WAS SPONTANEOUS
POD0000003220_S0000248 FOR SOPHIE THE EXPERIMENT CONFIRMED THAT LAUGHTER ALWAYS MEANS SOMETHING
POD0000003220_S0000257 HE PULLED OUT ALL THE MOMENTS WHEN THEY LAUGHED
POD0000003220_S0000263 AND HERE'S ANOTHER
POD0000003220_S0000277 THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN THE ROLE OF LAUGHTER TOOK CENTER STAGE
POD0000003220_S0000287 YOU'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT LAUGHTER YOU'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN THEM LAUGHING AT YOU
POD0000003220_S0000298 SO WE NORMALLY DWELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THAT LOOK WE'RE MAKING AND MAINTAINING SOCIAL BONDS AND THAT'S GREAT BUT IF YOU ARE EXCLUDED FROM THAT YOU'RE EXCLUDED FROM THAT LAUGHTER IT'S AWFUL
POD0000003220_S0000317 TRUMP WAS TALKING ABOUT THE WOMAN HE WAS ABOUT TO MEET YEAH THAT'S HER WITH THE GOLD
POD0000003220_S0000337 BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT BOSSES WHO MIGHT HAVE GOT USED TO PEOPLE LAUGHING AT WHAT THEY SAY
POD0000003220_S0000345 LAUGHTER CAN BE A SLY WAY TO UNDERMINE LEADERS AND REGISTER DISCONTENT
POD0000003220_S0000370 AND THE FIRST TIME I GOT A LAUGH AND IT WASN'T A LAUGH I WAS EXPECTING
POD0000003220_S0000395 SOPHIE SCOTT IS A NEUROSCIENTIST AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON WHERE SHE STUDIES THE SCIENCE OF LAUGHTER
POD0000003220_S0000405 HIS GREEN BAY PACKERS FOOTBALL TEAM AND SUNSETS
POD0000003220_S0000415 I LOVE TO BE TICKLED
POD0000003228_S0000010 AT SCHOOL JAMES MONROE HIGH SCHOOL ALSO IN THE BRONX
POD0000003228_S0000018 PHIL BECAME FAMOUS FOR CONDUCTING THE STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENT WHERE HE TURNED THE UNIVERSITY'S PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT INTO A MAKESHIFT PRISON
POD0000003228_S0000023 THE STUDY HAS INVITED A GREAT DEAL OF ADMIRATION AND A GREAT DEAL OF CRITICISM OVER THE YEARS
POD0000003228_S0000028 ONCE IT'S DONE
POD0000003228_S0000041 HE COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THE WAR AND ITS IMPLICATIONS
POD0000003228_S0000052 HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW YOU WOULD ACT UNLESS YOU'RE IN THE SITUATION
POD0000003228_S0000058 STANLEY DECIDED TO TEST THIS IDEA UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS WOULD A PERSON OBEY AUTHORITY WHO COMMANDED ACTIONS THAT WENT AGAINST CONSCIENCE
POD0000003228_S0000064 HE CAME UP WITH A SCENARIO THAT WAS SIMPLE
POD0000003228_S0000072 WE SHOULD NOTE THAT SOME LISTENERS MAY FIND THIS SECTION UPSETTING BECAUSE IT INVOLVES DESCRIPTIONS OF SOMEONE INFLICTING PAIN ON ANOTHER PERSON
POD0000003228_S0000077 SECOND
POD0000003228_S0000083 THE EXPERIMENTER BEGAN BY EXPLAINING THE PURPOSE OF THE MEMORY TEST WE WANT TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT EFFECT DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE ON EACH OTHER AS TEACHERS AND LEARNERS AND ALSO WHAT EFFECT PUNISHMENT WILL HAVE ON LEARNING IN THIS SITUATION THE EXPERIMENTER TOLD THE PERSON PLAYING THE ROLE OF STUDENT TO SIT IN A CHAIR
POD0000003228_S0000089 NICE DAY
POD0000003228_S0000098 NEXT
POD0000003228_S0000105 TRY AND REMEMBER THE WORD PAIRS
POD0000003228_S0000111 YOU'LL NOW GET A SHOCK OF SEVENTY FIVE VOLTS OH
POD0000003228_S0000119 PLEASE CONTINUE THE NEXT WORD IS SAD HI HELLO
POD0000003228_S0000132 THE MEMORY TEST BECAME MORE DEMANDING NEXT ONE
POD0000003228_S0000144 HE BREAKING
POD0000003228_S0000154 IN THIS VERSION MANY OF THE VOLUNTEERS PLAYING THE ROLE OF TEACHER SHOWED DISCOMFORT BUT CONTINUED WITH THE EXPERIMENT
POD0000003228_S0000161 THE ONLY TARGET OF THE EXPERIMENT WERE THE VOLUNTEERS WHO PLAYED THE ROLE OF TEACHER
POD0000003228_S0000166 LOOK
POD0000003228_S0000172 THEY QUESTION WHETHER THE VOLUNTEERS ACTUALLY BEHAVED THE WAY THE EXPERIMENT SUGGESTED
POD0000003228_S0000179 ARE SUCH PEOPLE TYPICAL
POD0000003228_S0000186 BUT VANESSA BOHNS A PSYCHOLOGIST AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY
POD0000003228_S0000192 VANESSA ASKED A DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE QUESTION WAS HE SURPRISED TO SEE THESE PEOPLE GOING ALONG WITH THIS CRAZY REQUEST HE WAS MAKING OF THEM
POD0000003228_S0000208 WE AUTOMATICALLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE SHOES OF THE VOLUNTEERS
POD0000003228_S0000214 THE ONE THING WE DON'T ASK
POD0000003228_S0000224 VANESSA NO LONGER REMEMBERS WHAT THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ABOUT
POD0000003228_S0000232 ASKING THEM TO STOP DOING WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND TO DO SOMETHING SHE WANTED THEM TO DO
POD0000003228_S0000239 YOU KNOW
POD0000003228_S0000246 ONCE THERE SHE AND HER PROFESSOR FRANK FLYNN
POD0000003228_S0000254 IF LOTS OF PEOPLE SAID YES
POD0000003228_S0000260 SHE REALIZED THAT SHE HAD A BIG EFFECT ON OTHER PEOPLE
POD0000003228_S0000267 GO OUT AND ACTUALLY ASK PEOPLE
POD0000003228_S0000272 SHE REALIZED THIS MIGHT BE WHY EVERYONE ALWAYS SAW THE EXPERIMENT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE VOLUNTEERS ASKED TO ADMINISTER SHOCKS THE PEOPLE BEING INFLUENCED
POD0000003228_S0000278 YOU KNOW THE EXPERIMENTER SAYING YOU KNOW YOU MUST SHOCK THIS OTHER PERSON
POD0000003228_S0000285 THEY HAD TO WEIGH WHETHER TO PUT ASIDE WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND HELP HER FOR A FEW MINUTES
POD0000003228_S0000290 IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT MANY OF US ARE INFLUENCED BY SITUATIONS
POD0000003228_S0000298 I'M SURE THIS PERSON IS GOING TO TURN DOWN MY REQUEST
POD0000003228_S0000309 THEY HAVE ALL THESE CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW
POD0000003228_S0000319 HER PARTICIPANTS DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD TO ASK TO REACH THEIR GOAL
POD0000003228_S0000327 JOHN ASKED ME TO IMAGINE THE SCENARIO FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PERSON RECEIVING THE REQUEST
POD0000003228_S0000335 OTHERS WERE NOT TOLD AHEAD OF TIME
POD0000003228_S0000345 IN THE CASE OF THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL FUNDRAISER FOR EXAMPLE WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT ROUGHLY THREE-QUARTERS OF THE DOLLARS GIVEN ARE DUE TO SOCIAL PRESSURE
POD0000003228_S0000351 WHAT THE RESEARCHERS FOUND WAS SIMILAR TO JOHN'S DONATION STUDY THEY MEASURED HOW FAR AWAY PEOPLE WALKED FROM THE BOOTH AS THEY WALKED BY THIS PATH
POD0000003228_S0000356 THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO THE STORY THEY GRABBED THAT HEADSET AND THEY THREW IT ACROSS THE ROOM WHEN WE COME BACK
POD0000003228_S0000363 THEIR EMBARRASSMENTS AND THEIR FEARS
POD0000003228_S0000372 THE VOLUNTEERS WERE ASKING PEOPLE TO TELL A TRIVIAL LIE
POD0000003228_S0000379 WILL YOU PLEASE JUST WRITE PICKLE IN THIS LIBRARY BOOK IN PEN
POD0000003228_S0000392 WE SHARE THE ANSWERS TO OUR HOMEWORK WITH A FRIEND WHO ASKED TO SEE OUR WORK
POD0000003228_S0000398 I NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO MY JOB AND YOU'RE AFFECTING MY ABILITY TO DO MY JOB
POD0000003228_S0000407 THEY WOULD ACTUALLY TELL THEM HEY HURRY UP AND GO GRAB IT SO THAT YOU CAN PLUG BACK IN AND CLEAR THIS AIRCRAFT FOR LANDING
POD0000003228_S0000418 ANNA WAS NO LONGER A TRAINEE
POD0000003228_S0000431 THIS PLANE WOULD HAVE DESCENDED
POD0000003228_S0000439 MAYBE THAT WAS THE CASE HERE
POD0000003228_S0000451 THE TENDENCY WE HAVE TO DOWNPLAY THE INFLUENCE WE HAVE ON OTHERS CAN HAVE FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES
POD0000003228_S0000461 THEN DO YOU REALLY WANT TO ASK THEM FOR THINGS BUT PEOPLE ARE REALLY GOOD AT JUSTIFYING THEIR BEHAVIORS IN WAYS THAT MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES
POD0000003228_S0000473 I'VE SEEN VIDEO OF THAT STUDY MANY TIMES AND ALWAYS FOUND THE SCENE FUNNY ONE TO FIFTEEN PEOPLE JUST STARING OFF INTO THE SKY
POD0000003228_S0000478 DID THEY EXPECT SO MANY PEOPLE TO JOIN THEM IN LOOKING AT NOTHING
POD0000003228_S0000484 THE FORCE WE COLLECTIVELY EXERT CAN BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE PERSON TO OVERCOME
POD0000003228_S0000489 THE EFFECTS CAN BE MONSTROUS
POD0000003228_S0000495 OUR VOICE ACTORS FOR THIS EPISODE WERE JACOB CONRAD
POD0000003228_S0000501 HER CAREFUL PLANNING HELPS US REACH A DIVERSE AUDIENCE
POD0000003228_S0000506 IF THEY ARE NEW TO PODCASTING
POD0000003236_S0000015 BOTH MEN WERE NAMED MICHAEL DAVIS
POD0000003236_S0000020 MIKKI HEBL SENT OUT FRIEND REQUESTS ON BEHALF OF THESE FICTITIOUS CHARACTERS TO MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN A BIG AMERICAN CITY
POD0000003236_S0000026 USING SIMILAR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
POD0000003236_S0000032 WHERE OUR ACTIONS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT MANY MORE PEOPLE
POD0000003236_S0000037 SO FOR EVERY HUNDRED REPLIES THAT A WHITE-SOUNDING NAME GOT
POD0000003236_S0000047 DURING THE LONG VOYAGE SHE SAYS
POD0000003236_S0000053 AND SO YOU BEGIN TO SEE WHERE THIS VERY SUBTLE TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION CAN BE VERY SYSTEMIC
POD0000003236_S0000060 SO I ASKED HIDDEN BRAIN PRODUCERS MAGGIE PENMAN AND MAX NESTERAK TO TAKE A FEW WEEKS AND TRY TO FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY SUCH BIASES THEY DECIDED TO FOCUS ON AN IMPORTANT NEW PART OF THE SHARING ECONOMY
POD0000003236_S0000066 GREAT YOU THINK ALL SET BUT THEN YOU GET AN EMAIL WE'RE SORRY BUT THE DATES YOU JUST BOOKED AREN'T AVAILABLE AFTER ALL THEY WERE LISTED BY MISTAKE NOW IF THIS HAPPENED TO YOU ONCE YOU MIGHT CHALK IT UP TO A WEIRD WEBSITE GLITCH
POD0000003236_S0000073 BUT I GOT SUSPICIOUS WHEN I WOULD CHECK BACK LIKE DAYS LATER AND SEE THAT THOSE DATES WERE STILL AVAILABLE QUIRTINA'S BLACK
POD0000003236_S0000089 IT'S UNLIKELY THAT MOST HOSTS ARE SAYING TO THEMSELVES I'M GOING TO REJECT THIS PERSON BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO RENT TO A BLACK PERSON I MEAN MAYBE SOME PEOPLE ARE INTENTIONALLY DISCRIMINATING THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME PEOPLE LIKE THAT
POD0000003236_S0000097 HAVE BENEFITED QUITE A BIT FROM OUR PLATFORM
POD0000003236_S0000110 AND SHE SAID ABSOLUTELY
POD0000003236_S0000117 I WAS THE ONLY WHITE PERSON ON THE BUS AND IT WAS ALL THESE BLACK PEOPLE
POD0000003236_S0000124 YOU KNOW THE OTHER WAY
POD0000003236_S0000142 THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE GREAT DISPARITIES THE LATEST TWIST ON THE AGE-OLD PROBLEM OF CABS THAT DON'T STOP TO PICK UP BLACK PEOPLE
POD0000003236_S0000154 AND IT CAN ALSO BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR HOSTS LET'S SAY YOU'RE RENTING OUT YOUR WHOLE HOME
POD0000003236_S0000161 THAT'S THE RESEARCHER AT HARVARD
POD0000003236_S0000166 THEY FOUND THAT MANY AUDITIONS HAD SWITCHED TO BEING BLIND WHICH MEANT JUDGES HAD GONE FROM WATCHING THE PERFORMERS TO JUST LISTENING TO THEM PLAY FROM BEHIND A SCREEN
POD0000003236_S0000175 YEAH SO IN ADDITION TO BUILDING UP THAT INSTANT BOOK OPTION THEY'RE ALSO ASKING EVERYONE WHO USES THE PLATFORM TO COMMIT TO A STRONGER NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY
POD0000003236_S0000189 HEY LISTENERS QUICK REQUEST
POD0000003236_S0000196 AND THE NEXT MORNING WE ARE INVITING YOU TO SKIP THE CABLE NEWS HANGOVER AND GET CAUGHT UP WITH US
POD0000003244_S0000005 BUT SHE HAD NEVER HEARD A STORY LIKE THIS ONE
POD0000003244_S0000014 THEIR MOTHER IS A SEAMSTRESS WHO LIVES IN THE CITY THE SCENE WAS QUITE CHAOTIC THE HOSPITAL STAFF IS TIRED AND OVERWORKED IT WAS APPROACHING CHRISTMASTIME
POD0000003244_S0000021 EACH FAMILY THINKS THEIR TWINS ARE FRATERNAL
POD0000003244_S0000027 IT BROUGHT UP FASCINATING QUESTIONS
POD0000003244_S0000035 AND WE'LL ALSO FIND OUT WHY TWIN STUDIES CAN ACT AS A NATURAL EXPERIMENT TO TEST SOME OF THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS ABOUT HUMAN NATURE
POD0000003244_S0000040 INSIGHTS AND PROVOCATIONS FROM TWIN STUDIES THIS WEEK ON HIDDEN BRAIN
POD0000003244_S0000046 ACCIDENTAL BROTHERS THE STORY OF TWINS EXCHANGED AT BIRTH AND THE POWER OF NATURE AND NURTURE
POD0000003244_S0000053 ARE YOU SURE YOUR TWINS AND HOW COULD YOU HAVE TWO BOYS THAT LOOK SO DIFFERENT
POD0000003244_S0000060 EVENTUALLY MOVED TO BOGOTA AND GET JOBS BEHIND THE COUNTER AT A BUTCHER SHOP
POD0000003244_S0000069 AND HER FIRST IMPULSE WAS
POD0000003244_S0000075 AND FINALLY HE SAID MY NAME IS WILLIAM
POD0000003244_S0000080 JORGE STARES AT THE IMAGE ON LAURA'S PHONE
POD0000003244_S0000086 THE SCENE IS CAPTURED ON SOMEONE'S PHONE
POD0000003244_S0000094 THEY ARE LIKE MIRROR IMAGES BOTH HANDSOME WITH DELICATE FEATURES
POD0000003244_S0000106 THEY HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS
POD0000003244_S0000112 AND HERE'S SOMETHING I'VE LEFT OUT OF THE STORY WILBER WAS ALSO AT THE SQUARE THAT NIGHT WATCHING FROM THE SIDELINES
POD0000003244_S0000119 IT MEANT HIS BROTHER WAS NOT HIS REAL BROTHER
POD0000003244_S0000124 THEY BOTH LIKED SIMILAR TYPES OF GIRLFRIENDS
POD0000003244_S0000132 WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THERE ARE TWO WAYS THEY COULD HAVE HANDLED THIS ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETE DESPAIR
POD0000003244_S0000140 YES
POD0000003244_S0000145 AS DO WILLIAM AND WILBER NOW WILLIAM AND WILBER WERE IN THE ARMY TOGETHER
POD0000003244_S0000152 AND THEY MET WHEN THEY WERE THIRTY NINE YEARS OLD
POD0000003244_S0000160 AND THEN ONE OF THE JIM TWINS DIVORCED BETTY AND MARRIED SANDY
POD0000003244_S0000176 WE DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE
POD0000003244_S0000183 AND IF YOU FIND MATCHED UNUSUAL HABITS MORE OFTEN IN IDENTICAL TWINS THAN YOU DO IN FRATERNAL TWINS
POD0000003244_S0000189 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE OTHER ONE THAT JUST SET THEM OFF
POD0000003244_S0000199 IDENTICAL TWINS RESULT WHEN A SINGLE FERTILIZED EGG DIVIDES SOMETIME BETWEEN THE FIRST AND FOURTEENTH DAY AFTER CONCEPTION
POD0000003244_S0000206 AND IN VIRTUALLY EVERY STUDY THAT I'VE SEEN
POD0000003244_S0000213 THERE HAD BEEN A LOT OF STUDIES IN BOTH OF THOSE AREAS AND WE FIND THAT FOR INTELLIGENCE GENERAL ABILITY
POD0000003244_S0000220 ABOUT HALF THOSE DIFFERENCES ARE EXPLAINED BY THE GENETIC DIFFERENCES AMONG THE PEOPLE
POD0000003244_S0000229 AND THEN WHEN I WENT BACK TO SEE THEM AGAIN IN THEIR YOUNG ADULT YEARS IT TURNED OUT THAT THE TALLER TWIN WAS SEVEN INCHES TALLER THAN THE OTHER ONE SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD A LASTING IMPRINT ON THESE STILL IDENTICAL GENES
POD0000003244_S0000236 HE WAS BORN TO THE CITY MOTHER BUT RAISED ON A FARM
POD0000003244_S0000246 AND BY THE TIME HE DISCOVERED THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS ORIGIN
POD0000003244_S0000252 NOW
POD0000003244_S0000259 CARLOS WAS THE OTHER BROTHER WHO GREW UP IN THE WRONG HOME
POD0000003244_S0000265 FOR AN ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE
POD0000003244_S0000270 UNDERLYING MANY OF THESE DEBATES IS AN UNEASE IF GENES DETERMINE OUR INTELLIGENCE AND PERSONALITY
POD0000003244_S0000279 WHY BOTHER WITH PUBLIC EDUCATION
POD0000003244_S0000286 BUT EVERYBODY CAN IMPROVE EVERYBODY CAN DEVELOP NEW SKILLS AND GET BETTER AT THAT
POD0000003244_S0000292 NATURE AND NURTURE REALLY ARE INEXTRICABLY INTERTWINED YES EXACTLY
POD0000003244_S0000299 WE ARE THE ONES WHO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WE WILL DO HOW HARD WE WILL WORK
POD0000003244_S0000306 AND WE ARE VERY DIFFERENT IN OUR OUTLOOKS IN OUR APPEARANCE IN OUR TALENTS BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF FAMILY LOYALTY AND I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY
POD0000003244_S0000315 OUR UNSUNG HERO TODAY IS LUIS CLEMENS
POD0000003244_S0000321 WHERE WE NOW CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE BEFORE HIM
POD0000003264_S0000006 ALL RIGHT SO THIS WEEKEND I FOUND THIS BOOK AND IT'S CALLED IT'S MINE
POD0000003264_S0000015 THEN A FLOOD SWALLOWS UP THE ISLAND THERE WAS ONLY ONE ROCK LEFT AND THERE THE FROGS HUDDLED TREMBLING FROM COLD AND FRIGHT
POD0000003264_S0000025 READING AND PRONUNCIATION
POD0000003264_S0000037 OFTEN HAVE THEIR BEGINNINGS IN THE DISTANT PAST SOMETIMES IN OUR CHILDHOODS
POD0000003264_S0000043 RAJ WELCOME TO HIDDEN BRAIN
POD0000003264_S0000051 CERTAINLY I WAS EXPOSED TO INEQUALITY
POD0000003264_S0000058 THESE ARE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE FACED A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND THAT WAS JUST EVIDENT
POD0000003264_S0000065 DO YOU DO BETTER AS MEASURED BY STANDARDIZED TESTS
POD0000003264_S0000070 MY PERFORMANCE ON STANDARDIZED TESTS BASICALLY LOOKS COMPARABLE TO OTHER KIDS WHO WERE IN DIFFERENT CLASSES SO THAT I THINK THAT FADE-OUT PATTERN LED TO A LOT OF DISCOURAGEMENT AMONG EDUCATION RESEARCHERS
POD0000003264_S0000078 THE STUDENTS IN THIS EXPERIMENT HAD BEEN RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENT KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS WITHIN THEIR SCHOOLS
POD0000003264_S0000084 SO WHAT THIS ALLOWS YOU TO DO IS GO BEYOND ASKING WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS OF THESE INTERVENTIONS ON TEST SCORES AND ASK
POD0000003264_S0000091 ARE DOING SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AS ADULTS SHOWING THAT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION DOES IN FACT HAVE LASTING IMPACTS
POD0000003264_S0000098 THAT WE PUT OUT IN THAT PAPER
POD0000003264_S0000103 IT TURNS OUT THAT CREDENTIALS
POD0000003264_S0000108 HOW YOU GO ABOUT MEASURING THOSE THINGS SYSTEMATICALLY I THINK IS A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW CAN WE THEN PERHAPS TRAIN TEACHERS TO DO BETTER ON THOSE DIMENSIONS THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE
POD0000003264_S0000123 IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT CORRELATES MORE STRONGLY WITH LATER OUTCOMES IN ADULTHOOD
POD0000003264_S0000129 SOMEONE WHO GETS ALONG WELL WITH THEIR PEERS OR SOMEONE WHO SCORES VERY HIGH ON MATH TESTS
POD0000003264_S0000135 HOW THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU LIVE IN COULD BE AN ENGINE FOR SUCCESS OR A BRAKE ON YOUR AMBITIONS
POD0000003264_S0000150 BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE ARGUED THE AMERICAN DREAM IS UNRAVELING THE AMERICAN DREAM
POD0000003264_S0000155 WHAT ARE YOUR ODDS OF REACHING THE TOP FIFTH OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION MAKING THAT LEAP FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP
POD0000003264_S0000165 TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS WORK
POD0000003264_S0000175 BLACK MEN WHO GROW UP IN LOW-INCOME FAMILIES IN WATTS ON AVERAGE HAVE EARNINGS OF ONLY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN THEIR MID THIRTY S AND THAT IS THE AVERAGE RIGHT SO THAT MEANS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE MEN HAVE INCOMES VERY CLOSE TO ZERO THEY'RE NONWORKING AND SO FORTH
POD0000003264_S0000184 IF YOU GO A MILE OR TWO AWAY TO COMPTON
POD0000003264_S0000195 HE'S ALSO NOTICED SOME OTHER PATTERNS WE FIND THAT THERE'S A VERY STRONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THESE OUTCOMES AND MEASURES OF FAMILY STRUCTURE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD
POD0000003264_S0000202 WILL SOMEONE ELSE HELP YOU OUT EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT DOING WELL
POD0000003264_S0000210 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TESTED THIS VERY IDEA WITH A PROGRAM CALLED MOVING TO OPPORTUNITY THIS IS MORNING EDITION I'M BOB EDWARDS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CONDUCTING AN EXPERIMENT IT'S HELPING POOR PEOPLE FROM FIVE CITIES MOVE INTO MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS
POD0000003264_S0000215 BUT RAJ DID EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD DONE WITH THE CLASSROOM STUDIES
POD0000003264_S0000225 WE WENT BACK TO THE MOVING TO OPPORTUNITY DATA
POD0000003264_S0000231 MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD SOMETHING LIKE A THIRTY PERCENT INCREASE IN EARNINGS
POD0000003264_S0000239 IF THERE IS ONE THEME THAT EMERGES FROM THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS
POD0000003264_S0000245 IN PARTICULAR BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE MEN GROWING UP IN A GIVEN NEIGHBORHOOD
POD0000003264_S0000250 CONTROL FOR ALL THE FAMILY-LEVEL FACTORS THAT YOU CAN SORT OF THINK OF
POD0000003264_S0000256 YOU TEND TO FALL BACK DOWN IN THE NEXT GENERATION AND THAT'S TRUE EVEN AMONG TWO KIDS WHO GROW UP IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD
POD0000003264_S0000265 YOU CAN GO AND ASK
POD0000003264_S0000272 THEY TEND TO HAVE PARTICULARLY GOOD OUTCOMES FOR BLACK BOYS RELATIVE TO WHITE BOYS NOW
POD0000003264_S0000280 THIS IS NPR
POD0000003264_S0000287 DON'T REALLY ACHIEVE THAT GOAL SO IN MOST PROFESSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
POD0000003264_S0000295 FOR KIDS' LONG-TERM OUTCOMES BROADLY
POD0000003264_S0000302 SO IF YOU USE TEST-SCORE-BASED MEASURES TO EVALUATE TEACHERS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU WILL GET A LOT OF TEACHING TO THE TEST NOW
POD0000003264_S0000309 THEN MAYBE YOU KNOW YOU ARE ACTUALLY TEACHING THEM SOMETHING THAT'S VALUABLE AND SO WE'RE GOING TO REWARD THE TEACHERS WHO HAVE THESE PERSISTENT IMPACTS RATHER THAN THE TEACHERS WHO ONLY HAVE SHORT-TERM IMPACTS ALL OF THAT SAID
POD0000003264_S0000316 WE ARE USING OUR DATA TO IDENTIFY NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WOULD BE AFFORDABLE TO LOW-INCOME FAMILIES BUT DELIVER MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES FOR THEIR KIDS SO THINK OF THESE AS PLACES THAT ARE BASICALLY OPPORTUNITY BARGAINS
POD0000003264_S0000325 YOU KNOW
POD0000003264_S0000337 AT THE POINT THAT THEY'RE MOVING FOR WHATEVER OTHER REASON
POD0000003264_S0000345 WE'RE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH GROUPS THAT PROVIDE MENTORING SERVICES SO THINK OF PROGRAMS LIKE BIG BROTHERS BIG SISTERS OR MY BROTHER'S KEEPER
POD0000003264_S0000356 THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT COMING BACK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT MOBILITY IS YOU CAN'T IN A MECHANICAL SENSE
POD0000003264_S0000365 HE GREW UP IN A FAMILY OF WRITERS AND HE ASSUMED WHEN HE WAS A KID THAT EVERYONE WROTE BOOKS AT ONE POINT RUSSELL MEETS SOMEONE AND IF I'M REMEMBERING THE STORY CORRECTLY I THINK IT'S A GARDENER
POD0000003264_S0000374 YOU KNOW TO THE IDEAL YOU KNOW ISAAC NEWTON'S IDEAL IF I'VE SEEN FURTHER IT'S BECAUSE I STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS
POD0000003264_S0000386 RAJ THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME TODAY ON HIDDEN BRAIN MY PLEASURE
POD0000003264_S0000397 WE LOOKED FOR A SCHOOL IN A PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT HAS ONE OF THE BEST RECORDS OF UPWARD MOBILITY
POD0000003264_S0000404 PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING A DONATION TO YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC RADIO STATION
POD0000003272_S0000017 THESE MEMORIES STAY WITH US AND SHAPE US
POD0000003272_S0000024 I FELT GUILTY FOR WANTING TO WASH OFF THAT SACRED MARK
POD0000003272_S0000032 IT WAS REALLY HARD WORK FOR HIM BECAUSE AS HE PUTS IT REMEMBER IN THOSE DAYS
POD0000003272_S0000040 I UNDERSTOOD THE PRAYERS
POD0000003272_S0000050 I WAS OUT RUNNING ERRANDS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD
POD0000003272_S0000055 THE NURSE STANDING OVER MY BED ASKED IF I COULD HEAR HER
POD0000003272_S0000062 EVENTUALLY THEY SAID I SHOULD GO HOME
POD0000003272_S0000067 BUT IT DEFINITELY WAS NOT
POD0000003272_S0000073 I HAD NEVER REALIZED HOW MUCH OF MYSELF ALL THAT MADE ME ME WAS DEFINED BY MY VOICE
POD0000003272_S0000079 IT WAS EXCRUCIATING TO STRUGGLE THAT WAY OVER SIMPLE ENGLISH WORDS
POD0000003272_S0000096 GETTING SICK IS TOUGH ON ANYONE BUT FOR A TWENTY SOMETHING IT CAN FEEL ESPECIALLY LONELY
POD0000003272_S0000102 THOUGH I'D LIKE TO THINK I WOULD HAVE TRIED
POD0000003272_S0000117 FOR YEARS I NEVER SHARED THESE RECORDINGS WITH ANYONE
POD0000003272_S0000125 THAT HONESTLY ENRAGED ME
POD0000003272_S0000131 I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE COULDN'T DROP EVERYTHING TO BE BY MY SIDE EVEN THOUGH HE VERY MUCH WANTED TO
POD0000003272_S0000141 I'M DOING IT
POD0000003280_S0000008 OF COURSE THIS KIND OF PANIC AND CONFUSION DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN WHEN FEMINISTS TRY AND TAKE OVER THE WORLD OF TANGO
POD0000003280_S0000017 THAT'S MY GRAMS
POD0000003280_S0000024 YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
POD0000003280_S0000033 SHE DIDN'T FIND IT ALL THAT COMFORTING
POD0000003280_S0000047 IT'S GIRLY IN A GENERIC LATE EIGHTY S KIND OF WAY
POD0000003280_S0000068 NOW MY DAD'S SEVENTY ONE
POD0000003280_S0000077 I MIGHT GET A GLIMPSE OF MY OLD DAD WHO KNEW ME YOU NEED ANYTHING
POD0000003280_S0000091 AFTER A WHILE
POD0000003280_S0000103 A FEW MONTHS AGO
POD0000003280_S0000108 WHEN I WENT TO SIGN OUT
POD0000003280_S0000132 HERE'S PARKER ON THE PHONE WITH GRAMS
POD0000003280_S0000139 SHE FORGETS WHAT DAY IT IS OR WHERE SHE IS OR IF SHE HAD DINNER
POD0000003280_S0000153 SHE SAID HER WRIST IS SORE
POD0000003280_S0000163 SHE HAS TO READ IT TOO
POD0000003280_S0000171 AND SOMETHING ABOUT THAT ALLOWED ME TO LET GO AND BECOME A NEW THING I HAD NEVER BEEN THE PERSON WHO TAKES CARE OF HER
POD0000003280_S0000177 SOMETIMES I DO
POD0000003280_S0000200 SHE SUMMONS UP A PIECE OF ME I NEVER EVEN KNEW ABOUT
POD0000003280_S0000218 THE CLOUDS BRIEFLY PARTED
POD0000003280_S0000225 HE TOOK MY HAND AND HE KISSED IT
POD0000003280_S0000235 SPECIAL THANKS TO MARK MEMMOTT MICHAEL RATNER RHONDA PARKER AND GENE PARKER
POD0000003288_S0000015 YEAH
POD0000003288_S0000028 IT WOULD GET REALLY UPSET WITH HER
POD0000003288_S0000040 BUT AS TIME WENT ON SHE SAW A DISTINCT PATTERN AND CAME UP WITH A THEORY OF WHAT THAT PART OF HER SELF WANTED
POD0000003288_S0000051 I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT ME TO QUIT
POD0000003288_S0000060 AND WHAT CAN YOU DO IF YOU DON'T WANT ONE PARTICULAR IDEA IN YOUR CULTURE TO AFFECT YOU
POD0000003288_S0000066 SO IT WAS NIGHT AROUND EIGHT P M I WALKED OUT OF THE GYM
POD0000003288_S0000071 MIDDLE-AGED WHITE WOMAN
POD0000003288_S0000081 OH MY GOD
POD0000003288_S0000091 LOVES MUSIC
POD0000003288_S0000101 CALLZIE
POD0000003288_S0000108 SOME CURLY FRIES AND COULD YOU BRING ME A MILKSHAKE
POD0000003288_S0000116 AND SO WE CALLED HER INTO OUR LIVING ROOM RIGHT WHERE WE'RE SITTING RIGHT NOW THEY TOLD HER THAT BECAUSE OF HER RACE KELLY FACED A DANGER THAT HER WHITE SISTER DIDN'T
POD0000003288_S0000124 MAKING HER OPTIONS SMALLER HER DAYS LESS FREE INSIDE HIM WAS A PART OF HIMSELF THAT HE HADN'T REALIZED WAS THERE AND THAT HE DEFINITELY DID NOT WANT
POD0000003288_S0000131 HE'D RIP THE BIAS FROM HIS BODY EVEN BEFORE HIS NEXT BREATH
POD0000003288_S0000150 SOMETIMES THE IDEAS WE'VE ABSORBED DON'T SIT SO EASY
POD0000003288_S0000158 TONY WAS USING QUESTIONS IN HIS WORK
POD0000003288_S0000165 A PSYCHOLOGIST AT YALE UNIVERSITY WHO DID THIS REALLY INTERESTING STUDY WHICH PROVED THAT QUESTIONS COULDN'T ACTUALLY CAPTURE HOW PEOPLE THOUGHT OR BEHAVED WHEN IT CAME TO RACE SEE WHAT DOVIDIO DID WAS HE FIRST ASKED PEOPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR RACIAL ATTITUDES
POD0000003288_S0000170 BUT PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY WERE NOT RACIST
POD0000003288_S0000176 HERE'S TONY GREENWALD AGAIN THE IDEA OF IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHEN YOU RESPOND TO THESE THINGS IS IMAGE MANAGEMENT YOU ARE PRESENTING YOURSELF IN A WAY THAT WILL LOOK ATTRACTIVE
POD0000003288_S0000184 IN SHORT
POD0000003288_S0000198 MOST PEOPLE
POD0000003288_S0000206 ROACH
POD0000003288_S0000214 SO HOW LONG IT TAKES YOU TO GROUP TWO THINGS TOGETHER CAN TELL YOU WHETHER YOU THINK OF THEM AS ALIKE OR NOT
POD0000003288_S0000220 AND WHAT IF YOU STRUGGLE TO LINK THOSE THINGS IN YOUR MIND
POD0000003288_S0000225 TONY SWAPPED THE CATEGORIES FLOWER AND INSECT FOR STEREOTYPICAL BLACK AND WHITE NAMES AND THEN TOOK THE TEST AGAIN TO FIND OUT HOW FAST HE COULD PARROT THOSE NAMES WITH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WORDS CHIP FREEDOM
POD0000003288_S0000230 HE IS A WHITE MAN WHO GREW UP THINKING OF HIMSELF AS A PRETTY PROGRESSIVE GUY
POD0000003288_S0000242 I WILL TRY TO BEHAVE IN A VERY DELIBERATIVE NON-PREJUDICED WAY
POD0000003288_S0000251 SOMEONE WAS VERBALLY FRIENDLY BUT HAD NEGATIVE BODY LANGUAGE BLACK PARTICIPANTS BASICALLY DISMISSED THE VERBAL ALTOGETHER
POD0000003288_S0000268 WHEN THEY TAKE THE SIGNS AWAY IT'S HARDER TO LOCATE IT
POD0000003288_S0000277 WHAT CAN YOU DO TO CHANGE THE CONCEPTS IN YOUR HEAD
POD0000003288_S0000285 I AM A RACIST THERE ARE MOSTLY WHITE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM
POD0000003288_S0000299 THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY FUNDAMENTAL THAT HE HADN'T UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE WORLD WHILE I WAS OVER THERE I KEPT THINKING
POD0000003288_S0000305 RON COULD SEE NO DIFFERENCE IN EYE CONTACT OR BODY LANGUAGE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WHITE FRIEND HE HAD NOT MADE A DECISION ABOUT WHO WAS IN CONTROL AND IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER TO HIM
POD0000003288_S0000312 HE FELT HE HAD TO IF I HAD TO SET UP A BUSINESS LUNCH
POD0000003288_S0000325 AND THEN ONE DAY
POD0000003288_S0000332 COULD BE THOUGHT OF AS A DISEASE BROUGHT ON BY HABITUAL BEHAVIOR
POD0000003288_S0000343 SOUNDS RIDICULOUS SUPER CALIFORNIA AND EYE-ROLLY
POD0000003288_S0000352 THE STRONGER THE CONNECTION GETS
POD0000003288_S0000361 AND SO THEY OFTEN ARE CONNECTED IN OUR MINDS I'M JUST GOING TO WATCH JUST IN CASE
POD0000003288_S0000371 SO GIVEN ALL OF THIS
POD0000003288_S0000377 ITS AIM IS TO TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO OVERRIDE THE BIASED CONCEPTS IN THEIR HEADS
POD0000003288_S0000383 REFLECT AND REJECT TO UNDERSTAND
POD0000003288_S0000393 AND THEN
POD0000003288_S0000398 BY REPLACING IT WITH AN ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE
POD0000003288_S0000404 WHETHER IT'S TRUE
POD0000003288_S0000411 AND THEIR INTERVENTION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO WORK
POD0000003288_S0000418 YOU JUST LEARN HOW NOT TO LET THE ASSOCIATIONS AFFECT YOU OR YOUR BEHAVIOR
POD0000003288_S0000424 WHEN WE COME BACK
POD0000003288_S0000437 AND SO THE EXPERIENCE WAS REALLY EMOTIONALLY COMPLICATED
POD0000003288_S0000445 WHICH FOUND THAT THOUGH THE FORCE DIDN'T HAVE THE PROBLEMS OF THE FERGUSON POLICE DEPARTMENT
POD0000003288_S0000454 SO RAY WENT
POD0000003288_S0000466 I WOULD GET PULLED OVER
POD0000003288_S0000471 THEY CONTACTED THE BUSINESS THAT WROTE THE CHECK
POD0000003288_S0000478 IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT IF I WAS DOING IT RIGHT
POD0000003288_S0000483 YOU KNOW
POD0000003288_S0000491 WHICH MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IF YOU ACCEPT THE WORK ON UNINTENTIONAL BIAS
POD0000003288_S0000496 WE DON'T FLOAT FREE
POD0000003288_S0000508 THE MAN YOU HEARD AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS STORY
POD0000003288_S0000513 HOPING THAT THIS MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR HOW PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT IMPLICIT BIAS
POD0000003288_S0000521 ALL OF THEM HOPEFUL THAT ONCE THEY GROW UP AND MOVE INTO THE REAL WORLD
POD0000003296_S0000008 SHE SITS IN A CHAIR AS HE FIDDLES WITH A HANDHELD COMPUTER
POD0000003296_S0000034 WE LOOK AT HER EXPERIENCE AND THE MAN SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH
POD0000003296_S0000040 AND THIS IS MEGAN'S STORY
POD0000003296_S0000057 BRIAN'S BIOLOGICAL FATHER HAD LEFT A MONTH AFTER HE WAS BORN AND HIS SINGLE MOTHER DID HER BEST
POD0000003296_S0000062 SHE HAD RECENTLY MOVED TO HIS HOMETOWN
POD0000003296_S0000070 IF SHE JUST WANTS TO BE FRIENDS THAT'S COOL SO ON THE NIGHT OF THE DATE HE PLAYED IT LOW-KEY
POD0000003296_S0000087 FOR EXAMPLE
POD0000003296_S0000098 WHAT SHE READ WASN'T RIGHT OR SHE MISSED SOMETHING
POD0000003296_S0000113 HE LOVED MEGAN LOVED HER JUST AS SHE WAS THE WHOLE OF HER
POD0000003296_S0000121 BEFORE BRIAN
POD0000003296_S0000129 BUT THEN DURING HER FRESHMAN YEAR
POD0000003296_S0000137 THEN LIED TO HER MOTHER ABOUT IT
POD0000003296_S0000145 STAYED UNTIL SHE WAS SO DEPRESSED THAT SHE HAD TO GO TO A PSYCHIATRIC WARD
POD0000003296_S0000158 MEGAN WOULD GET A HANDHELD DEVICE KIND OF LIKE A REMOTE CONTROL FOR HER BRAIN THAT THE DOCTORS WOULD PROGRAM WITH DIFFERENT ELECTRICAL SETTINGS I THINK THREE DIFFERENT ONES TO WORK FROM THERE'S A HIGHER LEVEL OF ELECTRICAL STIMULATION AND A LOWER LEVEL
POD0000003296_S0000169 AFTER HER HEAD WAS BALD AS AN EGG
POD0000003296_S0000184 BUT HE HAD TO ADMIT IT WAS AMAZING HOW THE PROCEDURE COULD CHANGE PEOPLE THE INSTANT WAY ELECTRICITY
POD0000003296_S0000197 HER DEPRESSION SCORE ON A SCALE CALLED THE MADRS WAS FORTY FOUR WHICH YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT IS VERY HIGH
POD0000003296_S0000209 THE IDEA WAS THRILLING BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT IS NEUROBIOLOGY THE BRAIN IS ALSO THE SEAT OF WHO WE ARE WHO WE ARE
POD0000003296_S0000219 WHAT ABOUT ENHANCEMENT
POD0000003296_S0000225 I THINK SO
POD0000003296_S0000237 AND THERE WASN'T MUCH HUBBUB DURING THE ACTUAL LEVEL SETTING
POD0000003296_S0000247 THREE OUT OF A POSSIBLE TEN POINT FIVE
POD0000003296_S0000265 AND THE FOLLOWING MORNING
POD0000003296_S0000281 AND WHEN THEY DID
POD0000003296_S0000286 SO IT WAS STILL TOO LOW TO MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
POD0000003296_S0000293 SILENCE SINCE BRIAN WAS INTIMATE WITH DEPRESSION HIMSELF HE KNEW HE SHOULDN'T TAKE IT TOO PERSONALLY
POD0000003296_S0000302 AND SO ABOUT HALF A YEAR AFTER HER ORIGINAL OPERATION WITH HER SETTINGS STILL AT THE LOW LEVEL OF ONE POINT FIVE
POD0000003296_S0000311 IT FELT FAMILIAR
POD0000003296_S0000320 BRIAN'S MOTHER DIED
POD0000003296_S0000325 MEGAN LET HERSELF INTO HIS APARTMENT AND LEFT HIM A PRESENT
POD0000003296_S0000335 I HAVE THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE I WISH I WAS DEAD THE PSYCHIATRIST NATURALLY SEEMED ALARMED AND TOLD MEGAN THAT IN LIGHT OF HER CONDITION
POD0000003296_S0000354 MEGAN WAS FINALLY ABLE TO READ AGAIN WITH EASE
POD0000003296_S0000361 SHE STILL SEEMED TO LOVE BRIAN
POD0000003296_S0000367 SAID YES
POD0000003296_S0000380 IT'S A VERY SWEET SCENE BUT IT TOOK THEM A LONG TIME TO GET HERE FIVE YEARS
POD0000003296_S0000386 SHE HAS A JOB
POD0000003296_S0000395 FEEL AN UNEASE ON SOME EXISTENTIAL LEVEL
POD0000003296_S0000405 I DON'T CARE WHAT'S DOING IT I DON'T CARE
POD0000003296_S0000412 WHEN MEGAN FIRST GOT HER IMPLANT
POD0000003296_S0000425 IF MEGAN RUNS OUT OF ELECTRICITY
POD0000003296_S0000433 NOW IT'S LIKE
POD0000003296_S0000439 IT COULD CHANGE A LOT OF THINGS
POD0000003296_S0000446 WHAT ISN'T CLEAR IS WHETHER THESE KINDS OF ENHANCEMENTS WILL ULTIMATELY CREATE INEQUITY BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD IMPLANTS AND PEOPLE WHO CAN'T
POD0000003296_S0000455 IT GOT TURNED OFF OH I'M OFF NOW AND I FEEL IT
POD0000003296_S0000465 SHE COULD FEEL THE MUSCLES IN HER NECK RELAX
POD0000003296_S0000474 I'M NOT RACIST
POD0000003296_S0000493 IF YOU OR ANYBODY YOU KNOW MIGHT NEED HELP

POD0000003400_S0000029 THERE IS CORRESPONDENCE BACK FROM USA GYMNASTICS SAYING SORRY UNLESS WE GET A COMPLAINT FROM A PARENT OR AN AFFECTED ATHLETE
POD0000003400_S0000036 AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT THOSE INSTITUTIONS PRIORITIZE THEIR REPUTATION OVER THE SAFETY OF YOUNG PEOPLE
POD0000003400_S0000043 I STARTED TO THINK A LOT ABOUT
POD0000003400_S0000048 AND I TRIED TO CONCEPTUALIZE MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THOSE BAND DIRECTORS IT WAS INHERENTLY DIFFERENT THAN A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A KID AND A COACH
POD0000003400_S0000057 AND I THINK PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE ALLURE OF THE OLYMPICS OH YEAH
POD0000003400_S0000067 IT REALLY IS A MINDSET SO THEN AS SOMEONE WHO HAS OBSERVED THESE PATTERNS I'M GUESSING THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME LISTENERS TO THIS EPISODE WHO HAVE KIDS THAT MIGHT BE WANTING TO BE ATHLETES MAYBE EVEN GYMNASTS OR SWIMMERS OR IN TAEKWONDO

POD0000003408_S0000073 AND ONE MORE THING FOLLOWING A DASH-TYPE DIET IS LINKED TO A DECREASED RISK OF HEART DISEASE AND STROKES
POD0000003408_S0000088 THE GOAL IS TO QUICKLY LOSE WEIGHT AND ULTIMATELY FEEL BETTER WITH FEWER CRAVINGS WHILE BOOSTING YOUR MOOD MENTAL FOCUS AND ENERGY
POD0000003408_S0000095 INSTEAD IT STARTS TO BURN FAT
POD0000003408_S0000109 WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW THAT THIS DIET IS COMPATIBLE WITH HUMAN HEALTH ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
POD0000003408_S0000119 SO THAT'S GOT TO FACTOR IN TO THE DIETARY DISCUSSION
POD0000003408_S0000126 THE IDEA IS THAT BY ELIMINATING MODERN-ERA FOODS LIKE HIGHLY PROCESSED CARBS AND DAIRY

POD0000003576_S0000031 EXPLAIN SO THIS WEEK THERE WERE TWO STORIES IN PARTICULAR THAT CAUGHT MY EYE AND MY INITIAL REACTION WAS JUST A BIT OF SIDE EYE AND LIKE
POD0000003576_S0000039 FROM VIRGINIA TO CALIFORNIA WE SEE STARK EXAMPLES OF HOW RADICALLY IN SOME WAYS THE COUNTRY HAS CHANGED
POD0000003576_S0000052 THIS IS A PROCESS THAT TRUMP HIMSELF HAS CRITICIZED AND SAID IS WRONG
POD0000003576_S0000059 AND SO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO KIND OF NARROW DOWN WHO WOULD BE ALLOWED
POD0000003576_S0000075 THERE WAS A TRAILER FOUND IN A WALMART PARKING LOT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
POD0000003576_S0000089 FACEBOOK USERS ARE FLAT IN THE U S ACTUALLY DOWN IN EUROPE
POD0000003576_S0000107 THE SEARCH HAS SEEMED TO BE VERY PUBLIC BUT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PARTS OF THE PROCESS THAT HAVE BEEN VERY VERY PRIVATE
POD0000003576_S0000121 HE'S CHALLENGING U S SENATOR TED CRUZ
POD0000003576_S0000128 THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CLASSIC KETCHUP IT'S A LITTLE BIT SWEETER THAN USUAL WHICH I LOVE
POD0000003576_S0000143 ASMA JOEY I HAVE A NUMBER FOR YOU ALL
POD0000003576_S0000151 AND SOME PARTS OF THE PROCESS SEEM VERY PUBLIC LIKE WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THIS NEWARK DEAL
POD0000003576_S0000162 VIRGINIA FOR EXAMPLE REFUSES TO SAY WHAT THEY'RE OFFERING
POD0000003576_S0000172 WHY IS THAT IT'S A REALLY FASCINATING AND COMPLICATED WEB OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES THAT NEGOTIATE THESE KINDS OF DEALS IT'S SO-CALLED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCILS VARIOUS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIPS IT ENTIRELY DEPENDS ON YOUR LOCATION
POD0000003576_S0000179 IS IT JUST A PUSH TO GET ALL OF THESE CITIES TO GO TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR AND OFFER THE MOST IN INCENTIVES TO GET AMAZON
POD0000003576_S0000195 YEAH
POD0000003576_S0000215 HEY THERE HEY YOU GUYS IT'S TIME FOR MY FAVORITE GAME
POD0000003576_S0000223 WE ARE COMMITTED TO PRODUCING AN ENTERTAINING SHOW IN THREE HOURS
POD0000003576_S0000231 THE FIRST THING THEY ANNOUNCED IS THE SHOW WILL BE SHORTER
POD0000003576_S0000241 JOEY CAME TO WIN
POD0000003576_S0000257 BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO MAKE A FINAL DECISION ON THE DESIGN WE WILL USE
POD0000003576_S0000267 THERE ARE SIX LOGOS TO CHOOSE FROM ONE OF WHICH SAYS MARS AWAITS
POD0000003576_S0000288 SHE'S BEEN FIGHTING DEPRESSION FOR THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS
POD0000003576_S0000305 I FOLLOWED THE EVENTS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE CLOSELY WE ACTUALLY TOOK AN ENTIRE EPISODE OF OUR SHOW LAST YEAR TO PROCESS IT ALL
POD0000003576_S0000310 AND THAT MADE ME THINK HOW ARE WE TALKING TO OUR KIDS
POD0000003576_S0000315 WE ASKED HER ON THE SHOW TO ANSWER SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT TALKING WITH YOUR KIDS ABOUT RACE
POD0000003576_S0000323 TALK ABOUT THAT APPROACH AND WHY YOU THINK IT'S FAILED
POD0000003576_S0000335 AND IT IS A VERY SIMPLE YET UBIQUITOUS QUESTION I LIVE IN A VERY WHITE COMMUNITY
POD0000003576_S0000360 LOOK ARE THERE SHORT WHITE PEOPLE AND TALL WHITE PEOPLE AND HEAVY WHITE PEOPLE AND THIN WHITE PEOPLE ALL OF THOSE THINGS OR DIFFERENT HAIR COLOR EYE COLOR
POD0000003576_S0000366 WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME
POD0000003576_S0000381 WHAT CAN WE POSSIBLY DO ABOUT IT RIGHT COULD WE WRITE A LETTER
POD0000003576_S0000405 WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU FROM A LISTENER GREAT THIS IS A NOTE THAT WE GOT FROM MEGAN IN CONNECTICUT
POD0000003576_S0000411 I TOLD HER SHE WAS LUCKY TO HAVE A NATURAL TAN
POD0000003576_S0000418 I SAID
POD0000003576_S0000423 I'M SORRY
POD0000003576_S0000442 AND BOTH OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE INTERACTIVE WEBINARS WHERE YOU CAN TALK TO OTHER PARENTS
POD0000003576_S0000458 I TALKED WITH TWO GUESTS ONSTAGE
POD0000003584_S0000016 THIS WEEK
POD0000003584_S0000029 I DON'T LIKE IT EITHER OK SO THEN Y'ALL WOULD NOT DO A FOX IF Y'ALL HAD TO PICK YOUR OWN QUARANTINE MASCOT WHAT ANIMAL WOULD IT BE
POD0000003584_S0000039 OK BECAUSE WHENEVER YOU HEAR THAT NAME WHENEVER YOU SEE IT IT MAKES YOU STOP AND GO WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THAT THING AND IF YOU'RE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRYING TO GET FOLKS' ATTENTION
POD0000003584_S0000048 THEY ARE HISPANIC

POD0000003584_S0000065 IT'S BEEN POSTPONED UNTIL MAY MAY SEVEN FOR COLLEGE TOWNS
POD0000003584_S0000073 WROTE THAT CONGRESS SHOULD CONSIDER DELAYING THE CENSUS AS LONG AS IT CAN YEAH BECAUSE IT IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE COUNT
POD0000003584_S0000079 ESPECIALLY ALREADY IT'S REALLY HARD TO COUNT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RECENT IMMIGRANTS
POD0000003584_S0000095 LIKE IT CHANGES THE WAY PEOPLE IDENTIFY SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT A CATEGORY LIKE BLACK
POD0000003584_S0000103 TO NOW IS WHITE
POD0000003584_S0000115 FROM FOLKS IN THE KNOW
POD0000003584_S0000132 IT'LL BE YEAH
POD0000003584_S0000162 SO RIGHT NOW A LOT OF PARENTS TO BE ARE WONDERING HOW THEY WILL DEAL WITH THE BIRTH OF A NEW CHILD IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS CORONAVIRUS CHAOS
POD0000003584_S0000170 SO THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
POD0000003584_S0000180 I HEARD THAT YOU ACTUALLY VENTED ABOUT YOUR MOM ON INSTAGRAM ONE DAY RECENTLY I DID AND I ABSOLUTELY ADORE MY MOM I LOVE HER VERY MUCH
POD0000003584_S0000187 HOW DIFFICULT HAS JUST THE LOGISTICS OF THIS SWITCH-UP BEEN FOR YOU
POD0000003584_S0000195 ESCORTED FROM THE ELEVATOR TO THE DESK
POD0000003584_S0000208 I THINK JUST HEARING THAT I LOVE YOU FIRST WOULD BE MOST IMPORTANT
POD0000003584_S0000225 THE SHOW ALL ABOUT RACE ETHNICITY AND CULTURE WITH THE TAGLINE
POD0000003584_S0000234 SO I SHARE THREE QUOTES FROM THE WEEK YOU HAVE TO GUESS WHO SAID THAT

POD0000003584_S0000266 AND HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT
POD0000003584_S0000273 HE SAID QUOTE WE HAVE MY SISTER-IN-LAW THAT LIVES WITH US OUR KIDS
POD0000003584_S0000281 WHAT IS THE FOOD ITEM THAT'S NOT SELLING WELL RIGHT NOW AS SPORTING EVENTS ARE CANCELED
POD0000003584_S0000295 WE ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO BRAG
POD0000003584_S0000306 I FINALLY DECIDED TO ADOPT A DOG FOR SOME COMPANY
POD0000003584_S0000321 THANKS SO MUCH TO THOSE LISTENERS ASHLEY KAREN
POD0000003584_S0000327 JUST GIVE US THOSE AUDIO TIME CAPSULES OF WHAT THIS MOMENT IS TO YOU RIGHT NOW
POD0000003592_S0000011 MANY THANKS TO IAN
POD0000003592_S0000027 I'M PLAYING RHIANNON BY FLEETWOOD MAC ONE OF MY FAVORITES APPARENTLY THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN SOME REPORTING THIS YEAR THAT THIS HAS BEEN THE YEAR OF FLEETWOOD MAC
POD0000003592_S0000046 AFTER THAT WE'LL PLAY A VERY SPECIAL GAME A YEAR-END GAME DELUXE EDITION OF WHO SAID THAT
POD0000003592_S0000059 THERE HAVE BEEN THESE LARGER BIGGER QUESTIONS ABOUT IN THIS MOMENT OF FLUX FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD LIKE
POD0000003592_S0000071 ITS PIVOT IN FORTY YEARS IS REMARKABLE THIS TREND OF GLOBALISM IN CRISIS OF CREEPING AUTHORITARIANISM
POD0000003592_S0000099 YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS LIVING IN ABROAD FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE EITHER TWELVE OR THIRTEEN HOURS AHEAD OF U S EAST COAST TIME
POD0000003592_S0000112 I WILL SAY THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW TIMES THIS YEAR WHERE I'VE JUST FORGOTTEN MY PHONE AT HOME
POD0000003592_S0000123 I HAVE ONE
POD0000003592_S0000138 HOW DID WE GET SO BAD HOW DO WE FIX IT
POD0000003592_S0000148 WHERE
POD0000003592_S0000161 SO ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS IS THAT WHEN A SOCIAL IDENTITY IS REALLY STRONG
POD0000003592_S0000170 YOU KNOW SCHOLARS OF AMERICAN POLITICS AND EVEN SOCIOLOGISTS AND GOING ALL THE WAY BACK ACTUALLY TO JAMES MADISON
POD0000003592_S0000187 WHO ARE OUR PARTISAN OPPONENTS BUT THEY'RE STILL OUR FELLOW AMERICANS AND TREATING THEM IN THIS DEROGATORY WAY
POD0000003592_S0000210 THANK YOU
POD0000003592_S0000223 ZARA DESIGNER IS CORRECT
POD0000003592_S0000238 BEYONCE
POD0000003592_S0000272 WE WENT BIG WE ASKED YOU TO TELL US THE BEST THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO YOU ALL YEAR
POD0000003592_S0000284 I NEVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM ALL THE TIME AND THEN EARLIER THIS YEAR OUT OF NOWHERE I GOT AN EMAIL FROM WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE HIS WIFE
POD0000003592_S0000295 ENJOY THAT AND HAPPY NEW YEAR
POD0000003600_S0000015 IS IT SAFE TO ASK YOUR CO-WORKER OUT
POD0000003600_S0000025 AND THAT'S HOW IT WENT DOWN FOR MITCH MITCHELL
POD0000003600_S0000032 EXACTLY
POD0000003600_S0000037 SO OUR FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE OR TAKEAWAY IS THIS DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE
POD0000003600_S0000042 YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS A POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR YOUR COMPANY
POD0000003600_S0000051 AND WE SHOULD NOTE OUR EXPERTS STRONGLY SUGGEST IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DATING SOMEONE YOU MANAGE OR YOU'RE THINKING OF DATING YOUR BOSS
POD0000003600_S0000060 AND KATIE HILL LEFT HER POSITION IN CONGRESS BECAUSE OF A CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP YOU MIGHT NOT THINK THAT'S FAIR BUT IT HAPPENS
POD0000003600_S0000069 GRYCH GOT A NEW JOB WHERE SHE ALSO FOUND HER NEW MAN
POD0000003600_S0000076 FORTUNATELY FOR GRYCH THAT NEVER CAME TO PASS
POD0000003600_S0000084 MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN TALK OVER WITH YOUR LOVE INTEREST
POD0000003600_S0000091 ARE YOU RISKING FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AS WELL AS YOUR JOB
POD0000003600_S0000098 THIS IS WHERE THINGS CAN GET VERY TRICKY
POD0000003600_S0000106 WHAT DO YOU SAY
POD0000003600_S0000111 AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE POTENTIALLY
POD0000003600_S0000118 OR EVEN IF YOU GET A I WOULD BUT THAT IS ALSO A SIGN THAT YOU HAVE TO BACK OFF BACKING OFF MEANS NOT ASKING A SECOND TIME
POD0000003600_S0000130 SHE WAS NOT HIS SUPERVISOR BUT SHE WORRIED THAT IT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR AN ABUSE OF POWER I HAD NO SAY ABOUT WHAT HIS PAY RATE WAS OR ANY KIND OF BONUSES THAT HE GOT AND VICE VERSA
POD0000003600_S0000138 BUT HIDING A RELATIONSHIP FOR TOO LONG CAN ALSO BACKFIRE JESS CARBINO PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY'VE HIDDEN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS ARE PROBABLY RELATIVELY NAIVE IN SHORT IT'S FAR BETTER TO BE UPFRONT THAN TO GET BUSTED
POD0000003600_S0000143 IF YOU BREAK UP THE CHANGE MIGHT BE LESS OBVIOUS TO THOSE AROUND YOU
POD0000003600_S0000149 SO POST-BREAKUP IS NO DIFFERENT
POD0000003600_S0000156 THEN PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO LEAVE SAYS HOFFMAN IF THE WORKPLACE IS NO LONGER SOMEWHERE THAT YOU WANT TO BE BECAUSE OF A BREAKUP THEN YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO MOVE ON AND TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
POD0000003600_S0000163 MAKE SURE YOU KNOW YOUR EMPLOYER'S RULES AND THEN ABIDE BY THEM THEN IT'S TIME TO THINK THROUGH YOUR WORST-CASE SCENARIO
POD0000003600_S0000184 OUR DIGITAL EDITOR IS BECK HARLAN AND OUR EDITORIAL ASSISTANT IS CLARE SCHNEIDER
POD0000003608_S0000008 IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS YOU KNOW IS GOING TO BE INTENSE AND YOU SHOULD BRACE YOURSELF EVEN BEFORE IT HAPPENS
POD0000003608_S0000016 AND ABOUT TO BE MY UNCLE
POD0000003608_S0000024 AND MILLIONS OF FAMILIES ARE TOUCHED BY ADDICTION
POD0000003608_S0000042 YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK CLINICALLY ABOUT A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER
POD0000003608_S0000049 AGAIN
POD0000003608_S0000058 HAVING SAID THAT A CHILD'S SAFETY OF COURSE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
POD0000003608_S0000064 MANY HAVE A PARENT INCARCERATED DEAD OR NOT IN THEIR LIVES ELUNA IS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT THAT RUNS THESE CAMPS IN THIRTEEN STATES
POD0000003608_S0000071 ONE ELEVEN YEAR OLD WHOSE MOTHER HAS BEEN IN REHAB SEVERAL TIMES SAYS THIS IS HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE A CUPCAKE EVERY SINGLE DAY AND CONSTANTLY AND IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT YOU'D FEEL REALLY SICK BLACK SAYS THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST ANALOGY BECAUSE WELL CHILDREN LOVE CUPCAKES
POD0000003608_S0000080 AND SO THE ROLE THAT SOMEBODY COULD PLAY IS HOW CAN I HELP DEVELOP THAT WITH A CHILD
POD0000003608_S0000087 IT'S ABOUT SHOWING YOU CARE CONSISTENTLY THOSE LOVING MOMENTS ARE WHAT WILL BUILD THAT TRUST IN THESE CHILDREN
POD0000003608_S0000098 MICHAEL STARTED GOING TO HER OFFICE TO CHAT EVERY DAY FOR TWO YEARS
POD0000003608_S0000108 I WAS TALKING TO ONE OF THE CAMP COUNSELORS DEREK FINK
POD0000003608_S0000116 EXPERTS STRESS WHEN TALKING TO CHILDREN
POD0000003608_S0000121 AND SHE LOVES WATCHING MOVIES AND SPENDING TIME WITH HER KIDS
POD0000003608_S0000132 TO TALK ABOUT HOW EMBARRASSING THIS IS
POD0000003608_S0000145 BUT IT'S FALSE GUILT ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY BLAME THEMSELVES
POD0000003608_S0000152 SO HOW DO YOU HELP A CHILD NOT FEEL THIS WAY
POD0000003608_S0000160 AND INSTEAD IT PUTS THE FOCUS BACK ON THEMSELVES BECAUSE WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IN THESE FAMILIES IS A LOT OF THE FOCUS AND ATTENTION IS PLACED UPON THE PERSON WITH ADDICTION
POD0000003608_S0000167 MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES AND CELEBRATE THEMSELVES YOU KNOW THE MOTHER YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES YOU KNOW
POD0000003608_S0000177 CRYING CLOSING DOWN GETTING DISTRACTED IT'S EASY TO INTERPRET THIS BEHAVIOR AS NOT CARING
POD0000003608_S0000185 HE MIGHT HAVE CONTINUED TO BELIEVE HE WAS A BAD KID AND NEVER TAKEN ADVANCED CLASSES OR GOT THROUGH SCHOOL
POD0000003608_S0000191 IT BECOMES A PART OF THE CYCLE OF ADDICTION I GET ON SNAPCHAT
POD0000003608_S0000202 IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THEY'RE ANY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CHILDREN
POD0000003608_S0000209 AND THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES END UP DOING SOME OF THE DAMAGE TO CHILDREN BECAUSE THOSE ARE ROLES THAT TYPICALLY ARE NOT HELD BY CHILDREN
POD0000003608_S0000222 THEIR EMOTIONS CAN MANIFEST IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS
POD0000003608_S0000235 OUR DIGITAL EDITOR IS BECK HARLAN AND OUR PROJECT COORDINATOR IS CLARE SCHNEIDER
POD0000003616_S0000012 NOW THE LAST PLACE MOST PEOPLE WANT TO BE EMOTIONAL IS AT WORK BUT IT HAPPENS RIGHT
POD0000003616_S0000018 BUT THESE DAYS THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN WORK AND HOME ARE BLURRY WE BRING MORE OF OUR PERSONAL SELVES INTO WORK AND WE BRING MORE OF WORK HOME
POD0000003616_S0000024 SO THEY BOTH THINK A LOT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE WORK TOGETHER AND HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE ANYONE WHO'S EVER WORKED WITH OTHER PEOPLE KNOWS IT CAN STIR UP A LOT OF FEELINGS AND THE MOMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH SOMEONE ELSE AND TALK TO THEM ALL THE TIME
POD0000003616_S0000040 WE HAD A GREAT KIND OF BROWN-BAG SESSION WHERE LIZ YOU CAME IN
POD0000003616_S0000056 EMOTIONS ARE GOING TO BE HELPING YOU MAKE A DECISION WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT LIKE THEY ARE JUST THERE
POD0000003616_S0000061 HE GETS OFFERED A PROMOTION
POD0000003616_S0000066 YEAH
POD0000003616_S0000074 SO WHERE A MAN MIGHT HEAR IN YOUR SLIDE SLIDE FOUR DIDN'T WORK AS WELL DELETE IT MAYBE IN SLIDE SEVEN MOVE THESE THINGS AROUND SOMEONE ELSE WOULD HEAR
POD0000003616_S0000084 LINE SEVENTY ONE I'M EMBARRASSED TO WORK WITH YOU HOW COULD YOU DO THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED THIS THIS AND THIS
POD0000003616_S0000096 YOU SOMETIMES JUST NEED TO CALM DOWN BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT IN A RATIONAL STATE OR YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN A STATE TO PROCESS THAT EMOTION AND SORT OF FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO NEXT WHEN IT BECOMES NEGATIVE AND ACTUALLY DETRIMENTAL TO YOUR OWN SUCCESS IS WHEN IT TURNS INTO RUMINATION WHICH IS WHEN YOU'RE JUST VENTING TO VENT AND YOU HAVE NOT SWITCHED YET TO A PROBLEM-SOLVING STATE
POD0000003616_S0000104 AND JUST TO SAY OK YOU KNOW LIKE
POD0000003616_S0000112 THE DANGER OF THAT IS THAT WORK-LIFE BALANCE DISAPPEARS AND WHEN YOU'RE SO INVESTED IN YOUR JOB
POD0000003624_S0000015 OR THEY'RE SMACK-TALKING RUNNERS WHO AREN'T WEARING MASKS AND GETTING TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT
POD0000003624_S0000025 I'M SO EXCITED TO MEET YOU LONGTIME LISTENER
POD0000003624_S0000036 MAYBE THEY'RE LIKE ME AND THEY'VE NOTICED THAT ALL YOU FANCY RUNNER TYPES ALSO HAVE FANCY BELTS THAT YOU CAN PUT BABY WATER BOTTLES IN AND YOU HAVE THIS REFLECTIVE GEAR AND YOU HAVE EXPENSIVE RUNNING SHOES
POD0000003624_S0000044 AND THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET YOU STARTED YES
POD0000003624_S0000064 I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WALK FOR LIKE THREE DAYS AFTER AND THEN I NEVER GO BACK OUT THERE AGAIN OR I GO BACK OUT THERE SIX MONTHS LATER AND I'M LIKE
POD0000003624_S0000074 RUN OUT HALF A MILE
POD0000003624_S0000081 IT COULD BE A LOT OF THINGS MY USUAL ADVICE IS THAT FIVE K
POD0000003624_S0000099 THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES
POD0000003624_S0000106 BUT BEYOND THE OBVIOUS
POD0000003624_S0000116 SURE DO IT OK GOOD ALL RIGHT HERE WE GO
POD0000003624_S0000123 I GIVE IT ALL OF MY EFFORT
POD0000003624_S0000130 WHICH ONE WAS HIS QUOTE
POD0000003624_S0000143 ALSO WE WANT TO HEAR YOUR TIPS WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO COPE RIGHT NOW
POD0000003632_S0000017 AND SHE'S OFFERING RESOURCES FOR FINDING A HEALTHIER BALANCE WITH SCREENS RIGHT NOW
POD0000003632_S0000026 SO I ALWAYS RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE THAT THEY TRY TO GENTLY GET INTO THE HABIT OF CULTIVATING MOMENT-TO-MOMENT AWARENESS OF HOW THEY FEEL WHILE THEY'RE ON THE SCREEN
POD0000003632_S0000036 AND SOME OF THOSE APPS ARE GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL AND SOME OF THEM ARE NOT
POD0000003632_S0000056 SO IT MAKES ME GRATEFUL FOR REAL-LIFE INTERACTION IN ADDITION TO BEING GRATEFUL FOR TECHNOLOGICAL CONNECTION WHEN TALKING ABOUT THIS IDEA OF ZOOM FATIGUE
POD0000003632_S0000063 WHERE WE TAKE AN EVENING A WEEK WHERE WE ACTUALLY DO NOT SCHEDULE ZOOM CALLS
POD0000003632_S0000069 FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY'RE JUST SURVIVING RIGHT NOW WHETHER IT'S EMOTIONALLY OR FINANCIALLY AND THE IDEA OF ADDING ANYTHING ELSE TO THEIR PLATE IS JUST OUT OF THE QUESTION
POD0000003632_S0000079 ZOOM FATIGUE IS A REAL THING SO GIVE YOURSELF BREAKS EVEN FROM VIRTUAL CONNECTION
POD0000003640_S0000009 BUT ALL THOSE PEOPLE AT THAT JOB THEY SAW YOU DO THAT AND BACK OF THEIR MIND NOW IS WELL IF YOU COULD DO IT ONCE YOU COULD DO IT AGAIN SO THIS CAREER COUNSELLOR SAYS THERE'S A LOT MORE TO LEAVING A JOB THAN YOU MIGHT THINK

POD0000003696_S0000023 ALLAH HAS PUT IT IN MY HEART TO ASK FOR A RANSOM
POD0000003696_S0000029 ESPECIALLY TO TERROR GROUPS WE DON'T NEGOTIATE
POD0000003696_S0000040 THE U S AND CANADA HAVE THIS NO CONCESSIONS POLICY WE DON'T PAY RANSOM
POD0000003696_S0000049 AND TO PAY A RANSOM AND EVEN TO FUNDRAISE FOR A RANSOM ACTUALLY
POD0000003696_S0000056 SHE SAYS THAT TREMOR HAS BEEN IN HER VOICE SINCE THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED
POD0000003696_S0000063 THEY TRAINED HER TO STAY CALM DON'T YELL
POD0000003696_S0000071 THEY MOVE AMANDA FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE

POD0000003696_S0000106 HE HANDS ME A CELLPHONE
POD0000003696_S0000116 I ACTUALLY THINK IT MAKES SENSE
POD0000003696_S0000122 BUT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN MANY DETAILED STUDIES OF WHETHER OR NOT IT ACTUALLY WORKS
POD0000003696_S0000135 OR IT COULD MEAN THAT EUROPEANS PAYING RANSOM GETS PEOPLE HOME
POD0000003696_S0000141 BUT IN THE REAL WORLD THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME POOR MOTHER WITH A BINDER FILLED WITH PICTURES OF HER KID
POD0000003696_S0000146 AFTER THAT SUMMER PRESIDENT OBAMA STARTS A REVIEW OF OUR POLICY
POD0000003696_S0000151 THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT GET IN THE WAY AND THIS MEANS THAT MONEY WILL GO TO TERROR GROUPS AND IT WILL GO TO CRIMINALS
POD0000003696_S0000160 AMANDA RAISED MORE MONEY TO SEND TO SOMALIA BUT THIS TIME SHE KNEW WHERE IT WAS GOING
POD0000003696_S0000170 WHICH IS THAT AN AGENT WANTS TO GIVE HIM A BOOK DEAL THAT AMANDA HAD FORGIVEN HIM WHICH IS TRUE
POD0000003704_S0000015 AND THEN ONE DAY SHE HAD THIS FLASH OF BRILLIANCE SHE NOTICED THAT THE MEN IN HER VILLAGE WOULD ALWAYS GATHER FOR A DRINK AT THE END OF THE DAY
POD0000003704_S0000024 GOOD OLD-FASHIONED CAPITALISM
POD0000003704_S0000031 THE IDEA OF MAKING A PROFIT OR GROWING A BUSINESS OR EVEN OWNING SOMETHING WAS BLASPHEMY
POD0000003704_S0000041 NORTH KOREA'S ECONOMY COLLAPSED AND AID FROM RUSSIA DRIED UP
POD0000003704_S0000052 SO KIM JONG UN DECIDED TO HELP OUT THE DONJU
POD0000003704_S0000059 NOTHING ABOUT THIS WAS NORMAL
POD0000003704_S0000072 ANOTHER PROBLEM THERE WAS JUST A LOT OF STUFF THEY COULD NOT TALK ABOUT SO IN ONE CASE WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE TRADE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA AND NORTH KOREA BUT THAT IS OBVIOUSLY VERY POLITICAL
POD0000003704_S0000084 THEY TOOK PHOTOS OF EVERYTHING THE DONJU WERE GETTING TRAINING AND SUPPORT THEIR BUSINESSES WERE GROWING

POD0000003704_S0000123 BUT THEY HAD HELPED NORTH KOREA BECOME A WEALTHIER COUNTRY A MORE WEAPONIZED COUNTRY DO YOU EVER FEEL AN ETHICAL CONFLICT WORKING WITH NORTH KOREA
POD0000003704_S0000129 IT IS ONLY BECAUSE OF AN UPCOMING MIDDLE CLASS THAT A COUNTRY CAN CHANGE BUT THAT UPCOMING MIDDLE CLASS IS IN A REALLY TOUGH POSITION BECAUSE IN NORTH KOREA THE STATE TECHNICALLY OWNS EVERYTHING THE DONJU ARE ALWAYS OPERATING IN A LEGAL GRAY AREA
POD0000003704_S0000137 SHE HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH BORDER GUARDS IN CHINA AND NORTH KOREA FROM WORKING AS A SMUGGLER FOR ALL THOSE YEARS
POD0000003704_S0000142 BUT IT CAME OF COURSE AT A HUGE PRICE FOR THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE YES THE NUCLEAR THREAT YES THE MISSILE THREAT THE VICIOUS THREATS AGAINST PEOPLE ABROAD BUT THAT'S JUST THE JANUS FACE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AT HOME ALL THE TIME TO MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A VOICE

POD0000003712_S0000138 BAYROCK SAID IT CAN'T COMMENT ON ONGOING LITIGATION
POD0000003712_S0000145 AND AT THE MOST
POD0000003712_S0000151 IT COULD BE CONSIDERED PART OF A CONSPIRACY
POD0000003712_S0000159 THAT PUMP-AND-DUMP SCHEME THAT HE PLED GUILTY TO
POD0000003712_S0000165 A LAWYER NAMED RICHARD LERNER PICKS UP THE STORY FROM THERE

POD0000003728_S0000130 YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING CRAZY BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHICH SWITCH CORRESPONDS TO WHAT LIGHT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET THE LIGHT ANYWHERE YOU WANT IT TO BE
POD0000003728_S0000147 IT COULD GO ON FOREVER IN THEORY
POD0000003728_S0000157 WE'RE ALSO ON TWITTER FACEBOOK AND MY FAVORITE INSTAGRAM TODAY'S SHOW WAS PRODUCED BY SALLY HELM AND NICK FOUNTAIN
POD0000003736_S0000013 WE DO THINGS

POD0000003736_S0000068 IN ONE OF THOSE EMAILS HO WRITES

POD0000003736_S0000093 THE CZECH PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY DID SO WHO IS YE JIANMING
POD0000003736_S0000103 AND THEN WHEN THEY ASKED THE COMPANY ABOUT THIS IT RESPONDED BY DELETING THAT INFORMATION FROM ITS WEBSITE
POD0000003736_S0000116 IT'S SO THEY CAN CALL EACH OTHER UP QUICK WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT BEING BUGGED
POD0000003736_S0000128 ROB WHAT IS THIS IT'S A PROPAGANDA VIDEO ON THE WEBSITE OF THE STATE NEWS OUTLET THE CHINA DAILY
POD0000003736_S0000137 SAME THING HAPPENED IN NEPAL WITH A CHINESE DAM LAST YEAR IN SRI LANKA
POD0000003736_S0000144 THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY PATRICK HO WHO WORKED FOR YE IN THE U S
POD0000003736_S0000149 AND THAT'S REALLY WEIRD
POD0000003736_S0000154 AND SEEING HOW THE SAUSAGE GETS MADE IT CAN UNDERMINE ALL YOUR GLOBAL AMBITIONS THIS RIGHT HERE IS A REAL LOOK INTO THE SAUSAGE MAKING
POD0000003736_S0000160 HO'S AGREED TO A TRIAL DATE IN NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR
POD0000003736_S0000170 I'M ROB SCHMITZ IN SHANGHAI AND I'M JULIA SIMON IN NEW YORK
POD0000003744_S0000021 AND BRIAN IS AFRAID THAT THESE ADS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO HURT HIM BECAUSE IN BLUE HILL THIS KIND OF NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING JUST DOESN'T FLY
POD0000003744_S0000035 AND IT WASN'T THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHO DID IT IT WASN'T CONGRESS IT WAS STATE POLITICIANS UNITING TOGETHER THAT WAS THE FIRST SORT OF COLLECTIVE EFFORT OF STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS TO MAKE A NATIONAL IMPACT THIS MOMENT WAS AN EPIPHANY FOR CHRIS
POD0000003744_S0000046 I HAVE TO ADMIT I READ THE NEW YORK TIMES BUT I DID AND READING THE NEW YORK TIMES SHAMEFULLY
POD0000003744_S0000053 THAT IS EQUAL REPRESENTATION AND SO EVERY TEN YEARS AFTER THE CENSUS STATES WILL OFTEN HAVE TO REDRAW THEIR MAPS TO ADJUST FOR POPULATION SHIFTS YEAH LIKE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE LEAVE KANSAS THEY MOVE TO MISSOURI THE MAP CHANGES RIGHT SO MAYBE MISSOURI GETS ANOTHER CONGRESSIONAL SEAT KANSAS LOSES ONE
POD0000003744_S0000058 I FOUND MY ISSUE
POD0000003744_S0000066 AND CHRIS JUST KNOWS THAT HIS PLAN WILL WORK
POD0000003744_S0000075 WHICH IS THERE ARE SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE LOCAL STATE LEGISLATIVE SEATS
POD0000003744_S0000080 IF THEY LOST OR GAINED A SEAT THEY WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE TO DRAW NEW MAPS SO WE PRIORITIZE THOSE STATES
POD0000003744_S0000088 CHRIS SPENT FOUR TIMES AS MUCH MONEY ON THAT RACE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THAN THE CANDIDATES HAD TWO YEARS BEFORE BUT NOW COMES THE REALLY HARD PART HOW TO WIN OVER TWO HUNDRED ELECTIONS THAT TURN ON HYPERLOCAL ISSUES THAT REALLY HAD NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE AT THAT LEVEL
POD0000003744_S0000095 AND THEN ALL CHRIS COULD DO WAS WAIT
POD0000003744_S0000107 WHICH MEANT THAT THEY WOULD ENTIRELY OWN THE REDISTRICTING PROCESS IN HALF THE COUNTRY
POD0000003744_S0000120 BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY IS COMFORTABLE WITH CAUSE THIS KIND OF LOCKS DOWN THE DEMOCRACY IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE DEMOCRACY
POD0000003744_S0000130 THE SUPREME COURT DID PICK UP TWO CASES THIS YEAR ABOUT PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING WHICH IS AN ISSUE THEY HAVE MOSTLY AVOIDED BEFORE THIS
POD0000003744_S0000137 IT COULD TURN THE COUNTRY'S MAPS AND THUS THE ELECTIONS UPSIDE DOWN
POD0000003752_S0000027 THEY THINK THE WHOLE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND JOE CERNELLI IS MORE TOWARDS THAT END
POD0000003752_S0000036 FUN FACT THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST HEADQUARTERS
POD0000003752_S0000044 AND THERE ARE ALL OF THESE LITTLE WAYS YOU CAN TELL THE DSA WAS NOT QUITE PREPARED FOR ALL OF THE ATTENTION FOR EXAMPLE
POD0000003752_S0000052 AND GIVE IT TO EVERYONE ELSE TOO SO TAXPAYER-FUNDED HEALTH INSURANCE FOR EVERYONE WE DON'T WANT SOMETHING THAT'S A HALF MEASURE
POD0000003752_S0000057 BUT IT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS SINCE A MEMBER OF THE DSA WAS IN A NATIONAL SEAT
POD0000003752_S0000063 AND THEN THERE'S SARA INNAMORATO IN PENNSYLVANIA
POD0000003752_S0000072 UNION NEGOTIATORS MIGHT GO TO THE BARGAINING TABLE FOR A CONTRACT AND SAY WE WANT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE BREAD
POD0000003764_S0000009 YEAH THANKS BYE THIS QUESTION IS BRILLIANT
POD0000003764_S0000027 YOU KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BE SO CLEAR-MINDED
POD0000003764_S0000038 IT'S WORTH A SECOND TO EXPLAIN THIS ONE IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY A LOT OF TEXTBOOKS TALK ABOUT IT HERE IS THE IDEA LET'S DO IT OK SO SAY ECONOMIST STEPHANIE KELTON NEEDS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO START A PANCAKE RESTAURANT YUMMY I DON'T KNOW
POD0000003764_S0000046 WELL IT GOT IT FROM THE KEYBOARD RIGHT IT WAS A ONE FOLLOWED BY A NUMBER OF ZEROS CALL IT THE POWER OF THE KEYBOARD
POD0000003764_S0000054 OF COURSE AND ALSO BUY A HUNDRED NEW AIRCRAFT CARRIERS FOR THE MILITARY

POD0000003764_S0000076 I WROTE IT ALL DOWN WITH ALL THE COMPLICATING DETAILS
POD0000003764_S0000087 AND THEN WILL YOU GET LIKE PEOPLE WITH WHEELBARROWS FULL OF CASH DUMPING PILES OF MONEY ON THE COUNTER WHEN THEY WANT TO BUY A CUP OF COFFEE
POD0000003764_S0000103 I DON'T SEE IT IN JAPAN
POD0000003764_S0000110 LET ALONE DOCTORS AND NURSES OF COURSE YOU NEED THEM STEPHANIE SAYS THOSE THINGS ARE WHAT CREATE THE SPEED LIMIT SO SAY THE FACTORY THAT MAKES THOSE WHEELING COAT-RACK THINGS IS RUNNING AT LIKE HALF THE CAPACITY THAT IT COULD
POD0000003764_S0000115 THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO SAY HEY SELL TO OUR NEW HOSPITAL INSTEAD OF TO YOUR OTHER CUSTOMERS
POD0000003764_S0000120 BUT WHETHER THERE ARE ENOUGH RESOURCES IN THE ECONOMY TO SOAK UP THAT MONEY THAT IS BASICALLY HER ANSWER TO AMY
POD0000003764_S0000131 DON'T THINK ABOUT THEM THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR MONEY IN YOUR PRIVATE LIFE LIKE DO I HAVE ENOUGH TO BUY THIS THING I WANT TO BUY THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT A HOUSEHOLD LOTS OF ECONOMISTS AGREE THERE BY THE WAY INSTEAD THE MODERN MONETARY THEORY FOLKS THEY SAY
POD0000003764_S0000143 WHAT DO YOU THINK

POD0000003780_S0000085 IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SIGNS THAT AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION HAD BEGUN BECAUSE THINK ABOUT HOW HARD IT USED TO BE TO GET PEOPLE HIGH BY MESSING WITH THE CANNABINOID RECEPTOR
POD0000003780_S0000092 CHEMISTS JUST TWEAKED THEIR FORMULAS AND STAYED ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE LAW WHICH BRINGS US TO CHAPTER TWO
POD0000003780_S0000097 BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT MARC DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SPICE OR K TWO BUT HE WAS BETTER-PREPARED THAN ALMOST ANYONE TO NAVIGATE THE LEGAL GRAY AREA AROUND RECREATIONAL DRUGS HE REPRESENTED THE OWNERS OF SO-CALLED HEAD SHOPS

POD0000003788_S0000085 YOU CAN USE A SIMILAR PROTOCOL
POD0000003788_S0000100 IN THE CASE OF THE PUBLIC HARBOR
POD0000003788_S0000107 BUT WITH BOATS THAT IS NOT SO PRACTICAL BECAUSE WHERE EXACTLY ARE BOATERS SUPPOSED TO PUT THEIR BOATS WHEN IT'S NOT THEIR TURN
POD0000003788_S0000117 MICK SAYS NOW YEARS LATER IF THE HARBOR CHANGED THAT SYSTEM THEY WOULD SUE AND IF THE HARBOR MADE SELLING SLIP PERMITS ILLEGAL
POD0000003788_S0000125 FOR SURE IT CREATES A SITUATION WHERE YOU NEED MONEY TO GET A BOAT SLIP
POD0000003788_S0000131 WE'RE WALKING ON A WOODEN DOCK

POD0000003796_S0000040 HE NEEDS TO FIX THE CULTURE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE OFFICERS JUST COULD NOT GET ALONG SO THERE WAS A LOT OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATIONS THERE WERE THIRTY EMPLOYEES AND FOURTEEN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATIONS
POD0000003796_S0000049 AND THIS MAY HAVE BEEN WHERE THE STORY ENDED BUT TONY HAD MORE THAN HIS WITS THIS TIME

POD0000003796_S0000125 AND TONY ADDED A FEW THINGS HIMSELF TO HELP FIX THE CULTURE HE CALLS ALL HIS PEOPLE TOGETHER

POD0000003836_S0000039 IN FACT WE HAVE NO OPERATING ACCOUNTS WITH DEUTSCHE BANK WE SENT QUESTIONS TO THE KUSHNER COMPANIES THE WHITE HOUSE TRUMP'S PRIVATE BANKER AND LAWYERS FOR THE TRUMPS AND JARED KUSHNER
POD0000003836_S0000050 I HAVE NOT FOUND ANY FIRE BUT UNFORTUNATELY I DO NOT POSSESS SUBPOENA POWER
POD0000003836_S0000067 HE WOULD FLY BANKERS TO ATLANTIC CITY FOR BOXING MATCHES TAKE THEM TO THE U S OPEN TENNIS TOURNAMENT IN QUEENS
POD0000003836_S0000077 THEY LENT SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A TRUMP TOWER CHICAGO
POD0000003836_S0000085 AFTER DEFAULTING ON THE LOAN TRUMP SUED HIS LENDER
POD0000003836_S0000092 DEUTSCHE BANK SUED HIM BACK
POD0000003836_S0000107 VRABLIC DID NOT RESPOND TO OUR QUESTIONS FOR THIS STORY
POD0000003836_S0000119 BUT POST-FINANCIAL CRISIS IT'S NOT IN GREAT SHAPE
POD0000003836_S0000132 WHAT WE DO KNOW WHAT'S IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE LOAN WAS UNUSUALLY HIGH FOR THE PROPERTY I THINK THAT THERE'S A LARGER CONTEXT HERE THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE OF DEUTSCHE BANK'S INVOLVEMENT
POD0000003836_S0000144 DONALD TRUMP'S FAMILY BUSINESS GETS A SIXTY YEAR LEASE TO RUN WHAT IS NOW THE TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL IN WASHINGTON
POD0000003836_S0000149 TOM BARRACK
POD0000003836_S0000159 TWO LOANS FOR DORAL AND ONE FOR THE OLD POST OFFICE
POD0000003836_S0000167 IVANKA TRUMP'S HUSBAND JARED KUSHNER'S COMPANY BUYS THE RETAIL FLOORS OF THE FORMER NEW YORK TIMES BUILDING FOR JUST UNDER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
POD0000003836_S0000179 AND THEN ROSEMARY VRABLIC'S TEAM APPEALED THAT DECISION WHICH IS QUITE UNUSUAL
POD0000003836_S0000197 OTHER GUESTS AT THE HOTEL INCLUDED JARED KUSHNER'S FAMILY AND KEY INAUGURAL PERSONNEL
POD0000003836_S0000206 THEY SAY THEY HAVE QUOTE
POD0000003836_S0000214 THIS PLANET MONEY VERSION WAS PRODUCED BY DARIAN WOODS AND LIZA YEAGER
POD0000003844_S0000015 AND I'M LIKE
POD0000003844_S0000022 NO
POD0000003844_S0000034 BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY S WHEN CREDIT CARDS WERE FIRST STARTING TO TAKE OFF
POD0000003844_S0000042 NOW YOU JUST GO TO YOUR BANK DISPUTE THE CHARGE AND IF YOU WERE WRONGLY BILLED THEY UNDO IT IT'S ON THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS
POD0000003844_S0000048 WE GO WILD
POD0000003844_S0000054 SO WHEN YOU SWIPE YOUR CARD OR STICK YOUR CHIP IN A MACHINE
POD0000003844_S0000067 THE BANK DECIDED IN HER FAVOR
POD0000003844_S0000072 EVERY BUSINESS PAYS FEES TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS
POD0000003844_S0000080 TO RECAP
POD0000003844_S0000087 THEY TELL ME THAT'S NOT HOW THIS WORKS NO CHARGEBACKS NO CHARGEBACKS VENMO TELLS ME THEY CAN'T CANCEL A PAYMENT WITHOUT STEPHEN'S PERMISSION SO THEY SAY THEY'LL EMAIL HIM
POD0000003844_S0000092 AND I START CRYING ON THE PHONE TO VENMO A LITTLE BIT
POD0000003844_S0000099 BY THE WAY VENMO IS OWNED BY PAYPAL
POD0000003844_S0000104 THE TWENTY DOLLARS IS GONE THAT WOULD SUCK UNDO BUTTONS ARE GREAT FOR THE PERSON HITTING UNDO
POD0000003844_S0000110 YOU KNOW I THINK PART OF THE REASON THEY DON'T HAVE AN UNDO BUTTON HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT VENMO'S CORE BUSINESS WORKS AND HOW IT'S ACTUALLY FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY THAT CREDIT CARDS DO BUSINESS EVERY TIME YOU BUY SOMETHING WITH A CREDIT CARD THE BUSINESS SELLING YOU THAT THING HAS TO PAY FEES
POD0000003844_S0000115 VENMO DOES CHARGE FEES FOR SOME PREMIUM FEATURES LIKE FASTER BANK TRANSFERS AND USING VENMO TO PAY SOME VENDORS DIRECTLY
POD0000003844_S0000123 STEPHEN THEY HAVE NOT
POD0000003844_S0000128 I HAVE NO PROBLEM SENDING IT BACK SO BASICALLY I AM FREAKING OUT I MEAN YOU CAN TELL FROM MY WRITING I'M LIKE
POD0000003844_S0000135 WHEN YOU VENMO MONEY TO A FRIEND OR WHOEVER
POD0000003844_S0000143 YEAH OK WE'LL DO THAT COSTS YOU THIRTY DOLLARS AND I'M LIKE GREAT DO THAT PLEASE THANK YOU
POD0000003844_S0000149 AND JUST LIKE THAT THREE DAYS AFTER IT STARTED IT WAS ALL OVER BUT I STILL DIDN'T TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED
POD0000003844_S0000155 HEY
POD0000003844_S0000167 I DON'T KNOW I THOUGHT I WAS BEING KIND OF POLITE ACTUALLY
POD0000003844_S0000178 AND IT COST ME THIRTY BUCKS TO USE IT THE UNDO BUTTON IS BASICALLY THIS TRADEOFF
POD0000003844_S0000184 IT'S THIS NEW IN-BETWEEN THING AND WE'RE USING IT ALL THE TIME AND KIND OF STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS
POD0000003852_S0000008 NO
POD0000003852_S0000013 AND IN OUR NINE YEAR OLD BRAINS WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT LIKE
POD0000003852_S0000019 HOW MUCH CONTROL DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE OVER OUR OWN LIVES DO WE HAVE LIKE FREE WILL
POD0000003852_S0000029 WE DECIDED TO DO THIS SHOW TODAY IN PART BECAUSE OF A VERY STRANGE COINCIDENCE BY THE WAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY RIGHT HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOUR BIRTHDAY IS THE SAME AS OURS YEAH
POD0000003852_S0000042 SHE IS HERSELF AN IDENTICAL TWIN WHO STUDIES RESEARCHERS WHO STUDIED TWINS
POD0000003852_S0000048 AND THE MOST SIMILAR-SEEMING RELATIVES THAT HE COULD FIND WERE TWINS SO GALTON FOUND A BUNCH OF TWINS HAD THEM ANSWER A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS THE TERMS IDENTICAL AND FRATERNAL HAD NOT YET BEEN COINED BUT HE KNEW THAT SOME TWINS WERE WHAT HE CALLED SIMILAR AND OTHERS WERE DISSIMILAR
POD0000003852_S0000054 LIKE FOR EXAMPLE SAY A RESEARCHER DISCOVERS THAT GENES PLAY A ROLE IN SOME PARTICULAR DISEASE
POD0000003852_S0000059 BUT ALSO A SOCIAL MOVEMENT ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT ONLY THE FITTEST ARE ABLE TO REPRODUCE THESE IDEAS LED TO FORCED STERILIZATIONS EVEN OUTRIGHT MURDER
POD0000003852_S0000070 IDENTICAL TWINS RAISED APART AND TO UNDERSTAND WHY HIS STUDY ENDED UP BECOMING SO IMPORTANT
POD0000003852_S0000076 THEN THAT SUGGESTS THAT GENES OR DNA PLAY A ROLE IN WHY SOME PEOPLE HAVE THAT TRAIT
POD0000003852_S0000082 I WOULD SAY THAT I'M THE SAME
POD0000003852_S0000088 SO IF THESE IDENTICAL TWINS RAISED SEPARATELY STILL END UP SIMILAR
POD0000003852_S0000098 AND EVEN IN THINGS THAT SEEM SORT OF INTANGIBLE LIKE SOCIAL VALUES
POD0000003852_S0000111 AND THAT'S WHY THEY ASKED ALL THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT LIKE THE BRICKS BROKEN BOTTLES BATS ABOUT PINCHING
POD0000003852_S0000125 AND ALSO
POD0000003852_S0000131 I AM RIGHT-HANDED SHE IS LEFT
POD0000003852_S0000138 IT'S THE ERROR TERM IT'S ANYTHING THAT'S NOT GENETIC IS THE ENVIRONMENT BUT LIKE
POD0000003861_S0000006 WE KNEW IT WOULD MAKE A FANTASTIC EPISODE OF PLANET MONEY
POD0000003861_S0000017 SOMETHING ABOUT ORDINARY PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES IN THEIR OWN WORDS STRUCK A CHORD
POD0000003861_S0000024 AND THERE THEY STAYED
POD0000003861_S0000030 AND AS YOU'LL HEAR WE TRACKED DOWN SOME OF THE PEOPLE STUDS INTERVIEWED IN THOSE TAPES MORE THAN FORTY YEARS AGO
POD0000003861_S0000038 MA BELL
POD0000003861_S0000049 YOUR ARMS GET TIRED
POD0000003861_S0000062 BUT FOR ME IT'S A GREAT TEMPTATION TO TALK
POD0000003861_S0000070 YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY OPERATOR I'M LONESOME WILL YOU TALK TO ME PEOPLE DO SAY THAT
POD0000003861_S0000079 YOU SEE YOURSELF AS A TELEPHONE OPERATOR FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE NO
POD0000003861_S0000088 I THINK I BECAME A REALLY GOOD LISTENER BUT LET'S GET REAL
POD0000003861_S0000093 BUT IT'S HARD TO AUTOMATE EVERYBODY'S WISHES AND WANTS
POD0000003861_S0000100 TELEPHONE SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR SHARON GRIGGINS
POD0000003861_S0000112 RIGHT IT'S THE FASTEST LINE SPEED IN THE WORLD
POD0000003861_S0000124 GM'S REASON FOR TRYING TO BE MORE EFFICIENT IS IF THEY COULD TAKE ONE SECOND AND SAVE A SECOND ON EACH GUY'S EFFORT
POD0000003861_S0000130 WE KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES
POD0000003861_S0000138 THIS IS WHAT I THINK IS FAIR
POD0000003861_S0000145 RETIRED HAVE BEEN FOR ELEVEN YEARS
POD0000003861_S0000152 AND LOOK THE UNION'S NOT PERFECT I'D BE THE FIRST TO SAY IT
POD0000003861_S0000162 AND I THINK THAT'S NECESSARY
POD0000003861_S0000167 YOU TALKED TO AN ACTUAL OPERATOR TO MAKE A LONG-DISTANCE PHONE CALL
POD0000003861_S0000183 SOMETIMES I WONDER IF THAT WAS THE BEST DECISION TO MAKE
POD0000003861_S0000198 AND WHEN I FIRST STARTED ON THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
POD0000003861_S0000209 CERTAIN UNITS HAVE REALLY DEVELOPED A SCIENCE AROUND STOPPING THE AUTOMOBILE
POD0000003861_S0000223 I WAS YOUNG
POD0000003861_S0000234 YOU KNOW HOW THEY FEEL
POD0000003861_S0000246 I GET A SMALL PENSION NOW
POD0000003861_S0000257 WE WENT BACK MORE THAN FOUR DECADES LATER AND FOUND THE FAMILY BUSINESS STILL INTACT

POD0000003861_S0000362 DUKE AND LEE'S AUTO REPAIR
POD0000003861_S0000368 AND YOU CAN ALSO HEAR IT IN THE TAPES
POD0000003861_S0000373 LOOKING FOR STRUCTURE
POD0000003861_S0000378 AND IF WE'RE LUCKY
POD0000003861_S0000383 FOR ASTONISHMENT RATHER THAN TORPOR IN SHORT FOR A SORT OF LIFE RATHER THAN A MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY SORT OF DYING
POD0000003861_S0000393 YOU CAN HEAR ALL OUR STORIES AT RADIODIARIES DOT ORG
POD0000003869_S0000020 THERE IS A VERY SMALL CHANCE OF MAKING HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY
POD0000003869_S0000030 HELP BASEBALL PLAYERS FINANCIALLY BY POOLING RISK AND INVESTING IN EACH OTHER
POD0000003869_S0000045 AND IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE LIKE
POD0000003869_S0000051 WHEN YOUR BEST FRIEND GETS CALLED UP
POD0000003869_S0000063 TOM WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING UNTIL HE HAS EARNED ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS PLAYING IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES AND ONCE I REACH THAT ONE POINT SIX MILLION LEVEL
POD0000003869_S0000072 THERE'S A PRACTICAL STRATEGY WHICH IS LIKE
POD0000003869_S0000078 GETS THE GUY ON THE LINE AND STARTS THIS HEARTFELT PITCH I'M TRYING TO BUILD A POOL OF A BUNCH OF DUDES SO LIKE
POD0000003869_S0000089 THERE NEED TO BE PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYERS WHO CAN LIVE WITH THIS COGNITIVE DISSONANCE TO BE ABLE TO BELIEVE IN THEIR HEARTS THAT THEY WILL MAKE IT BIG AND YET SOMEHOW ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY NOT AND ACTUALLY THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS AROUND INCOME POOLING
POD0000003869_S0000096 THERE IS POTENTIALLY
POD0000003869_S0000110 THREE OF THOSE PLAYERS HAVE MADE IT TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES PLAYED IN REAL MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL GAMES ONE EXAMPLE IS A GUY NAMED ROBERT DUGGER HE IS NOW A PITCHER FOR THE MIAMI MARLINS AND HE IS IN A POOL WITH EIGHT OTHER PLAYERS WHO ARE NOT GETTING PAID YET REMEMBER
POD0000003869_S0000117 STARTED OFF ROUGH I GUESS
POD0000003877_S0000011 THE FIGHT WAS OVER FOOTAGE RICK HAD SHOT OF A SUNKEN PIRATE SHIP RICK SAYS THE STATE USED HIS VIDEOS WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION
POD0000003877_S0000025 AND THEY'D BE LIKE OH HEY BLACKBEARD GO AHEAD TAKE ALL OUR STUFF TAKE THE SHIP TOO
POD0000003877_S0000033 AND THEN HE DITCHES THEM SAILS OFF A FEW MONTHS LATER BLACKBEARD GOT IN A FIGHT WITH A BRITISH NAVY LIEUTENANT
POD0000003877_S0000040 AND THERE'S A PLAN TO EXCAVATE THE SHIP
POD0000003877_S0000047 THE MONEY WILL COME SO THE DEAL'S DONE AND RICK STARTS DIVING ON THIS HISTORIC WRECK
POD0000003877_S0000054 THERE'S THIS ONE VIDEO RICK SHOT
POD0000003877_S0000070 BUT WHERE HIS ARM USED TO BE NOW HE HAS A PROSTHETIC I HAVE AN IRON HAND
POD0000003877_S0000075 REMEMBER HE OWNS THE COPYRIGHT SO RICK GOES TO A LAWYER AND THEY MAKE A DEAL WITH THE STATE
POD0000003877_S0000083 SO IN FIFTEEN DAYS IT WENT FROM COMMITTEE TO BEING A STATE LAW AROUND THE SAME TIME THE STATE ALSO POSTED SOME OF RICK'S VIDEOS FROM THE WRECK ON ITS YOUTUBE CHANNEL WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION
POD0000003877_S0000091 CONGRESS CAN MAKE STATES PAY FOR DOING SO SO THAT FIRST PHRASE
POD0000003877_S0000097 IN OTHER WORDS IF A STATE SAY POSTS YOUR MOVIES WITHOUT PERMISSION
POD0000003877_S0000102 NORTH CAROLINA'S COUNTERARGUMENT COMES DOWN TO THIS
POD0000003877_S0000111 SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY MEANS IN GENERAL
POD0000003877_S0000118 BUT OF COURSE
POD0000003877_S0000124 AND THE ANSWER KEPT COMING BACK TO THIS ONE WORD
POD0000003877_S0000129 SOMETIMES STATES DO SAY
POD0000003877_S0000134 AND THAT LAW THAT CONGRESS PASSED THAT SAYS OTHERWISE IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT'S THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEPPING ON STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY
POD0000003877_S0000139 NOBODY CAN SUE A STATE FOR DAMAGES FOR INFRINGING COPYRIGHTS
POD0000003877_S0000150 OK
POD0000003877_S0000160 AND THERE HAS BEEN THIS SERIES OF SUPREME COURT CASES LIKE RICK ALLEN'S OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES
POD0000003877_S0000169 ALSO THANKS TO ALL THE LAWYERS WHO HELPED US GET A HANDLE ON THE LEGAL DETAILS
POD0000003885_S0000012 IT'S AT A CONFERENCE LIKE THIS THAT YOU REALIZE THAT ECONOMISTS ARE NOT NORMAL PEOPLE THEY THINK IN THIS VERY PARTICULAR WAY NOT JUST ABOUT
POD0000003885_S0000017 WHAT IS THE MOST USEFUL IDEA IN ECONOMICS
POD0000003885_S0000035 AND LITERALLY AT THIS MOMENT LISA COOK IS GIVING UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO MANY THINGS CAN YOU JUST LIKE RATTLE OFF A FEW OF THEM
POD0000003885_S0000057 HOW MANY BOOKS SHOULD YOU READ
POD0000003885_S0000067 THE CALORIES I'M CONSUMING
POD0000003885_S0000085 BUT WHEN WE FIRST MOVED IN TOGETHER THERE WAS THE INEVITABLE QUESTION OF SORT OF WHO SHOULD DO WHAT
POD0000003885_S0000103 EIGHT
POD0000003885_S0000121 REALLY FUNNY TO AN ECONOMIST WHAT'S THE MOST USEFUL IDEA IN ECONOMICS
POD0000003885_S0000131 IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS NATURALLY IN THE WORLD THAT ALLOWS YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER ONE THING CAUSES ANOTHER
POD0000003885_S0000139 THEY INFERRED THAT IN THIS INSTANCE
POD0000003885_S0000144 YOU KNOW
POD0000003885_S0000153 EASIER IN SAN DIEGO THAN THE COLDER CITIES YEAH CHICAGO'S NEXT YEAR THERE MIGHT BE
POD0000003885_S0000172 TAKE THAT THIRTY PERCENT RIGHT AND THEN WE USE IT TO WHATEVER TO EAT OUT MORE TO TAKE YOGA CLASSES TO FLY ON AIRPLANES TO DO ALL THIS SPENDING THAT CREATES NEW JOBS
POD0000003885_S0000183 ECONOMICALLY INSECURE PERSONAL SERVICES LIKE FOOD SERVICE CLEANING WELL THERE'S SORT OF THE POLICY QUESTION RIGHT LIKE YUP
POD0000003885_S0000205 DID IT
POD0000003893_S0000025 NOT EVEN BY A PORT
POD0000003893_S0000035 I NEED A BILLIONAIRE'S BREAKFAST I NEED TO GO TO BLUESTONE LANE ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST PRESTIGIOUS COFFEE SHOPS IN NEW YORK
POD0000003893_S0000050 IS THIS THING RIGHT HERE IT IS CALLED A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS VALENTINE TO A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS
POD0000003893_S0000056 TO COME UP WITH A NUMBER TO ANSWER THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION HOW MUCH IS THIS THING THIS BUILDING THIS COMPANY HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
POD0000003893_S0000064 BUT LIKE THE HARD QUESTION IS
POD0000003893_S0000071 AND IT WAS LIKE WHOA
POD0000003893_S0000077 THAT IS EXACTLY IT
POD0000003893_S0000090 WE CAN EXPENSE IT
POD0000003893_S0000099 AND THAT TOOK A WHILE TO SELL OK SO YOU HAVE YOU HAVE BOXES OF PLASTIC BANANAS LIKE HOLDERS IN YOUR HOME
POD0000003893_S0000110 THEY'RE JUST SITTING IN THE WATER WITH IT IN THEIR HAND
POD0000003893_S0000120 BUT THEY'RE STILL YOUNG ENOUGH THAT THEY PROBABLY HAVEN'T STARTED RETIRING IN BIG NUMBERS OH SO PRIME AGE MEANS PRIME WORKING AGE EXACTLY THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELIEST TO BE WORKING SO THAT'S PRIME WORKING AGE CORRECT AND THEN EMPLOYMENT-TO-POPULATION RATIO FOR THOSE PEOPLE MEANS IT MEANS HOW MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE A JOB
POD0000003893_S0000133 MORE THAN A MILLION AND A HALF MORE PEOPLE IN AMERICA WOULD BE EMPLOYED
POD0000003893_S0000147 TWO TO THREE HOURS
POD0000003901_S0000006 A HUGE WEEK AND THOSE ARE HUGE PROPOSALS
POD0000003901_S0000019 YES
POD0000003901_S0000033 IF YOU CUT INTEREST RATES IT DOESN'T FIX THOSE THINGS SO THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE THE KINDS OF SPENDING THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO TAXES IT CAN CUT
POD0000003901_S0000040 LIKE WE SAW DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS
POD0000003901_S0000057 YOU CAN GIVE PEOPLE A LOT OF CHECKS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FLY ON INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS SO I WORRY ABOUT THE DURABILITY OF THAT SOLUTION
POD0000003901_S0000067 THESE ARE JOBS YOU CANNOT DO FROM HOME AND THEY ALSO TEND TO BE LOWER-WAGE JOBS THEY TEND TO HAVE FEWER BENEFITS
POD0000003901_S0000078 THINK OF THESE AS LIKE THE AIR BAGS FOR THE ECONOMY AS IT STARTS TO CRASH
POD0000003901_S0000091 IT TO MY MIND IT ONLY UNDERSCORED IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN
POD0000003901_S0000106 DO YOU THINK THIS CURRENT MOMENT ECONOMIC MOMENT COMPARES TO THE PREVIOUS ONE AT ALL
POD0000003901_S0000115 AS SOON AS THE RAINSTORM IS OVER
POD0000003901_S0000122 FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS' WORTH OF HELP
POD0000003901_S0000129 ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THOSE CATEGORIES WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK ECONOMICALLY AND HEALTH-WISE FROM THIS VIRUS
POD0000003901_S0000136 PERSONALLY MY VIEW IS THAT
POD0000003909_S0000012 HEY TODD
POD0000003909_S0000027 THE STORY OF HOW TODD OLSON'S COMPANY GOT DRAFTED INTO THIS WORLDWIDE MISSION TO DO THEIR LITTLE PART TO MAKE THOSE LITTLE PISTONS BEGINS IN SEATTLE
POD0000003909_S0000035 BUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO THERE REALLY ISN'T AN ALTERNATIVE
POD0000003909_S0000040 IT'S THE COMPANY THAT CONTRACTED TODD TO MAKE THOSE LITTLE PISTONS
POD0000003909_S0000046 THEY CALLED HIS CELLPHONE HIS OFFICE THEY EMAILED ALL WITHIN TWO MINUTES
POD0000003909_S0000053 LITTLE METAL PISTONS IT'S EASY TO CREATE A PUMP
POD0000003909_S0000059 WE SOURCE FROM ABOUT EIGHTY DIFFERENT SUPPLIERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD THAT SOUNDS REALLY COMPLICATED AND IT IS
POD0000003909_S0000069 AND WHAT THIS DOES IS ALLOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BECOME ESSENTIALLY A PANDEMIC PROJECT MANAGER
POD0000003909_S0000074 SO THIS OTHER DIFFERENT WAY STARTED TO HAPPEN ORGANICALLY IT WAS UNLIKELY MATCHMAKING BETWEEN
POD0000003909_S0000084 HEARS THE CALL GM PUT OUT A MASS EMAIL TO ANYBODY IN OUR INDUSTRY THAT THEY'VE WORKED WITH THAT PROJECT V NEEDS DIE CASTINGS
POD0000003909_S0000096 IT WILL HOLD UP THE ENTIRE EFFORT TO BUILD MORE VENTILATORS TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES HERE'S WHAT IT TOOK FOR TODD'S COMPANY TO SCALE UP JUST ONE OF THE HUNDREDS OF PARTS THE TEENY PISTONS
POD0000003909_S0000101 IT'S GOT TO BE MADE OF STEEL WEIGHING ALMOST TWO TONS
POD0000003909_S0000109 THIS WAS CONDUCTED JUST THREE DAYS AFTER HE MADE THAT CALL TO MICHIGAN
POD0000003909_S0000131 I'M FEELING AWESOME
POD0000003909_S0000140 IT'S NOT JUST VENTEC IT'S NOT JUST GM
POD0000003909_S0000145 CHRIS KIPLE SAYS THAT VENTEC
POD0000003909_S0000151 AND IF WE DID
POD0000003909_S0000156 IF TOO MANY PEOPLE NEED VENTILATORS AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000003909_S0000162 WE ARE COLLECTIVELY REDUCING DEMAND FOR VENTILATORS
POD0000003917_S0000015 WINDEX
POD0000003917_S0000031 SOME PEOPLE GET TO STAY HOME
POD0000003917_S0000042 MANY OF THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS RIGHT NOW ARE LOW-PAID THEY ARE WAREHOUSE AND DELIVERY PEOPLE TRUCK DRIVERS BUS DRIVERS JANITORS
POD0000003917_S0000067 PEOPLE OF COLOR AND MORE LIKELY TO BE IMMIGRANTS
POD0000003917_S0000073 SO AT FATIMA'S STORE THERE ARE ALL THESE SIGNS HANGING UP SAYING
POD0000003917_S0000083 SHE NEEDED THE JOB
POD0000003917_S0000107 BUT THIS ONLY REALLY HAPPENS ON ITS OWN IN A COMPETITIVE LABOR MARKET WHEN WORKERS HAVE OPTIONS AND EMPLOYERS HAVE TO COMPETE FOR WORKERS
POD0000003917_S0000113 HER BOSS NEEDS TO BE WORRIED THAT SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO OFFER HER A BETTER JOB A BETTER-PAYING JOB OR A SAFER JOB CAUSE FATIMA'S BOSS IS LIKE WELL WHAT ARE YOU WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO DO
POD0000003917_S0000119 I THINK THERE'S SERIOUS QUESTIONS WHETHER THAT'S ENOUGH AND HERE'S WHAT REALLY STINGS FATIMA AND A BUNCH OF OTHER LOW-WAGE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO ARE GOING INTO WORK THEY COULD ACTUALLY MAKE MORE MONEY IF THEY GOT LAID OFF HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED BEFORE THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
POD0000003917_S0000124 IN SOME STATES YOU GET LIKE THIRTY PERCENT OF WHAT YOUR REGULAR PAY WAS IN OTHER STATES IT'S FIFTY PERCENT OR SIXTY PERCENT
POD0000003917_S0000132 OF COURSE
POD0000003917_S0000141 BUT SO FAR
POD0000003917_S0000147 INCLUDING OUR JUST REASSESSING OF WHAT TYPE OF WORK IS IMPORTANT
POD0000003917_S0000166 SO WHEN I CALLED TO CHECK IN WITH FATIMA WHO BY THE WAY SAYS SHE'S FEELING FINE
POD0000004039_S0000009 SO WE PICKED UP THE PHONE AND CHECKED IN

POD0000004039_S0000048 JACQUIE'S THE KIND OF PERSON WHO AVOIDS CONFRONTATION
POD0000004039_S0000055 THE CULTURE IS REALLY REALLY DIFFERENT
POD0000004039_S0000066 BUT THE WEEKEND WOULD NOT GO AS SHE EXPECTED MAYBE NO BETTER WAY TO LEARN ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE'S CULTURE THAN BY HAVING THEIR BABY
POD0000004039_S0000092 PEOPLE GET LESSONS ON HOW TO DO IT JESSIE PICKS UP THE PACKAGE LOOKS CURIOUSLY AND
POD0000004039_S0000106 SHE COULDN'T EVEN GET A VISA HER FIRST TIME AROUND
POD0000004039_S0000122 BUT THE TOP-TIER UNIVERSITIES IN CHINA THEY WANT MORE FOREIGN STUDENTS WHO COULD RAISE THE PROFILE OF THE SCHOOL
POD0000004039_S0000132 IT SAYS IF THE PARENTS WANT HER TO ABORT BECAUSE OF GENETIC DISEASE SHE WILL
POD0000004039_S0000137 IT'S THAT FRIENDSHIP THAT CONNECTION SHE'S HOPING FOR
POD0000004039_S0000153 SHE IS FEELING SO STRANGE
POD0000004039_S0000179 THESE PEOPLE ARE TRUSTING ME
POD0000004039_S0000184 SHE TAKES A DEEP BREATH AND BEGINS AGAIN
POD0000004039_S0000196 IT'S OK
POD0000004039_S0000215 AND THEN BEING TOLD I ONLY
POD0000004039_S0000226 HOW GENEROUS
POD0000004039_S0000240 BUT IT'S BEEN AWESOME
POD0000004039_S0000257 WE'RE BACK WITH ROUGH TRANSLATION
POD0000004039_S0000262 IF SHE HAD BEEN AT HIGH RISK SHE PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE PASSED THE SCREENING TO BECOME A SURROGATE
POD0000004039_S0000275 IT'S FOUR WEEKS BEFORE THE DUE DATE BUT THE DOCTORS TELL HER THEY HAVE TO GET THE BABY OUT NOW
POD0000004039_S0000305 AND WHEN THEY PARK THE CAR AT THE HOSPITAL SHE RUNS THROUGH THE PARKING LOT HER MOM AND JESS HURRYING TO KEEP UP
POD0000004039_S0000313 BEHIND THE DOOR ON THE RIGHT
POD0000004039_S0000333 THEY LOOKED GOOD ON X-RAY AFTER JESSIE GETS THROUGH HER QUESTIONS
POD0000004039_S0000347 IT WILL LOOK GOOD AND THEN SHOOT BACK UP AGAIN WHEN SHE DOES ANYTHING STRESSFUL
POD0000004039_S0000359 AND NOW SHE'S READ A PILE OF STUDIES ABOUT HOW THE FATHER'S GENES MAY BE A FACTOR IN PRE-ECLAMPSIA AND THEY USED A TERM THAT I DON'T LIKE AT ALL CALLED THE DANGEROUS FATHER EFFECT
POD0000004039_S0000366 SOMETHING HAS CHANGED BETWEEN THEM
POD0000004039_S0000377 SHE WANTS ME TO COME TO CHINA AND VISIT HER FAMILY SHE DOES
POD0000004039_S0000385 SHE JUST WANTED TO GO BACK HOME GET HER LIFE BACK
POD0000004039_S0000394 SO THAT WAS KIND OF SAD I MISSED OUT ON SOME TIME PLAYING WITH HIM TOO EVEN IN THESE TIMES WHEN SHE HAD TO KIND OF ISOLATE HERSELF FROM HER OWN FAMILY
POD0000004039_S0000402 JACQUIE SIGNED UP FOR MARTIAL ARTS CLASSES
POD0000004039_S0000407 MEANWHILE IN CHINA
POD0000004039_S0000420 IT WAS HER TODDLER OFTEN COMFORTING HER
POD0000004039_S0000431 SHE LOVED HER NEW NURSING JOB
POD0000004039_S0000441 SHE SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S EXACTLY WHERE SHE FEELS LIKE SHE SHOULD BE
POD0000004047_S0000011 AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WE DID A FEW YEARS
POD0000004047_S0000023 HER DAD BROUGHT HER IN AFTER SHE WAS THRASHING AROUND IN HER SLEEP
POD0000004047_S0000032 SHE SAID OK
POD0000004047_S0000039 HAND MOVEMENTS AND LIKE
POD0000004047_S0000051 BECAUSE IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME TO KEEP UP THE ILLUSION THAT I WAS SOBER
POD0000004047_S0000065 SHE WONDERED IF THOSE BIRTHDAY CAKES THOSE PUBLIC CELEBRATIONS OF SUCCESS
POD0000004047_S0000074 YOU KNOW HOW INDONESIANS SMILE AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY SMILING
POD0000004047_S0000081 THE SHOW WHERE WE GO TO FAR-OFF PLACES WITH STORIES THAT HIT CLOSE TO HOME
POD0000004047_S0000089 THE FIRST PERSON JULIA'S GOING TO INTRODUCE US TO IN INDONESIA IS SOMEONE WHOSE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD IS CONSPIRING TO LIE FOR HIM
POD0000004047_S0000108 MY NEIGHBORS
POD0000004047_S0000119 RIDWAN'S GRANDFATHER WAS AN ISLAMIC SCHOLAR
POD0000004047_S0000130 WHY DON'T HE JUST WORK WITH ME
POD0000004047_S0000139 WAIT MALU MALU AND MALU ARE DIFFERENT WORDS THERE ARE EVEN INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS AIMED AT WESTERN BUSINESSPEOPLE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH MALU CULTURE
POD0000004047_S0000158 WAS THIS JUST LIKE KIND OF MIND-BOGGLING TO JUST
POD0000004047_S0000173 HONESTY OPEN MIND AND WILLINGNESS YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS
POD0000004047_S0000184 GET ME THINKING
POD0000004047_S0000198 THERE'S JOB TRAINING WE DO NOT DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR CLIENTS
POD0000004047_S0000206 WHEN SAM'S CLINIC OPENED UP HIS NEIGHBORS ATTACKED HIM FOR HIS APPROACH YOU JUST KEEP PEOPLE USING DRUGS
POD0000004047_S0000216 THE PEOPLE IT'S DEPEND DEPEND ON THE GROUP OF THAT PEOPLE
POD0000004047_S0000235 BUT WHEN SAM SAYS THIS STUFF HE'S GENTLE ABOUT IT
POD0000004047_S0000241 OK
POD0000004047_S0000251 DO YOU DO WHO WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT FROM
POD0000004047_S0000260 I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT WHAT I LEARNED FROM SAM
POD0000004047_S0000265 BUT I REALIZED THERE WAS SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM SAM THAT WASN'T EVEN ABOUT MY MOM
POD0000004047_S0000275 AND THEN I TOLD HER WHAT SAM'S DOING WITH MALU THIS WAY OF TALKING TO PEOPLE NOT BE LIKE YOU'RE LYING TO ME LIKE I KNOW THAT YOU REPEATED A LIE
POD0000004047_S0000289 LIKE THERE'S A CHARACTER IN PEANUTS PIGPEN AND YOU NEVER REALLY SAW HIM
POD0000004047_S0000295 A FRIEND OF MINE FROM INDONESIA TOLD ME THAT MALU IS BEING AFRAID TO TAKE OFF YOUR MASK
POD0000004047_S0000303 I STILL DO HAVE ANGER
POD0000004047_S0000312 ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I WAS LYING TO MYSELF VERY DEEPLY
POD0000004047_S0000330 JANE GILVIN FACT-CHECKED THIS EPISODE GRETA PITTENGER AND KATIE DAUGERT HELPED WITH RESEARCH MASTERING BY ISAAC RODRIGUEZ
POD0000004055_S0000014 BUT CAT FOOD WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AMERICANS WERE HOARDING
POD0000004055_S0000030 AND WAIT SO THIS IS LIKE YOUR FIRST FORAY OUT INTO THE WORLD
POD0000004055_S0000042 EVEN AS SHE'S TRYING TO GET THE WOMAN'S ATTENTION AND SHE IS PAYING NO ATTENTION TO HER DOG BECAUSE SHE'S CHATTING WITH THE GUYS BEHIND HER WHO ARE BOTH THEY REALLY SEEM KIND OF LIKE BROS ALSO IN THEIR TWENTY S
POD0000004055_S0000053 ELIZABETH GOES FROM FEELING SHAME TO TRYING TO CONVEY SHAME
POD0000004055_S0000061 I MEAN MAYBE PARTLY IT'S JUST THAT I'M ORIGINALLY FROM MINNESOTA AND WE ARE SO COMPULSIVELY POLITE
POD0000004055_S0000070 SHOULD I SAY SOMETHING AND WHAT WOULD I SAY
POD0000004055_S0000078 IS IT WORKING
POD0000004055_S0000089 THIS PART OF THE STRATEGY HAS A PARTICULAR SOUND
POD0000004055_S0000097 IT'S MORE LIKE HURRICANE WARNINGS OR AN AMBER ALERT THAT COMES UNINVITED ON OUR PHONES
POD0000004055_S0000104 SHE GETS OFF AT ABOUT THREE OR FOUR IN THE MORNING
POD0000004055_S0000109 YEAH OK SOME OF THIS THEY GET FROM INTERVIEWING HER SOME OF THIS THEY GET FROM SURVEILLANCE CAMERA FOOTAGE
POD0000004055_S0000117 BUT PEOPLE TALK
POD0000004055_S0000123 HOW DOES SHE KNOW THAT PERSON AND WHY DID SHE WAIT A WEEK AFTER SYMPTOMS TO GET TESTED MOST OF THESE COMMENTS SEEM TO BE POSTED ON ONLINE FORUMS IN A VERY POPULAR PORTAL CALLED NAVER NAVER IT'S LIKE THE GOOGLE OF SOUTH KOREA
POD0000004055_S0000131 HOW DOES IT HELP ME AVOID THE VIRUS TO KNOW THAT PATIENT FIFTEEN IS IN HER TWENTY S OR TO KNOW THAT SHE IS A SHE
POD0000004055_S0000141 THAT'S PRIVATE THAT'S CORRECT
POD0000004055_S0000149 SO IF YOU REMEMBER PATIENT FIFTEEN
POD0000004055_S0000161 THE SAFER I FEEL AND THE MORE I AM WILLING TO TRUST THE GOVERNMENT'S DIRECTIVES
POD0000004055_S0000169 APPLE AND GOOGLE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE DEVELOPING A CONTACT-TRACING TECHNOLOGY
POD0000004055_S0000181 LOOKS LIKE THE POLICE BASICALLY ROLLING UP AND YELLING AT YOU OVER THE LOUDSPEAKERS LIKE
POD0000004055_S0000191 WHETHER IT'S A SCHOOL KID OR A LABORER WHO'S LIKE TRYING TO SNEAK HOME ON A BUS
POD0000004055_S0000200 AND IT'S A PLACE WHERE BEFORE THE VIRUS
POD0000004055_S0000218 AND THE PERSON WE WERE INTERVIEWING WAS BETWEEN US BOTH AT A DISTANCE
POD0000004055_S0000230 SO EVERYONE JUST SORT OF LIKE
POD0000004055_S0000248 I THOUGHT BACK TO WHAT ANTHONY IN SOUTH KOREA TOLD ME ABOUT PATIENT FIFTEEN
POD0000004055_S0000253 MOST PEOPLE IN ISLAMABAD LIVE MORE LIKE IBRAHIM DOES IN CLOSE QUARTERS WHERE THE RULES OF SOCIAL DISTANCING ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PRACTICE
POD0000004055_S0000258 AND YOU CAN SEE IN THAT A SHARED COMMUNAL EXPECTATION OF WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN A CRISIS THE EXPECTATION IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS LOCKDOWN AFFECTS US ALL SO DIFFERENTLY
POD0000004055_S0000264 THE PRIME MINISTER IMRAN KHAN EXPLAINED WE ARE FACING CORONA CHALLENGE ON ONE HAND
POD0000004063_S0000011 I'D FIRST HEARD ABOUT RUSLAN'S PROJECT THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN UKRAINE FOR NPR ONE OF THE STORIES I WAS REPORTING WAS ABOUT HOW FAKE NEWS FROM RUSSIA WAS STREAMING OVER THE BORDER INTO UKRAINE
POD0000004063_S0000019 UKRAINE HAS DEALT WITH FAKE NEWS IN HIGHER DOSES THAN ALMOST ANYTHING WE CAN IMAGINE
POD0000004063_S0000036 MORE FRIENDLY
POD0000004063_S0000048 RUSLAN COULD LOOK OUT HIS WINDOW AND SEE THE STREETS WHERE PEACEFUL
POD0000004063_S0000059 I WAS IN FAVOR OF AS MUCH SOURCES OF INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE A UKRAINE THAT BANNED MEDIA
POD0000004063_S0000067 I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS WHAT SHOULD BE DONE
POD0000004063_S0000080 AND A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THAT A VERY SIMILAR CRUCIFIXION SCENE PLAYING OUT IN A SHOW THAT IS VERY POPULAR IN RUSSIA
POD0000004063_S0000090 GETTING HELP FROM RUSSIA THIS MORNING GUNMEN IN CAMOUFLAGE FATIGUES TOOK OVER RUSLAN WAS WATCHING HIS COUNTRY SPLIT IN TWO
POD0000004063_S0000096 NO THIS IS NOT TRUE
POD0000004063_S0000109 AND FOR RUSLAN THIS LITTLE MOMENT ON THE PHONE WITH THE RUSSIAN OFFICIAL
POD0000004063_S0000117 WHEN YOU DRIVE OUT TO THE FRONT LINES IN EASTERN UKRAINE YOU HAVE TO LEAVE EARLY
POD0000004063_S0000127 OH MY GOSH
POD0000004063_S0000143 THEY COME HERE TO RIB HIM WITH JOKES
POD0000004063_S0000150 HE READS THE NEWS ALL THE TIME BUT WHEN HE SEES A JOURNALIST COMING AROUND
POD0000004063_S0000171 FOR EXAMPLE IN AMERICA YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND A PARTY IN RUSSIA THE PARTY FINDS YOU
POD0000004063_S0000187 THE PRESS CONFERENCE IS ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT FRONT LINE
POD0000004063_S0000196 FOR RUSLAN IT'S THE RUSSIAN MICS THAT YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR THEY'RE THERE TO MAKE UKRAINE LOOK BAD
POD0000004063_S0000205 JUST CHALK IT UP TO ENEMY STRATEGY
POD0000004063_S0000214 IT ALSO OPENED HIS MIND TO THE POWER OF CENSORSHIP
POD0000004063_S0000232 IT MIGHT BE OK
POD0000004063_S0000238 THAT WAS NOT RIGHT
POD0000004063_S0000260 NEXT WEEK
POD0000004071_S0000010 AND IT HIT THE CAPITAL REGION SO JAKARTA IS AN ASIAN MEGACITY
POD0000004071_S0000016 THE ARMY STARTED BUILDING TENT CITIES TO KIND OF HOUSE DISPLACED PEOPLE
POD0000004071_S0000032 A VERY DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT JUST TRYING TO FIGHT THIS LINE OF FIRE THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU
POD0000004071_S0000046 BUT THE GOOD THING IS IS THAT SCIENTISTS ARE HOPING THEY CAN GET MORE HELPFUL INFORMATION SOON
POD0000004071_S0000057 WHEREAS AT THE SAME TIME AUSTRALIA IS IN THE MIDST OF THIS RECORD-BREAKING DROUGHT IT'S ALMOST AS IF CLIMATE CHANGE CAN CAUSE BOTH DROUGHT AND FLOODING IT'S ALMOST LIKE THAT BECKY
POD0000004071_S0000066 LIKE IMPORTANT
POD0000004071_S0000076 THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE OF JASON'S REPORTING FROM AUSTRALIA AS WELL AS SOME GREAT REPORTING FROM NPR'S ADRIAN FLORIDO WHO'S IN PUERTO RICO
POD0000004079_S0000013 AND WHEN I GOT BACK
POD0000004079_S0000024 AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY LIVE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOOD WEB THEY ARE FOOD FOR ALL THE MAMMALS AND THE BIRDS AND THE SNAKES AND THE PREDATORS
POD0000004079_S0000029 BUT NOBODY KNEW WHAT IT ALL MEANT NOBODY KNEW
POD0000004079_S0000040 NOBODY REALLY WITNESSED THEM IN THE ACT OF DYING
POD0000004079_S0000047 AND THEY CAN LOOK AT THEM AND SEE WHAT THEY HAVE KAREN SENT THE DEAD FROGS OFF TO A PATHOLOGIST TO BE TESTED
POD0000004079_S0000052 SCIENTISTS FROM ALL OVER WORKING IN COUNTRIES THOUSANDS OF MILES APART
POD0000004079_S0000058 THE CULPRIT IS A FUNGUS CHYTRID FUNGUS WE'RE NOT TALKING LIKE MUSHROOMS
POD0000004079_S0000065 WHICH MAKES IT EASIER FOR ORGANISMS LIKE CHYTRID FUNGUS TO HITCH A RIDE AND INFECT VULNERABLE HABITATS HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY
POD0000004079_S0000082 WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE MACAULAY LIBRARY AT THE CORNELL LAB OF ORNITHOLOGY FOR LOANING US AUDIO RECORDINGS OF THE FROG ISTHMOHYLA CALYPSA
POD0000004087_S0000015 ONE THAT COMBINED HER LOVE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE WITH HER LOVE OF POP CULTURE I HEARD YOU LOVE A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED MURDER MYSTERY OOH I DO SO MUCH
POD0000004087_S0000026 WHICH WE'LL GET TO A BIT LATER OK WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TELLTALE SIGNS THAT A SHOW OR A MOVIE IS GETTING FORENSICS RIGHT
POD0000004087_S0000033 BUT IT'S VERY KIND OF IN THE BACKGROUND
POD0000004087_S0000050 AND THEY ARE ALL MAGICALLY CONNECTED
POD0000004087_S0000074 AND A PERSON IS GOING TO IDENTIFY A SAMPLE A CHEMICAL A PERSON YEAH THEY DO THE WORK SO WHENEVER I SEE A SHOW THAT'S LIKE
POD0000004087_S0000085 I HAVE TO KNOW HOW
POD0000004087_S0000105 OF THE GENRE
POD0000004095_S0000016 AND THIS IS BECAUSE THEY HAD VERY LIMITED DIETS THEY ATE A LOT OF BREAD THAT WAS HIGH IN PHOSPHATE
POD0000004095_S0000024 BUT BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY S THE ROLE OF ZINC WAS NOT AT ALL UNDERSTOOD I MEAN PEOPLE THOUGHT PRASAD WAS CRAZY FOR JUST SUGGESTING THAT ZINC DEFICIENCY COULD DO THIS
POD0000004095_S0000034 PUMPKIN SEEDS A SINGLE OUNCE PROVIDES TWO POINT TWO MILLIGRAMS SO THAT'S A GOOD SOURCE
POD0000004095_S0000042 WHETHER ZINC SUPPLEMENTS MIGHT HELP TO SHORTEN THE DURATION AND SYMPTOMS OF A COMMON COLD
POD0000004095_S0000059 BE AWARE THAT A LOT OF INGREDIENTS CAN UNDERCUT THE EFFECTIVENESS FOR INSTANCE
POD0000004103_S0000012 AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU NURITH BUT TO ME THIS WAS THE MOMENT THAT YOU KNOW THIS SOMEWHAT OBSCURE CORNER OF SCIENCE THAT MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EXISTED KIND OF BLEW UP AND MODELS HAVE BEEN FRONT AND CENTER EVER SINCE THAT MOMENT
POD0000004103_S0000019 SO IT'S COMPLICATED AND IT'S ESPECIALLY COMPLICATED WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MODELING A NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN VIRAL PANDEMIC THE MODELING THAT DR BIRX SHOWED PREDICTS THAT NUMBER THAT YOU SAW
POD0000004103_S0000029 FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS SHOULD AND ARE USING QUITE A NUMBER OF THEM TO INFORM THEIR DECISIONS
POD0000004103_S0000038 AND UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON HOSPITALS WERE TRYING TO COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR THE SURGE OF PATIENTS THAT WERE COMING
POD0000004103_S0000050 IT DID HIT SOME COUNTRIES EARLIER THAN OURS
POD0000004103_S0000058 THE REST OF THE MODEL FITTING IS LOOKING AT HOW FAST THE EPIDEMIC IS GOING UP
POD0000004103_S0000067 SO IT PROBABLY WON'T HAVE THE SAME EFFECT
POD0000004103_S0000073 WE ARE LEARNING AS WE GO
POD0000004103_S0000083 THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WILL STILL NOT HAVE BEEN INFECTED THEY ARE STILL GOING TO BE VULNERABLE TO THIS VIRUS CORONAVIRUS COULD FLARE UP ALL OVER AGAIN
POD0000004103_S0000092 AND SO AGAIN THAT GETS AT THE POINT WE MADE BEFORE MODELS ARE FORECASTS THEY ARE NOT OUR FATE
POD0000004111_S0000011 THE SPOTTED LANTERNFLY YOU WENT TO PENNSYLVANIA TO CHECK THESE GUYS OUT YEAH
POD0000004111_S0000026 THEY DON'T HAVE ANY NATURAL ENEMIES
POD0000004111_S0000042 AND YOU OFTEN CAN'T PREDICT
POD0000004111_S0000057 IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE FOR THEM TO MAKE THEIR CASE TO THE REGULATORS THAT THIS IS SAFE TO RELEASE HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS THIS LIKE GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE OF THE SCALE SO THIS IS A REALLY HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER BECAUSE
POD0000004119_S0000004 ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD OF NANOTECHNOLOGY AND NOW THE TARGET OF A MAJOR GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION GOOD MORNING
POD0000004119_S0000016 NOTHING HE SHARED WAS CLASSIFIED OR RESTRICTED IN ANY WAY ACADEMIC ESPIONAGE IT'S A CONTRADICTION TO ME EVERYTHING WE ARE DOING IS FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
POD0000004119_S0000024 ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS IS REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE THEFT OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BY THE CHINESE
POD0000004119_S0000041 WHY ARE SCIENTISTS DOING THIS
POD0000004119_S0000048 THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT AGAINST CHARLES LIEBER ALLEGES AND I SHOULD SAY ALLEGES HERE THAT HE WAS RECEIVING CASH PAYMENTS FROM THE CHINESE THAT SOME OF THIS MONEY WAS JUST COMING AS STRAIGHT UP CASH OK SO THIS SOUNDS PROBLEMATIC FOR SURE
POD0000004119_S0000055 MAYBE YOU WOULD FACE SOME DISCIPLINE FROM YOUR EMPLOYER
POD0000004119_S0000061 WHEN YOU'RE OF CHINESE BACKGROUND
POD0000004119_S0000068 THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES
POD0000004119_S0000079 THIS EPISODE WAS PRODUCED BY BRIT HANSON EDITED BY VIET LE AND FACT-CHECKED BY EMILY VAUGHN
POD0000004127_S0000020 FOR US ALL FIGURING OUT WHAT TO ATTEND TO HOW MUCH WE SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT OR HOW HOPEFUL WE SHOULD BE ABOUT THE LATEST THING EVERYONE IS SAYING IS GOING TO BE THE SOLUTION HERE'S WHERE SOME SWEET SWEET DATA-DRIVEN SCIENCE COMMUNICATION COMES INTO IT
POD0000004127_S0000026 I'M MADDIE SOFIA AND THIS IS SHORT WAVE
POD0000004127_S0000034 ARE PAYING A LOT MORE ATTENTION TO YOU THEY'RE ALSO MUCH MORE LIKELY TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY
POD0000004127_S0000042 BUT TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT IN THIS CONTEXT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO SCIENCE COMMUNICATION
POD0000004127_S0000054 SOME OF IT'S REALLY WRONG
POD0000004127_S0000061 YOU KIND OF OPEN A DIALOGUE ABOUT THAT THING BUT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY SAY EXPLICITLY THE THING THAT IS INCORRECT THAT HAS BEEN CIRCULATING EXACTLY ALL RIGHT
POD0000004127_S0000071 EASTER WOULD COME AND GO AND EVENTUALLY THEY WOULD GIVE UP
POD0000004127_S0000080 EDITED BY VIET LE AND FACT-CHECKED BY EMILY VAUGHN
POD0000004135_S0000011 SO WE'VE BEEN BRAINSTORMING ALL MONTH ABOUT WHO'S THE RIGHT PERSON TO BREAK ALL THAT DOWN FOR YOU LISTENERS
POD0000004135_S0000021 ADAM WROTE AN ABSOLUTE BOP CALLED A NEUROSCIENCE LOVE SONG AND THUS BECAME THE DEFINITIVE VOICE OF LOVE FOR THE NPR SHORT WAVE TEAM WHEN YOU LOOKED IN MY DIRECTION
POD0000004135_S0000044 WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
POD0000004135_S0000066 JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHERS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT ROLES IN THE BODY
POD0000004135_S0000090 REDUCTION IN ACTIVITY IN MY
POD0000004143_S0000022 I'M MADDIE SOFIA AND THIS IS SHORT WAVE
POD0000004143_S0000029 COOLER ALL RIGHT Y'ALL YOU READY TO THROW DOWN READY YES READY SO AS YOU BOTH KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS FEEL YOU KNOW TOO COMPETITIVE IT'S JUST A LOW-KEY EASYGOING SCIENCE-BASED CONVERSATION ABOUT
POD0000004143_S0000048 IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THIS TINY LITTLE MOUSE EATING A BIRD WELL THEY DO ACTUALLY IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN'T HOUSE TWO MALES TOGETHER THE MALES ARE REALLY AGGRESSIVE
POD0000004143_S0000063 SO ASHLEE WHAT IS GOING ON
POD0000004143_S0000081 HE THROWS HIS TINY LITTLE MOUSE HEAD BACK
POD0000004143_S0000090 AND SCORPIONS ARE AMAZING IN THAT THEY KNOW WHEN THERE'S A PREDATOR AROUND
POD0000004151_S0000006 LIKE
POD0000004151_S0000026 AND SO THEN I JUST GOT WENT DOWN THIS RABBIT HOLE OF READING ABOUT THIS WEIRD TEST
POD0000004151_S0000036 SAW THAT IT FELL ON CHRISTMAS BREAK
POD0000004159_S0000015 AND SEEING WHERE IT WOULD GO AND ACTUALLY A NUMBER OF DOCTORS IMMEDIATELY STARTED PICKING IT UP AND STARTED USING IT AT LEAST ON THEIR MOST DESPERATELY ILL PATIENTS AND I TALKED TO ONE OF THEM THIS GUY WITH AN INCREDIBLE STORY NAMED KRISTOPHER KELLY WHO HAD THIS HORRIBLE LOGGING ACCIDENT THIS IS OUT IN SEATTLE I WAS CUTTING FOR A LOGGING OUTFIT UP ON THESE ROCK CLIFFS
POD0000004159_S0000034 AND THEN HE COMPARED IT TO FORTY SEVEN OTHER PATIENTS WHO HAD BEEN TREATED BEFORE HE CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA
POD0000004159_S0000055 IN THIS CASE EVERYONE AGREES WITH THE CLICHE THAT MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED SCIENCE SURE HAS A WAY OF MAKING US WAIT HUH RICHARD
POD0000004167_S0000007 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VICTORIA GRAY SHE'S THIRTY FOUR SHE LIVES IN MISSISSIPPI AND SHE HAS FOUR KIDS AND SHE HAS SICKLE CELL DISEASE
POD0000004167_S0000031 YOU CAN GO ON BACK NOW VICTORIA SHE FINDS AN EMPTY CHAIR SHE SITS DOWN SHE STRETCHES OUT HER ARM FOR THE NURSES
POD0000004167_S0000055 BUT THEY'RE NOT
POD0000004167_S0000071 THIS COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING SPECIAL
POD0000004175_S0000011 THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE'VE CREATED THAT IN TURN
POD0000004175_S0000018 DON'T GO HOME BECAUSE IN HER BOOK
POD0000004175_S0000026 I'VE BEEN HERE ABOUT TEN YEARS I NEVER HEARD OF WALLACE RIGHT AND I GO OVER TO THAT CITY NOBODY'S HEARD OF WALLACE HE'S BEEN COMPLETELY ERASED EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE HISTORY OF THE LIGHT BULB IS HOW ARTIFICIAL LIGHT HAS AFFECTED OUR LIVES OUR BODY HAS TWO MODES IT HAS A DAYTIME MODE AND A NIGHTTIME MODE
POD0000004175_S0000044 SHE'LL FLASH BACK I LIKE YOU AND THEN THEY GO MEET AND FUTURE FIREFLIES BUT WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT THE NUMBER OF FIREFLIES IS DECREASING AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE STREET LIGHTS
POD0000004175_S0000063 YOU KNOW AS FREQUENTLY FOR THEIR SUCCESSES AND THEIR FAILURES NOT JUST IN PERFECTING THEIR INVENTIONS BUT ALSO THEIR PERSONALITIES
POD0000004175_S0000077 AND YOU SWORE THAT YOU WOULD DO WHAT YOU COULD TO MAKE SURE NOBODY SUFFERED THROUGH SCIENCE LIKE THAT
POD0000004175_S0000082 AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I GOT TO THESE INTRODUCTORY CLASSES AT UNDERGRADUATE THAT ALL THE JOY WAS SQUEEZED OUT AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THEY HAD IN FACT WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL
POD0000004185_S0000009 HE'S STUDYING THE LIGHT COMING FROM THE CORONA AROUND THE SUN
POD0000004185_S0000024 SO THEY GO THROUGH THE WHOLE RIGMAROLE AND THEY SET THIS BALE OF HAY ON FIRE THAT THEY START PRODDING TOWARDS THE GAS
POD0000004185_S0000050 SO IT'S HELIUM
POD0000004185_S0000060 BUT THERE ARE ONLY REALLY THREE PLACES IN THE WORLD THAT PRODUCE MOST OF THE WORLD'S HELIUM ALGERIA QATAR AND THE U S
POD0000004185_S0000080 I MEAN YOU HAVE NATURE'S SCISSORS
POD0000004193_S0000005 AND WHEN YOU DONATE TO A LOCAL NPR STATION
POD0000004193_S0000013 IT REMINDS ME THAT I'M JUST MADELINE KELLY SOFIA
POD0000004193_S0000020 YOU KNOW ON SOME SCALE HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE LIKE OH WAIT WE ACTUALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND LIKE
POD0000004193_S0000047 SO THAT MEANS THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NOT STATIC IT'S IN FACT EXPANDING AND AT THIS POINT WE THINK THAT THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING BUT THAT THAT EXPANSION IS SLOWING DOWN
POD0000004193_S0000059 I THINK THE ONLY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE DON'T KNOW OH COME ON SARAFINA
POD0000004193_S0000079 WE CAN DETERMINE THE DISTANCE TO THE SUPERNOVA AND DETERMINE HOW FAST THAT GALAXY THAT HOSTS THE SUPERNOVA IS EXPANDING AWAY FROM US
POD0000004193_S0000087 AND IT'S GOING TO BE A COLD
POD0000004193_S0000099 SEE YOU TOMORROW
POD0000004201_S0000017 BUT ONLY THIS ONE HAS CAUSED A PANDEMIC
POD0000004201_S0000026 YEAH WE THINK ED IN YOUR PIECE YOU SUGGESTED THAT SOME OF THE VIROLOGISTS THAT STUDY THESE FAMILIES OF VIRUSES HAVE STARTED CALLING THE SARS VIRUS SARS CLASSIC
POD0000004201_S0000045 YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
POD0000004201_S0000062 ONE EPIDEMIOLOGIST EXPLAINED IT TO ME LIKE THIS IT'S AS IF THE WORLD IS JUST FULL OF TINDER AND YOU'VE GOT THIS GIGANTIC WILDFIRE THAT'S BLAZING THROUGH IT
POD0000004201_S0000073 ED YONG
POD0000004209_S0000024 OK SO THE MIC IS ON
POD0000004209_S0000049 SO IF YOU'RE NOT USING A SCRIPT AND YOU'RE GIVING A PRESENTATION IN A CLASS
POD0000004209_S0000068 OK
POD0000004221_S0000006 AND NOW ON WITH TODAY'S SHOW
POD0000004221_S0000016 THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO REOPEN AND THEIR WORKERS WILL BE LEFT WITHOUT JOBS BUT BEYOND THOSE BIG HEADLINE NUMBERS THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT
POD0000004221_S0000024 WAS GENERAL MERCHANDISE STORES
POD0000004221_S0000031 THOSE SEVEN ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT ADDED JOBS LAST MONTH AND SO THE FACT THAT WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO ADD JOBS IN SO FEW OF THEM
POD0000004221_S0000041 BENGA SAYS THAT IS PROBABLY NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW
POD0000004221_S0000049 THAT'S THE DROP IN ONE MONTH
POD0000004229_S0000006 AND IT HAS INNOVATIVE COMPANIES THAT ARE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD
POD0000004229_S0000011 APPEARS TO BE IN DECLINE
POD0000004229_S0000022 IS FALLING FIRST INDICATOR THE STARTUP RATE
POD0000004229_S0000037 THEY DIDN'T JUST BANKRUPT BLOCKBUSTER
POD0000004229_S0000047 FAST FORWARD TO LAST YEAR AND IT WAS ONLY ELEVEN PERCENT OF THOSE WORKERS WHO SWITCHED JOBS
POD0000004229_S0000062 THEN THAT MIGHT STOP WORKERS FROM SWITCHING TO NEW JOBS IN OTHER STATES
POD0000004229_S0000069 SO REVERSING THE DECLINE IN DYNAMISM MIGHT ALSO HELP THE COUNTRY REDISCOVER ITS IDENTITY
POD0000004237_S0000018 THE EFFECTS OF THAT BOOST ARE OF COURSE STARTING TO WEAR OFF BUT THAT WAS EXPECTED IT DOES NOT MEAN THE ECONOMY IS IN BAD SHAPE OK SECOND POINT
POD0000004237_S0000030 THE ECONOMY MIGHT HAVE JUST HIT A TEMPORARY ROUGH PATCH BEFORE IT STARTS RECOVERING AND THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST DECADE
POD0000004237_S0000038 AND THE SIGNS OF THAT ARE ENCOURAGING WAGE GROWTH HAS BEEN ACCELERATING FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS
POD0000004237_S0000043 NOW THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE IN THE PAST THE ECONOMY HAS FOLLOWED WHEREVER THE HOUSING MARKET HAS LED
POD0000004237_S0000051 HOUSING MIGHT NO LONGER BE SUCH A RELIABLE SIGNAL OF WHERE THE ECONOMY IS HEADED
POD0000004245_S0000011 OR IS THAT A BAD IDEA BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE MARKETS CAN'T KEEP THIS UP
POD0000004245_S0000018 YOU HAVE A MEDITATION BELL CARDIFF GARCIA I HAD A FEELING WE MIGHT NEED IT FOR THIS SHOW
POD0000004245_S0000028 YOU KNOW THE MARKET IS JUST ABOUT TO CRASH AND THEN ALL THIS STUFF HAPPENED THAT SEEMED LIKE IT WOULD KIND OF BACK THAT UP
POD0000004245_S0000041 BUT IN A LOT OF CASES THESE CHANGES HAVE HAPPENED OVER YEARS AND YEARS SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY NOTICE THEM
POD0000004245_S0000050 FINANCIAL ADVISERS AND GURUS ARE NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE NEWS BY SAYING
POD0000004245_S0000057 HERE'S THE THING
POD0000004253_S0000023 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THIS BIG PRICING DISCONNECT
POD0000004253_S0000037 YOU KNOW KEEP CONSTRUCTION WORKERS' HANDS WARM
POD0000004253_S0000043 AND SO THERE'S THIS DISCONNECT THIS DISCONNECT SO NOW WE COME TO THE REASON THAT PRICES ARE GOING UP IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT COFFEE BEANS ARE GETTING CHEAPER
POD0000004261_S0000004 THE ECONOMIC HARM IS ALREADY HAPPENING THE VIRUS AND THE MEASURES THAT ARE BEING TAKEN TO CONTAIN IT WILL SURELY WEIGH ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BOTH HERE AND ABROAD FOR SOME TIME
POD0000004261_S0000011 THEY'VE REPORTED HUNDREDS IN SOME CASES THOUSANDS OF CONFIRMED CORONAVIRUS CASES AS HAS ITALY MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND CASES OF CORONAVIRUS HAVE NOW BEEN REPORTED THERE
POD0000004261_S0000023 ITALY IS A DISASTER BUT MILAN IS GREAT
POD0000004261_S0000038 WHICH ARE SUPPLY CHAIN AND GLOBAL DEMAND
POD0000004261_S0000049 IT'S NOW
POD0000004261_S0000054 IN A NORMAL UNION WOULD BE THE UNION INTERVENING
POD0000004269_S0000016 WELL IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE DIET AND TO CHANGE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS A DANGEROUS ROAD TO DEFICITS
POD0000004269_S0000032 DO I WISH THE DEFICIT WAS SMALLER YES
POD0000004269_S0000040 A DEFICIT MEANS YOU'RE SPENDING MONEY YOU'RE CUTTING TAXES
POD0000004269_S0000050 THEN
POD0000004269_S0000059 IF YOUR INTEREST RATE IS LOWER THAN YOUR GROWTH RATE
POD0000004277_S0000003 RIGHT YEAH
POD0000004277_S0000021 BUT CRYPTOCURRENCIES GENERALLY AREN'T BACKED BY GOVERNMENTS
POD0000004277_S0000029 FACEBOOK ALREADY HAS THIS BIG ECOSYSTEM OF USERS WHO MIGHT SEE VALUE IN BEING ABLE TO BUY THINGS INSIDE OF FACEBOOK WITH A FACEBOOK-ISSUED CURRENCY
POD0000004277_S0000039 YOU DON'T SAY PORTAL ANYMORE
POD0000004277_S0000055 MATI GREENSPAN IS AN ANALYST AT ETORO A BROKERAGE THAT HELPS PEOPLE INVEST IN CRYPTOCURRENCY
POD0000004277_S0000062 HECK NO I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG ALONG THE WAY AND IT'S NOT JUST THE REGULATORY HURDLES MATI SAYS THERE COULD BE A PROBLEM GETTING PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY USE THE LIBRA
POD0000004285_S0000008 SO WHAT DANA IS DESCRIBING LIKE CHEAP HIP CLOTHES THAT FALL APART VERY QUICKLY IT'S FROM A PART OF THE WORLD RETAIL KNOWN AS FAST-FASHION
POD0000004285_S0000018 IT'S GUILT
POD0000004285_S0000029 STAY TUNED
POD0000004285_S0000040 YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT H AND M HAS A WHOLE OTHER SIDE THE CLOTHES THE COMPANY IS RENTING COME FROM ITS CONSCIOUS EXCLUSIVE COLLECTIONS
POD0000004285_S0000050 THINGS LIKE HOW TO CLEAN YOUR SHOELACES OR MEND YOUR JEANS
POD0000004285_S0000055 ALL KINDS OF BRANDS ARE TRYING TO BE SEEN AS MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS AND TO MAKE THEIR CONSUMERS FEEL LESS GUILTY
POD0000004293_S0000038 THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
POD0000004293_S0000045 YOU'RE FINE IF YOUR MONEY IS INVESTED IN GOLD YOU CAN TAKE THAT GOLD TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND YOU'RE STILL WEALTHY AND THIS IS WHY DURING TIMES WHEN PEOPLE FEEL UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE FUTURE OR WORRIED THAT THE ECONOMY MIGHT GO SOUTH
POD0000004293_S0000060 A LOT OF YOUNGER INVESTORS WHO WANT AN INDEPENDENT
POD0000004301_S0000008 BUT THERE'S ANOTHER THEORY THAT HASN'T GOTTEN AS MUCH ATTENTION
POD0000004301_S0000018 SAME FOUR PEOPLE
POD0000004301_S0000026 AND THOSE WORKERS WORK THE SAME NUMBER OF HOURS
POD0000004301_S0000035 KIND OF LIKE THE MUSICIANS IN A STRING QUARTET
POD0000004301_S0000040 YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT YOUR DAUGHTER'S GRADE SCHOOL TEACHER TO BE MORE EFFICIENT BY SPENDING LESS TIME TEACHING HER IN THE CLASSROOM
POD0000004301_S0000046 THE BUSINESSES THAT HIRE THEM THE SCHOOLS THE COLLEGES THE HOSPITALS THEY HAVE TO RAISE THEIR PRICES SO THEY CAN AFFORD TO PAY THOSE RISING SALARIES YEAH AND WHEN ALEX ANALYZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION SECTORS
POD0000004301_S0000056 HE'S CERTAINLY NOT SAYING THAT THESE SYSTEMS TREAT EVERYBODY FAIRLY
POD0000004301_S0000061 IT'S NOT A JUDGMENT ABOUT THE BEST WAYS TO RUN THESE SECTORS AND BY THE WAY ALEX SAYS THAT JUST BECAUSE THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION HAVE BEEN RISING SO MUCH MORE THAN OTHER COSTS FOR SUCH A LONG TIME DOESN'T MEAN THE TREND WILL LAST FOREVER
POD0000004309_S0000006 I'M SMART
POD0000004309_S0000011 BUT HOW CAN WE IDENTIFY THE PRECISE EFFECTS OF STORIES ON OUR ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR
POD0000004309_S0000024 WITH VIEWS OF THE WORLD HOW IT WORKS IT'S A
POD0000004309_S0000033 WE HAVE TO KNOW HOW THEY'RE CHANGING THEIR THINKING
POD0000004309_S0000042 THE STORY CHANGED AND THAT IN PART IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
POD0000004309_S0000053 AND THEY CAN TRY TO REFLECT ON WHY IT DIDN'T WORK THEN
POD0000004309_S0000062 THEY CAN GO OUT FURTHER THAN THE WEATHER PEOPLE CAN
POD0000004309_S0000072 THAT'S RIGHT WELL THIS ALSO BRINGS UP THE SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY STORY
POD0000004309_S0000085 RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE DO THAT YOU DON'T JUST HAVE A FORECAST FOR A RECESSION A CONSENSUS FORECAST
POD0000004317_S0000005 THAT STATISTIC COMES FROM CHARLES KENNY HE'S A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CENTER FOR GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT
POD0000004317_S0000016 NATURAL CAPITAL THINGS LIKE LAND AND OIL AND GOLD SO LAND AND THE STUFF UNDER IT
POD0000004317_S0000040 THAT MEANT THAT THAT COUNTRY WAS RICHER THAN OTHER COUNTRIES AND SO THERE WERE THESE KINDS OF IMPERIAL YOU KNOW CONQUESTS AND SQUABBLES OVER LAND ITSELF
POD0000004317_S0000054 THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE YOU KNOW
POD0000004325_S0000010 SO TODAY ON THE SHOW OUR CHAT WITH JACOB ABOUT HOW BAD THINGS WOULD GET FOR THE LOS ANGELES ECONOMY AND FOR LOS ANGELES WHEN THE BIG ONE HITS AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO PREPARE
POD0000004325_S0000023 YOU WOULD PROBABLY SEE A LOT OF THE TRAFFIC COME TO A STANDSTILL
POD0000004325_S0000033 SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IS BASICALLY ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY IN THE REGION IT WILL COME TO SOME LEVEL OF A STANDSTILL FOR A PERIOD OF TIME
POD0000004325_S0000044 SO ALL THE SCIENTISTS THAT WE TALKED TO AND RESEARCH THAT WE LOOKED AT SHOWS THAT INEQUALITY WILL BE EXACERBATED BY THE BIG ONE
POD0000004325_S0000057 THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE
POD0000004325_S0000069 THE BIG EARTHQUAKE ODDS ARE IS GOING TO HIT BEFORE THEN SO
POD0000004333_S0000016 I'M SALLY HERSHIPS AND I'M CARDIFF GARCIA TODAY ON THE SHOW
POD0000004333_S0000025 THERE IS EVEN A JAPANESE WORD FOR IT KAROSHI
POD0000004333_S0000035 THERE ARE THOSE LONG HOURS NOT TO MENTION JAPANESE DADS HELP AROUND THE HOUSE LESS THAN DADS IN OTHER RICH COUNTRIES
POD0000004333_S0000044 SO THERE'S THIS GROUP OF PERMANENT FULL-TIME JOBS AND THESE JOBS TEND TO BE MORE DEMANDING WHERE YOU'RE EXPECTED TO STAY TILL ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND GO DRINKING WITH THE BOSS
POD0000004333_S0000049 AND THIS IS WHAT JAPAN IS HOPING TO CHANGE WITH ITS OVERTIME CAP BUT MAKING THESE KINDS OF CHANGES COULD BE REALLY TOUGH EVEN IF THEY'RE WRITTEN INTO LAW HERE'S HOW THE NEW LEGISLATION WORKS IF YOU ARE A JAPANESE WORKER YOU ARE ALLOWED TO WORK NO MORE THAN FORTY FIVE HOURS OF OVERTIME A MONTH
POD0000004333_S0000062 HE KNOWS IT
POD0000004341_S0000012 SO WORKERS ARE CONSIDERED PART TIME WHEN THEY WORK FEWER THAN THIRTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK
POD0000004341_S0000020 SO IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY'RE MAKING LESS BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING FEWER HOURS PER WEEK WE WOULD ALL EXPECT THAT
POD0000004341_S0000029 JOBS WHERE IT'S HARD TO TRADE A SHIFT WITH ANOTHER WORKER FOR EXAMPLE SALESPEOPLE AND ALSO JOBS LIKE LAWYER AND BANKER
POD0000004341_S0000037 AND REGISTERED NURSE BY THE WAY IS ONE OF THE JOBS THAT PAYS A PART-TIME PREMIUM OR YOU CAN ALSO THINK OF WAITERS AND WAITRESSES THAT ALSO HAVE A RELATIVELY LOW PENALTY
POD0000004341_S0000043 MARTHA SAYS THAT THIS FACT HAS AT LEAST ONE BIG SOCIETAL IMPLICATION
POD0000004349_S0000013 THAT IS CONSUMPTION BUYING A LOT OF CRAP OR YOU CAN SAVE IT
POD0000004349_S0000024 THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE AFRAID TO SPEND ANY MORE MONEY IF THE ECONOMY STARTS LOOKING SHAKY BECAUSE YOU'LL BE WORRIED ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY OFF YOUR DEBTS IF YOU LOSE YOUR JOB OR YOU'LL BE WORRIED THAT YOU WON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY SAVED TO GET YOU THROUGH THE HARD TIMES
POD0000004349_S0000029 BUT THAT'S ONLY ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF PEOPLE SAVING MONEY
POD0000004349_S0000036 OR MAYBE YOU'LL JUST PUT THE MONEY INTO A BANK AND THAT MAKES IT EASIER FOR THE BANK TO LOAN OUT MONEY TO COMPANIES THAT NEED TO BORROW IT SO TO SUM THINGS UP IT'S A BALANCE FOR A HEALTHY ECONOMY YOU NEED PLENTY OF CONSUMPTION BECAUSE IT KEEPS BUSINESSES GOING AND IT GIVES PEOPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK AT THOSE BUSINESSES
POD0000004349_S0000042 AND THESE ARE GENERALLY GOOD SIGNS THEY SUGGEST CROSS YOUR FINGERS HERE KNOCK ON WOOD THAT IF THE ECONOMY GOES INTO RECESSION SOON
POD0000004349_S0000052 PLUS THERE'S THE LONGER FREAKONOMICS RADIO PODCAST WHICH COMES OUT EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS
POD0000004357_S0000012 THAT'S ACCORDING TO SHEILA KRUMHOLZ EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIVE POLITICS
POD0000004357_S0000021 YOU NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT TO BE CONSIDERED A FINANCIALLY VIABLE CANDIDATE
POD0000004357_S0000027 MONEY ISN'T JUST ABOUT BUYING STUFF RIGHT CAMPAIGN MONEY HAS A BIG SIGNALING EFFECT WHEN A CANDIDATE GETS A LOT OF MONEY IT FIRST OF ALL WILL GET SOME MEDIA COVERAGE
POD0000004357_S0000037 AND THOSE CAN COST TENS OR EVEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
POD0000004357_S0000044 ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIVE POLITICS
POD0000004357_S0000051 BASED ON HAVING OBSERVED THE WAY MONEY WAS SPENT TRYING TO GET JEB BUSH ELECTED MOST MONEY WAS SPENT POSITIONING JEB AGAINST RUBIO
POD0000004357_S0000058 IT WORKED FOR A REALITY TV STAR WHO SAID REALLY INFLAMMATORY THINGS
POD0000004365_S0000021 WHEN THERE'S AN EVENT OCCURRING THEY LOOK BACK AND TRY TO FIND AN ANALOG A SIMILAR EVENT
POD0000004365_S0000045 WHY DOES A DECLINE IN OIL PRICES LIKE THIS
POD0000004365_S0000062 NO OK CORONAVIRUS IS EXACERBATING THIS
POD0000004373_S0000012 AS LONG AS THE ECONOMIC SHUTDOWN CONTINUES AND PEOPLE ARE AVOIDING CROWDS THERE EFFECTIVELY IS NO PERFORMING ARTS INDUSTRY
POD0000004373_S0000023 WHICH MEANS THAT PLANNING A SHOW IS A MASSIVE LOGISTICAL UNDERTAKING IT ALSO MEANS THAT WHEN A SHOW IS CANCELED IT CAN'T JUST BE STARTED UP AGAIN BY YOU KNOW TURNING THE THEATER'S LIGHTS BACK ON
POD0000004373_S0000030 SHE SAYS THAT SHE FEELS REALLY LUCKY THAT THIS WORK IS STILL AVAILABLE FOR HER
POD0000004373_S0000041 BE INSPIRED TO SEE SOME OF THESE THINGS LIVE THAT THEY'RE ENGAGING WITH THROUGH MEDIA OF COURSE THE PERFORMING ARTS INDUSTRY IS OLD IT'S ANCIENT YOU ONLY HAVE TO VISIT THE RUINS OF AN ANCIENT GREEK THEATER TO SEE THIS AND THE INDUSTRY HAS SURVIVED PLENTY OF PANDEMICS THAT CAME BEFORE
POD0000004381_S0000007 YOU NEED ARMED GUARDS YOU NEED FENCES SO OLIVER AND HIS TEAM AT THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY STARTED TO THINK ABOUT A DIFFERENT WAY TO RAISE MONEY FOR RHINOS
POD0000004381_S0000020 YOU MAKE WIDGETS
POD0000004381_S0000027 THEY EXPECT THERE TO BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MORE RHINOS OF THAT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY ADDITIONAL RHINOS
POD0000004381_S0000037 GOVERNMENTS AND FOUNDATIONS HAVE BEEN DONATING MONEY WITH NO GUARANTEE OF RESULTS
POD0000004381_S0000043 THEY WILL PAY BACK THE INVESTORS WHO BOUGHT THE BONDS
POD0000004381_S0000048 BECAUSE INVESTORS WILL WANT TO SEE WHERE THEIR MONEY HAS GONE
POD0000004389_S0000016 AND THAT WAS A GOOD DAY THAT PRICE WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN ANALYSTS WERE EXPECTING
POD0000004389_S0000023 WHAT EXACTLY IS A DIRECT PUBLIC OFFERING
POD0000004389_S0000034 OK
POD0000004389_S0000041 THEN WHY SHOULD I PAY MORGAN STANLEY OR GOLDMAN SACHS FOUR TO SEVEN PERCENT OF THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT I'M RAISING TO SELL IT
POD0000004389_S0000048 AND WITH YOUR WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN
POD0000004389_S0000057 THEY ARE BOTH VERY WELL-RECOGNIZED AND THEY ALSO ARE BOTH WELL-CAPITALIZED THEY DON'T NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ANYTIME SOON
POD0000004389_S0000064 IN OTHER WORDS
POD0000004397_S0000008 I THINK THE BEST WAY TO ILLUSTRATE THIS IS TO COMPARE IT TO SOME OF ITS TOP COMPETITORS TAKE MCDONALD'S THERE ARE FOURTEEN THOUSAND MCDONALD'S IN THE UNITED STATES
POD0000004397_S0000021 BUT THEN
POD0000004397_S0000039 SUBWAY TRIED TO CLING TO THE FIVE-DOLLAR FOOTLONG
POD0000004397_S0000045 I THINK IF THEY WANT TO STICK WITH A FIVE-DOLLAR SANDWICH THEY SHOULD COME UP WITH A SMALLER VERSION
POD0000004405_S0000009 IT WAS A TOUR GROUP CANCELING
POD0000004405_S0000017 AND WITH NO INCOME ON THE HORIZON AND THE TOUR INDUSTRY JUST LOOKING LIKE IT MIGHT BE VERY SLOW TO COME BACK
POD0000004405_S0000029 AND SHE STARTED TO THINK ABOUT HER SITUATION YOU KNOW THE TOUR BUSINESS DID NOT SEEM LIKE IT WAS GOING TO COME BACK FOR A LONG TIME A LOT OF HER DEBT WAS ON CREDIT CARDS AND THAT DEBT COMES WITH A REALLY HIGH INTEREST RATE
POD0000004405_S0000038 MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE SKIPPED CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS
POD0000004405_S0000047 ON ONE HAND YOUR CREDIT SCORE TAKES A BIG HIT AND A BANKRUPTCY WILL TYPICALLY STAY ON YOUR CREDIT REPORT FOR SEVEN TO TEN YEARS
POD0000004405_S0000053 NOT FILING THERE'S THAT FEAR OF
POD0000004405_S0000060 LIKE THERE'S LIKE THE RED B ON YOUR CHEST
POD0000004405_S0000068 THIS IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF ALL THINGS OF OUR NATION
POD0000004413_S0000014 AND EVENTUALLY CITIGROUP CAME AROUND IT SET UP AN ORGANIZATION WITH OTHER BANKS THAT WOULD LIMIT LENDING TO PROJECTS THAT WOULD DAMAGE THE RAINFOREST THIS IS THE INDICATOR FROM PLANET MONEY
POD0000004413_S0000028 AND THAT MONEY OFTEN COMES IN THE FORM OF FINANCING AND LOANS FROM BANKS
POD0000004413_S0000035 THERE WAS ENORMOUS PRESSURE ON BANKS TO STOP LENDING THE SOUTH AFRICAN THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES
POD0000004413_S0000042 IT COULD TOTALLY DEVASTATE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS THOUSANDS OF JOBS GLOBAL TRADE TRAVEL GETTING FOOD TO PEOPLE WHO NEED FOOD
POD0000004413_S0000052 FLOWS OF MONEY WOULD STOP HEADING FOR COAL AND GAS AND OIL AND HEAD MUCH MORE DIRECTLY INTO SUN AND WIND
POD0000004421_S0000012 SO IF THE CURRENT EXPANSION THE ONE WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW DOES LAST INTO JULY
POD0000004421_S0000018 AND ACTUALLY
POD0000004421_S0000029 AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S NOT BAD THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN GOING UP FOR MOST OF THE EXPANSION
POD0000004421_S0000036 AND THE PERSONAL SAVINGS RATE IS TWICE AS HIGH NOW AS IT WAS BEFORE THE RECESSION STARTED
POD0000004421_S0000044 AND THERE ARE BIG EXCEPTIONS TO THIS TREND LIKE FOR EXAMPLE STUDENT LOAN DEBT HAS GONE WAY UP IN THE PAST TEN YEARS
POD0000004421_S0000053 AND THE STOCK MARKET HAS ACTUALLY QUADRUPLED SINCE IT HIT ITS BOTTOM DURING THE RECESSION
POD0000004421_S0000059 DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE FINE PRINT THIS IS A MEASURE OF INCOME INEQUALITY THE DIFFERENCE IN HOW MUCH MONEY IS EARNED BY PEOPLE WHO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY PEOPLE WHO MAKE MIDDLE-CLASS INCOMES AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOWER INCOMES AND WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT INCOME INEQUALITY HAD BEEN RISING FOR SEVERAL DECADES BEFORE THE RECESSION HIT
POD0000004421_S0000067 AND IT MEANS THAT THE U S IS NOW THE SINGLE BIGGEST PRODUCER OF CRUDE OIL IN THE WORLD BIGGER THAN BOTH SAUDI ARABIA AND RUSSIA AFTER PASSING THEM BOTH LAST YEAR THIS IS A MONUMENTAL CHANGE AND IT'S THE RESULT OF THE FRACKING INDUSTRY'S SUCCESS
POD0000004421_S0000073 AND IT DOESN'T REALLY EVEN HAVE TO DO WITH THE U S
POD0000004421_S0000079 AND YES IT HAS INVOLVED A FAIR BIT OF LUCK BUT IT HAS ALSO INVOLVED SOME TIMELY POLICYMAKING THAT HAS HELPED KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING DURING THOSE TIMES WHEN IT NEEDED JUICING
POD0000004429_S0000015 IF THE FED IS NOT CAREFUL IN EXPLAINING WHY IT IS BOOSTING AN ECONOMY THAT ALREADY SEEMS TO BE HEALTHY
POD0000004429_S0000021 AND SHE SAID THERE ARE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THE PUBLIC MIGHT INTERPRET A FED DECISION TO BOOST THE ECONOMY LATER THIS YEAR SO THE COMMUNICATION BECOMES CRITICAL HOW DOES THE FED TALK ABOUT A RATE CUT WHY EXACTLY IS THE FED DOING IT
POD0000004429_S0000026 THE PUBLIC MIGHT THINK THAT THE FED IS PANICKING THAT IT IS BOOSTING THE ECONOMY BECAUSE IT THINKS THE ECONOMY IS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE AND I THINK IF THE FED WERE TO TAKE SUCH AN ACTION
POD0000004429_S0000032 ESPECIALLY SINCE ANY DECISION BY THE FED NORMALLY TAKES A LITTLE WHILE TO AFFECT THE ECONOMY MONETARY POLICY ACTS WITH A LAG
POD0000004429_S0000043 THE FED EVENTUALLY WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT WANTS TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY BY LOWERING INTEREST RATES
POD0000004429_S0000048 AND LIKE ANY TOOL IT CAN BE USED
POD0000004437_S0000009 HE TOOK THAT CITY TO COURT
POD0000004437_S0000017 AND THE LEGAL BATTLE THAT IS CURRENTLY ROILING THIS IDYLLIC LITTLE BEACH CITY
POD0000004437_S0000031 WE DON'T NEED GIANT BUILDINGS THE PREVIOUS COUNCIL SOLD THE CITY DOWN THE RIVER
POD0000004437_S0000037 HUNTINGTON BEACH FELL OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THAT PLAN FOR DECADES THOUGH THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE I MEAN THIS LAW HAS GONE LARGELY UNENFORCED FOR FIFTY YEARS CITIES HAVE NEVER FACED ANY CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT ACTUALLY BUILDING THE HOUSES
POD0000004437_S0000042 MAYOR PETERSON THINKS THAT THIS LATEST LEGAL CHALLENGE
POD0000004437_S0000051 IN FACT HE DOESN'T LIVE IN HUNTINGTON BEACH ANYMORE
POD0000004445_S0000011 OR TO PUT THIS ANOTHER WAY
POD0000004445_S0000018 FOR EXAMPLE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN RESTAURANTS OR IN BARS OR IN RETAIL STORES
POD0000004445_S0000023 NOW THIS CAN BE KIND OF A HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER
POD0000004445_S0000031 WE BRING THE DISMAL
POD0000004445_S0000037 JUST WAY TOO EARLY TO KNOW BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO BLIP WATCH YEAH
POD0000004453_S0000011 WHY IS THE MARKET FOR MUNICIPAL BONDS SO HOT RIGHT NOW
POD0000004453_S0000030 AND THAT X AMOUNT OF INCOME HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT WITH THE NEGATIVE YIELDING BONDS GLOBALLY
POD0000004453_S0000042 IS THAT CORPORATIONS HAVE TAKEN ON SO MUCH DEBT
POD0000004453_S0000052 YOU HAVE MANY OF THOSE
POD0000004461_S0000005 AND THOSE CHANGES ARE SURE TO BE AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA FOR OPEC'S BIG MEETING NEXT WEEK OPEC IS A GROUP OF OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES BASICALLY HEADED BY SAUDI ARABIA
POD0000004461_S0000019 BUT IN THE PAST WE USED TO IMPORT ABOUT HALF OF THE OIL WE CONSUME
POD0000004461_S0000027 PRODUCING SO MUCH MORE OIL THAN IT USED TO LIKE HOW MUCH DOWNWARD PRESSURE DOES THAT PUT ON THE PRICE OF OIL
POD0000004461_S0000037 AGAIN NOW THAT WE'RE ONLY IMPORTING ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF OUR OIL
POD0000004469_S0000004 AND HERE IN NEW YORK
POD0000004469_S0000011 AND ALL OF THIS ACTIVITY IS COMING TO A SUDDEN STOP IN THE U S JUST LIKE IT HAS IN OTHER COUNTRIES
POD0000004469_S0000021 BUT THEN AFTER THE SECOND MONTH
POD0000004469_S0000031 WELL IN THAT RECESSION
POD0000004469_S0000038 WORKERS PAYING THEIR RENT AND BUYING STUFF FROM OTHER BUSINESSES AND SO ON
POD0000004469_S0000043 THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE HARD TO REBUILD AND THAT WILL DELAY THE ECONOMY'S ABILITY TO RECOVER TO UNDERSTAND THIS PIERRE SAYS LET'S SAY YOU'RE A WORKER WHO GETS LAID OFF BY YOUR BUSINESS SO NOW YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED
POD0000004469_S0000049 THE BANK MIGHT JUST SAY NO WE'RE NOT RENEWING THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SEEING YOU SELLING ANYTHING SO WE'RE CUTTING DOWN YOUR CREDIT LINE SO NOW YOU HAVE TO REPAY
POD0000004469_S0000056 THEN THOSE NETWORKS HAVE A CHANCE OF STAYING RESILIENT UNTIL THE CRISIS IS OVER
POD0000004469_S0000064 THERE WOULD BE MUCH LESS OF A NEED TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T JUST PRESERVE THESE RELATIONSHIPS SO FAR THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS TAKEN STEPS TO SUPPORT THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN THE HOPES THAT CREDIT STAYS CHEAP AND ACCESSIBLE FOR BUSINESSES WHO NEED TO BORROW MONEY
POD0000004477_S0000006 AND NOW ON WITH TODAY'S SHOW
POD0000004477_S0000012 YOU PLACE AN ORDER WARBY PARKER MAILS YOUR GLASSES TO YOUR HOUSE
POD0000004477_S0000018 FROM ONE STAGE OF COMPLETION TO THE NEXT
POD0000004477_S0000024 AND WORKERS ALSO HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS OF COVID OR HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO SOMEONE WHO HAD COVID
POD0000004477_S0000030 CORPORATE OFFICES HAVE SOME SIMILAR ISSUES TO MANUFACTURING FACILITIES FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF THEM ARE OPEN-PLAN OFFICES
POD0000004477_S0000045 DAVE SAYS WARBY PARKER IS ALSO BUILDING SOME NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD HELP
POD0000004477_S0000053 IT MIGHT JUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW SUCCESSFUL THE WORLD WILL BE IN FIGHTING COVID NINETEEN ITSELF
POD0000004485_S0000019 PEOPLE MIGHT START AVOIDING MOVIE THEATERS AND THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY SHOW UP AS A FALL IN THE BOX OFFICE NUMBERS SO WHAT DO THOSE BOX OFFICE NUMBERS SHOW SO FAR WELL THE THE BOX OFFICE SALES SHOWS US THE MOVIE THEATERS ARE DOING FINE
POD0000004485_S0000030 ECONO-JARGON SPEAK FOR IT'S GOTTEN WORSE YES IT'S ECONO-JARGON FOR WORSE OK IN OTHER WORDS THE OCCUPANCY RATE IS LOWER THAN WE HAD EXPECTED BUT ONLY BY A COUPLE PERCENT
POD0000004485_S0000041 SO THAT'S BEEN RUNNING AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND A WEEK
POD0000004485_S0000049 WE'LL POST LINKS TO ALL OF THEM AT NPR DOT ORG SLASH MONEY
POD0000004493_S0000016 BUT OF COURSE THIS COULD NOT OCCUR IF WHITES CONTINUED TO EXCLUDE BLACK WORKERS FROM HAVING THE RIGHT TO WORK
POD0000004493_S0000021 THEN NOT ONLY WOULD THE BLACK WORKERS EXPERIENCE THE HARDSHIPS OF UNEMPLOYMENT
POD0000004493_S0000027 IT MEANS THERE ARE FEWER PEOPLE EARNING THE MONEY TO BUY THE GOODS THAT WERE MADE BY THOSE BUSINESSES IN THE FIRST PLACE WHICH AGAIN EVENTUALLY COULD LEAD TO AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN
POD0000004493_S0000032 MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST HOPE DEMANDING A DICTATOR TO TAKE OVER THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT SADIE ALEXANDER WAS NOT A SOCIALIST SHE BELIEVED IN REGULATED CAPITALISM SAYS NINA BANKS
POD0000004493_S0000038 IN FACT A NATIONAL JOBS GUARANTEE IS A POLICY IDEA THAT IS BEING HOTLY DEBATED RIGHT NOW SOMETHING ELSE THAT ECONOMISTS ARE DEBATING RIGHT NOW IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE ECONOMY IS IN FACT AT FULL EMPLOYMENT
POD0000004493_S0000047 THE NUMBERS FOR BLACK MEN EARNING PH DS AND FOR BLACK UNDERGRADUATE ECONOMICS DEGREES ARE ONLY SLIGHTLY BETTER
POD0000004501_S0000003 BUT THE BUDGET FROM CONGRESS DID NOT INCLUDE THE FUNDING TRUMP WANTED FOR HIS WALL
POD0000004501_S0000008 AND
POD0000004501_S0000014 AND IT BASICALLY ALLOWS THE PRESIDENT TO TAP INTO A BUNCH OF ADDITIONAL POWERS IN THE CASE OF A NATIONAL EMERGENCY THIS IS THE INDICATOR FROM PLANET MONEY I'M STACEY VANEK SMITH
POD0000004501_S0000029 AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LAW GAVE CONGRESS THE ABILITY TO TERMINATE A STATE OF EMERGENCY
POD0000004501_S0000041 THIS HAS BEEN USED TO LEVY SANCTIONS AGAINST FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS OR FOREIGN OFFICIALS OR FOREIGN ACTORS
POD0000004501_S0000046 WE'RE NOT REALLY UNDER ANY THREAT THERE'S NOT REALLY AN EMERGENCY
POD0000004501_S0000065 AND WE WILL HAVE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY
POD0000004509_S0000004 LIKE TEN YEARS AGO DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS I TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT THEN
POD0000004509_S0000024 YOU CAN'T JUST SHOVE THE DOLLAR IN THE ARCADE MACHINE YOU NEED QUARTERS SO SUDDENLY THE VALUE OF QUARTERS BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT LIKE IF YOU DON'T HAVE LIKE YOUR DOLLAR'S USELESS YOU CAN SIT THERE WITH YOUR DOLLAR ALL DAY IT'S NOT GOING TO GET YOU ANYWHERE
POD0000004509_S0000040 WHEN YOU SEE MECHANICAL PROBLEMS IN THE REPO MARKET
POD0000004517_S0000019 WHICH MEANT MORE COMPANIES STARTED MAKING SOLAR PANELS AND THEN COMPANIES THAT MADE SOLAR PANELS STARTED COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER TO MAKE CHEAPER MORE EFFICIENT PANELS
POD0000004517_S0000035 JUST SPANNING TEN CITY BLOCKS JUST LAID OUT BEFORE US ALL THESE BUILDINGS LIKE AS FAR AS WE CAN ALL OF THESE BUILDINGS AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE LIKE HOW MANY SQUARE FEET OF ROOF TWENTY-TWO ACRES I'D HAVE TO DO THE MATH ON THE SQUARE FEET ON THAT WE DID THE MATH OH WE DID THE MATH AND IT IS ALMOST A MILLION SQUARE FEET OF ROOF
POD0000004525_S0000015 TODAY'S INDICATOR IS NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION
POD0000004525_S0000022 LIKE FRIENDS AND THE OFFICE TO THESE OTHER NEW STREAMING SERVICES
POD0000004525_S0000041 NOT ONLY WILL DISNEY HAVE ALL THE YOU KNOW DISNEY MOVIES IT'LL HAVE ALL THE MARVEL COMICS STUFF AND ALL THE PIXAR STUFF AND ALL THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC STUFF AND STAR WARS
POD0000004525_S0000055 AND YOU'LL GET A DEAL IF YOU SIGN A THREE-YEAR CONTRACT
POD0000004533_S0000018 ALSO A LOT OF JOBS ARE GOING AWAY ENTIRELY SO HE SAYS I SHOULD BE EXCITED ABOUT WORKING FROM HOME
POD0000004533_S0000025 SO FOR ME THE OFFICE WAS PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS AN IMPOSITION AND I CAN TOTALLY SEE THAT IF YOU ARE WORKING FROM HOME FOR A FEW DAYS GETTING IN THE ZONE IS MUCH EASIER AT HOME THAN IT IS IN AN OFFICE FULL OF RADIO JOURNALISTS WHO ARE ALL CHATTY AND NOSY AND GREGARIOUS AND HAVE BOOMY RADIO VOICES
POD0000004533_S0000031 IS THAT THE LEVEL OF TRUST YOU HAVE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO WORK AT YOUR COMPANY WORK WITH YOU
POD0000004533_S0000037 I GIVE THEM FOOD
POD0000004533_S0000044 AND SOME OF MY FAVORITE MOMENTS AT WORK IN LIFE EVEN ARE WHEN WE'RE ALL STANDING AROUND TALKING AND JOKING
POD0000004533_S0000062 DIAL INTO A MORNING MEETING WITH THE TEAM I SEND LOTS OF EMAILS AND TEXTS AND WRITE NEWS STORIES
POD0000004541_S0000016 YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN YOUR DECISION AND YOUR STRATEGY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
POD0000004541_S0000030 YOU KNOW A LONG CAREER COMES WITH PROS AND CONS BUT AS A WHOLE
POD0000004541_S0000052 NOW HE MAY HAVE A HARDER TIME DOING THAT WITH THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT OBVIOUSLY IT'S ALSO HARD TO SAY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY POLLING ABOUT HOW VOTERS FEEL ABOUT PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO TAKE OUT SOLEIMANI
POD0000004549_S0000017 SO THEY GOT THOUGH INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE
POD0000004549_S0000030 HAS BASICALLY SAID
POD0000004549_S0000049 TELLS YOU THAT DEMOCRATS ARE VERY INVESTED AND ENERGIZED ABOUT THIS FIELD
POD0000004549_S0000062 PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO LAST FOR VERY LONG IF THEY DON'T DO WELL IN THOSE DEBATES GAIN MORE ATTENTION AND RAISE MORE MONEY AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A GROUP CALLED EMILY'S LIST WHICH SUPPORTS FEMALE PRO-CHOICE CANDIDATES AND EMILY STANDS FOR EARLY MONEY IS LIKE YEAST AND THAT'S WHAT DOMENICO'S TALKING ABOUT
POD0000004549_S0000077 IT SPENT ABOUT FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS
POD0000004549_S0000092 WHY DO DEMOCRATS WANT TO FIGHT WITH ONE HAND TIED BEHIND THEIR BACK WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT ONLY FIGHTING WITH BOTH HANDS BUT BRASS KNUCKLES AND WHATEVER OTHER TOOL IS AT HIS DISPOSAL BECAUSE HE'S WILLING TO TAKE IT ALL RIGHT WOULD YOU RATHER BE PURE OR WOULD YOU RATHER WIN
POD0000004557_S0000019 BUT YOU COULD DO SIT-DOWN RESTAURANTS MOVIE THEATERS THINGS LIKE THAT COULD OPEN UP
POD0000004557_S0000027 BUT HERE IS A BIG CHALLENGE
POD0000004557_S0000046 YOU KNOW WHAT RIGHT NOW STATES ARE SCRAMBLING WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS THEY'RE TRYING TO HIRE PEOPLE FORM PARTNERSHIPS TO DO THIS CONTACT TRACING THAT WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT AND THIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL TO PREVENTING A SECOND OR THIRD WAVE
POD0000004557_S0000054 WE'RE YOU KNOW THERE'S GLIMMERS OF HOPE HERE AND WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT WE ARE JUST NOT SET UP RIGHT NOW TO MOVE TO THIS NEXT PHASE SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A BIG CONCERN AROUND A TIMELINE
POD0000004557_S0000067 AND WE'RE BACK AND WE'RE JOINED NOW BY AN ENTIRELY NEW CAST DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN HEY THERE HELLO AND SUSAN DAVIS HOW ARE YOU
POD0000004557_S0000078 BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF A DECISIVE FACTOR WAS IT
POD0000004557_S0000095 PUT A GIANT CRACK IN THE GLASS CEILING
POD0000004557_S0000108 I MEAN
POD0000004557_S0000118 IT APPLIES TO MEN TOO GENDER IS STILL A FACTOR IN THIS RACE WITH BIDEN AND TRUMP IN THIS I MEAN THEY ARE BOTH GUYS THAT LIKE TO COME OFF AS TOUGH
POD0000004557_S0000139 SO HOW ABOUT YOU SUE
POD0000004557_S0000159 NOW SHE WAS LIKE TORN APART ON SOME CORNERS OF THE ONLINE WORLD SOME PEOPLE MOCKED HER AS BEING NANCY ANTOINETTE BECAUSE APPARENTLY SOME OF THE ICE CREAM THAT SHE HAD WAS VERY LIKE HIGH-END EXPENSIVE ICE CREAM
POD0000004557_S0000173 HE COMPLETED HIS CHALLENGE THIS MORNING LIVE ON BBC BREAKFAST TV AND AS I RECORD THIS HE'S MANAGED TO RAISE TWELVE POINT SEVEN MILLION POUNDS
POD0000004565_S0000009 SO PETE BUTTIGIEG IS QUITE A BIT YOUNGER THAN MOST ALL OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE FIELD MOST NOTABLY THE OTHER LEADING DEMOCRATS IN THIS RACE WHO ARE ALL IN THEIR SEVENTY S
POD0000004565_S0000029 I CONTACTED OVER HALF A DOZEN OLD DEMOCRATIC RENAISSANCE PROJECT MEMBERS MOST DECLINED TO TALK ON TAPE FOR THIS STORY THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS CAMPAIGN POLITICS GIVEN THEIR PROFESSIONAL TIES
POD0000004565_S0000038 TODAY SOME ARE MORE CENTRIST OTHERS MORE LIBERAL
POD0000004565_S0000054 IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PROGRESSIVISM RIGHT THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT AND SEARCHING FOR I WILL SAY SOME PEOPLE WHO KNOW HIM FROM THIS TIME PERIOD VERY STRONGLY STILL FEEL LIKE HE IS SO MUCH MORE PROGRESSIVE THAN WHERE THE PARTY WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR
POD0000004573_S0000023 WELL THEY WERE DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN HIM SO THIS THERE WERE ABOUT A LITTLE OVER SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE AT THIS EVENT IN UTAH THIS IS ONE OF THE SUPER TUESDAY STATES
POD0000004573_S0000032 AND HE WILL BUILD ON HIS PERFORMANCE AT THE NEXT DEBATE SO THEY KNOW HE HAS TO DO BETTER AND IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT FOR SOME CANDIDATES WHO DON'T HAVE RESOURCES
POD0000004573_S0000047 BUT YES THE SENTENCING RECOMMENDATION FROM THE PROSECUTION HAS BEEN
POD0000004573_S0000062 AND SHE WOULD RULE ON HIS MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL IN THE DAYS PERHAPS WEEKS TO COME
POD0000004573_S0000072 TODAY HE TWEETED SAYING THEY SAY ROGER STONE LIED TO CONGRESS OH I SEE BUT SO DID COMEY AND HE ALSO LEAKED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION FOR WHICH ALMOST EVERYONE
POD0000004573_S0000083 AND WE'LL BE BACK TOMORROW WITH OUR WEEKLY ROUNDUP UNTIL THEN HEAD TO NPR DOT ORG SLASH POLITICSNEWSLETTER TO SUBSCRIBE TO A WEEKLY ROUNDUP OF OUR BEST ONLINE ANALYSIS
POD0000004581_S0000020 BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT INVESTIGATIONS THEY'RE SAYING LET'S TURN OVER EVERY ROCK LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE COMES UP
POD0000004581_S0000036 AND WE HAVE BARR SAYING YESTERDAY THAT HE DOESN'T MIND IF MUELLER TESTIFIES
POD0000004581_S0000046 WE HEARD A NUMBER OF STORIES REPORTING OUT THE DYSFUNCTION IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE EFFORTS THAT THE PRESIDENT MADE IN ORDER TO DISRUPT INVESTIGATIONS INTO HIS PAST BEHAVIOR
POD0000004581_S0000103 A BLACK BANDEAU TOP MAYBE
POD0000004581_S0000127 ALL RIGHT
POD0000004589_S0000005 THIS PODCAST WAS ORIGINALLY RECORDED AT
POD0000004589_S0000012 TO GET A CLEARER PICTURE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND THERE
POD0000004589_S0000023 AROUND FOUR HOURS LATER
POD0000004589_S0000031 IT'S JUST MORE OF A LOGISTICAL HEADACHE THERE AND AS YOU SAY PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE PEOPLE ARE VOTING PEOPLE ARE WORKING AS POLL WORKERS
POD0000004589_S0000043 BUT IF IT WASN'T THEY WERE GOING TO BE THERE
POD0000004589_S0000055 AND THE MAJORITY OF THE CASES IN MILWAUKEE HAVE COME FROM AFRICAN AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS
POD0000004589_S0000062 BUT LET'S NARROW IN ON WHO THEY'RE VOTING FOR
POD0000004589_S0000070 SO IN OTHER WORDS SANDERS TO TURN THIS AIRCRAFT CARRIER AROUND
POD0000004597_S0000010 FIGHT HARD
POD0000004597_S0000027 SO HERE'S HOW I THINK ABOUT THIS
POD0000004597_S0000033 I WANT TO SEE US CUT THE NUMBER OF DEATHS BY EIGHTY PERCENT
POD0000004597_S0000040 BUT WE MADE THAT COMMITMENT
POD0000004597_S0000049 THE POINT IS ON GUN SAFETY THERE'S A LOT WE COULD DO WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE LAW
POD0000004597_S0000054 WHY DOESN'T IT HAPPEN
POD0000004597_S0000064 IT'S TO STAY AFTER MITCH MCCONNELL BRING IT TO A VOTE
POD0000004597_S0000070 YOU RECENTLY SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS MORE THAN A RACIST
POD0000004597_S0000076 COME ON
POD0000004597_S0000084 AND WHAT HAPPENS
POD0000004597_S0000091 AND YOU HAVE CRITICIZED DONALD TRUMP ON TRADE MOST RECENTLY SAYING THAT HE HAS A TARIFF-BY-TWEET STRATEGY
POD0000004597_S0000098 HE HAS NO TRADE POLICY
POD0000004597_S0000104 I WANT THE UNIONS AT THE TABLE I WANT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AT THE TABLE I WANT SMALL FARMERS THE INDEPENDENT FARMERS RIGHT HERE IN IOWA
POD0000004597_S0000111 BECAUSE WHEN WE TRY TO COMPETE AGAINST COUNTRIES THAT HAVEN'T RAISED THOSE STANDARDS
POD0000004597_S0000125 SO A BIG PART OF MY PLAN MY FARM PLAN STARTS WITH HEALTH CARE
POD0000004597_S0000135 THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION WAS REALLY RELAXED SENATOR WARREN PUT HER FOOT UP ON THE CHAIR AND HER HAND ON HER KNEE AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW HER LIFE HAS AFFECTED HER POLITICS
POD0000004597_S0000140 WHEN WE LOST THE FAMILY STATION WAGON WHEN MY MOTHER USED TO CRY EVERY NIGHT
POD0000004597_S0000148 AND MORE IMPORTANTLY
POD0000004597_S0000155 A FULL-TIME MINIMUM WAGE JOB IN AMERICA WILL NOT KEEP A MAMA AND A BABY OUT OF POVERTY
POD0000004597_S0000163 I READ THE BIBLE
POD0000004597_S0000168 AND NOT TO SIT BACK AND REFLECT ON IT
POD0000004597_S0000173 IT'S ABOUT GETTING UP AND DOING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SENATOR THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK THIS ELECTION CYCLE ABOUT RACE AND RACIAL STRIFE IN THE COUNTRY
POD0000004597_S0000183 TO BE A GOOD PARTNER GOING FORWARD
POD0000004597_S0000189 TO BORROW MORE MONEY WHILE THEY'RE IN SCHOOL AND TO HAVE A HARDER TIME PAYING IT WHEN THEY GET OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE
POD0000004597_S0000195 IT'S MORE THAN JUST UNIVERSAL COLLEGE
POD0000004597_S0000202 WITH THE REMINDER OF THE SHOOTINGS THAT HAPPEN EVERY DAY
POD0000004597_S0000207 WHO STOOD UP AND SAID I'M IN THIS FIGHT
POD0000004597_S0000214 SHE HAS THIS ICONIC LOOK
POD0000004597_S0000226 CHECK OUT OUR PODCAST FEED FOR MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH CANDIDATES LIKE KAMALA HARRIS PETE BUTTIGIEG AND BERNIE SANDERS
POD0000004605_S0000020 AND HE WASN'T DENYING IT BUT HE WAS SAYING
POD0000004605_S0000036 AND HE DID SEEM TO SAY SPECIFICALLY OR HE SAID
POD0000004605_S0000046 FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT DOES NOT SHIFT IT BUT HAVING THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE RECORD ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS AND ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT IN REFERENCE TO THE AID
POD0000004605_S0000055 AS WELL AS THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY RICK PERRY
POD0000004605_S0000070 AND HE AND MULVANEY WAS PRESSED ON THIS IDEA OF
POD0000004613_S0000011 I HAVE A SHORT OPENING STATEMENT SO LET'S START WITH THIS THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WE'VE SPENT A TON OF TIME TALKING ABOUT ON THE PODCAST UNLIKE A MR AMBASSADOR GORDON SONDLAND
POD0000004613_S0000018 AND HOLMES OVERHEARD A CONVERSATION BETWEEN SONDLAND AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT HE HEARS THE PRESIDENT ASK DIRECTLY ABOUT THE STATUS OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS THAT HE WAS SEEKING YEAH HE CLARIFIED WHETHER HE WAS IN UKRAINE OR NOT
POD0000004613_S0000035 TALKING ABOUT RUDY GIULIANI THROWING A HAND GRENADE INTO EVERYTHING AND HE THEN IN THE COURSE OF THAT DISCUSSION SAID THAT RUDY GIULIANI WAS A HAND GRENADE THAT WAS GOING TO BLOW EVERYONE UP DID YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT
POD0000004613_S0000046 AND THOSE TWO THINGS HAD JUST DIVERGED
POD0000004613_S0000057 WELL YOU SAW THE RANKING MEMBER DEVIN NUNES ON THE COMMITTEE ENGAGE IN THIS EXCHANGE WITH HER
POD0000004613_S0000073 ZELENSKIY HASN'T COMPLAINED ABOUT PRESSURE THE UKRAINIANS SAY THAT EVERYTHING'S FINE THERE'S BEEN NO PROBLEM HERE
POD0000004613_S0000080 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT ARE WE DONE WITH PUBLIC HEARINGS AT LEAST IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SO I TALKED TO JOAQUIN CASTRO HE'S A DEMOCRAT ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ABOUT THIS TODAY THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO ONE REALLY KNOWS
POD0000004621_S0000015 AND I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF CALLING THE REPUBLICAN BLUFF REPUBLICANS IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR WEEKS HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS IS NOT A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION THE HOUSE HAS NOT VOTED TO AUTHORIZE THIS
POD0000004621_S0000022 THIS IS NOT A LEGITIMATE INQUIRY
POD0000004621_S0000028 IT'S A GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE DEMOCRATS WILL ALSO SAY THIS IS A RESOLUTION THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO EITHER
POD0000004621_S0000034 DEMOCRATS SENDING A MESSAGE
POD0000004621_S0000042 AND THE TOUGHER REALITY FOR DEMOCRATS IS EVEN IF THEY'RE COMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW
POD0000004621_S0000052 NAMELY THAT THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT'S ALLIES TOOK STEPS TO WITHHOLD MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE IN ORDER TO PRESSURE THE COUNTRY TO INVESTIGATE POLITICAL RIVALS INCLUDING JOE BIDEN
POD0000004621_S0000065 YOU KNOW THE TRANSCRIPT IS OUT THERE AND EVERYONE CAN DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES IF THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS DOING OR NOT SO SUE HOW HAVE REPUBLICANS OVER ON CAPITOL HILL BEEN REACTING TO THE TESTIMONY
POD0000004621_S0000072 EVEN IF YOU ASK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC FROM POLL EVEN IF YOU ASK SCHOLARS NOTHING IN THAT PHONE CALL IS IMPEACHABLE SO YOU CAN HEAR SOME OF THE TOP LINE ARGUMENTS THAT I THINK YOU SHOULD GET READY TO HEAR REPUBLICANS MAKE MORE AND MORE
POD0000004629_S0000020 ONE QUESTION ABOUT THIS WEEK IS
POD0000004629_S0000027 THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT THEY WENT INTO THIS WITH A LOT OF TREPIDATION THEY FELT THEY HAD TO DO THIS ESPECIALLY THE HOUSE
POD0000004629_S0000039 AND ACCORDING TO HIS RECOLLECTION
POD0000004629_S0000049 WILL HE BE A HELPFUL WITNESS FOR THE PRESIDENT FOR THE DEMOCRATS OR WILL HE JUST BE UNRELIABLE AND THEN THERE'S THE OTHER QUESTION OF WHO'S GOING TO THROW WHO UNDER THE BUS DONALD TRUMP IN OCTOBER SAID THAT GORDON SONDLAND WAS A GREAT GUY AND A GREAT AMERICAN IN NOVEMBER HE SAID
POD0000004629_S0000063 YOU LOOK LIKE SOMEONE WHO WASN'T PREPARED TO SAY HOW THEY WERE
POD0000004629_S0000075 LAST DEBATE HE WAS THE ONE THROWING RHETORICAL PUNCHES AT ELIZABETH WARREN
POD0000004629_S0000085 AND I THINK THE THIRD THING THOUGH I THINK IT WOULD BE TRICKY TO MAKE THAT POINT ON THE DEBATE STAGE
POD0000004629_S0000093 BUTTIGIEG IS SOMEBODY WHO HIGHLIGHTED AT THE LAST DEBATE THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN TO PAY FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL WELL THEN SHE CAME OUT WITH A PLAN
POD0000004629_S0000104 AND ALSO PART OF HER BRAND IS AS SHE WOULD SAY
POD0000004637_S0000019 WE ARE ALSO USING PHOTOS OF RESULTS AND A PAPER TRAIL TO VALIDATE THAT ALL RESULTS MATCH AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE AND ACCURACY IN THE NUMBERS WE REPORT THEY ALSO SAY
POD0000004637_S0000039 THERE COULD BE A WHOLE LOT OF UNOFFICIAL INFORMATION COMING OUT YEAH
POD0000004637_S0000047 BUT THIS IS A TERRIBLE SITUATION REFLECTS REALLY POORLY ON THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY
POD0000004637_S0000064 WHO HAS LARGELY SET LOW EXPECTATIONS HERE IN IOWA
POD0000004637_S0000079 YOU KNOW
POD0000004645_S0000006 MAN SHE SHE HAD SOME THINGS TO SAY TODAY AND BEFORE WE GET TO WHAT SHE ACTUALLY SAID
POD0000004645_S0000016 THAT SENATOR WHOSE NAME I'VE FORGOTTEN IS NOW HIMSELF DEAD
POD0000004645_S0000027 AND SHE DIDN'T MUCH CARE FOR THAT IDEA SHE THOUGHT IT WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'VE BEEN SEVERAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE WHO'VE AT LEAST BEEN OPEN TO THE IDEA OF PUTTING MORE JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COURT TO SORT OF DILUTE THE POWER OF THE NUMBER OF JUSTICES THAT ARE THERE NOW NOW THERE ARE NINE JUSTICES ON THE COURT
POD0000004645_S0000036 I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE WHO WOULD LIKE TO
POD0000004645_S0000041 AND THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE SIX APPOINTMENTS TO MAKE YOU
POD0000004645_S0000048 A TEMPORARY SITUATION
POD0000004645_S0000054 TO ENFORCE WHAT YOU SAY
POD0000004645_S0000061 WHEN THE COURT SAYS SOMETHING PEOPLE ACCEPT IT
POD0000004645_S0000067 RENDERED ITS DECISION THERE WERE NO RIOTS IN THE STREETS
POD0000004645_S0000078 CORE BELIEF
POD0000004645_S0000084 IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THERE HAVE BEEN A BUNCH OF LAWS THAT
POD0000004645_S0000094 I NEVER HAD A WOMAN TEACHER IN COLLEGE OR IN LAW SCHOOL
POD0000004645_S0000101 AND I ASKED HER HOW SHE DID THAT AND HOW IT WAS DIFFERENT MY FIRST TWO CANCER BOUTS
POD0000004645_S0000106 SOMEONE WAS THERE WHO REALLY CARED ABOUT ME AND WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THINGS DIDN'T GO WRONG
POD0000004645_S0000116 YES
POD0000004653_S0000011 THE REPUBLICANS CAME IN WITH A SIMPLE FOCUSED GOAL TO UNDERMINE COHEN'S CREDIBILITY AND WHAT STRUCK ME WAS THAT WAS HARD TO DO BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY ADMITTED THAT HE LIED
POD0000004653_S0000027 HE IS A RACIST
POD0000004653_S0000037 AND I WILL LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY ACTIONS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE THE THING ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN IS HE WANTS TO BE THE SAD FAMILY GUY WHO'S REALLY SCREWED THINGS UP AND WAS JUST MAKING A BIG MISTAKE AND BELIEVED A CON MAN AND ALL OF THAT
POD0000004653_S0000054 IN THE OFFICE WITH ME WAS ALLEN WEISSELBERG THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION
POD0000004653_S0000067 ALLEN WEISSELBERG
POD0000004653_S0000075 WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT
POD0000004653_S0000087 QUOTE MR TRUMP DID NOT DIRECTLY TELL ME TO LIE TO CONGRESS THAT'S NOT HOW HE OPERATES
POD0000004653_S0000093 THE ANSWER IS NO SO YOU SAY YEAH IT'S THE NICEST LOOKING TIE I'VE EVER SEEN
POD0000004653_S0000101 AND COHEN UNDERSTOOD THAT TO MEAN OK
POD0000004653_S0000108 IN HIS WAY
POD0000004653_S0000124 HE'S A FELON HE'S GOING TO JAIL
POD0000004653_S0000136 AND NOT ONE QUESTION SO FAR HAS BEEN ASKED ABOUT MR TRUMP SO SECOND THING
POD0000004653_S0000148 I THINK THEIR GOAL WAS TO ESTABLISH THAT THE PRESIDENT BROKE THE LAW IN SOME WAYS
POD0000004653_S0000161 AND HE DIRECTED ESSENTIALLY PUT AN X ON THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION SAYING WHERE YOU CAN FIND THEM AND WHO YOU CAN TALK TO TO GET THEM
POD0000004661_S0000019 I AM IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE WHITE HOUSE WE ARE PLANNING THIS STRATEGY TOGETHER
POD0000004661_S0000028 AND THIS LEAVES A LITTLE CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY NOT A HUGE CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY BUT A LITTLE CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY HANGING OVER IT AND MAY MEAN THAT HE DOESN'T GET HIS
POD0000004661_S0000040 HE HAS EVERY REASON TO SEE THIS IN TERMS THAT COULD WORK IN HIS FAVOR COME NOVEMBER HE ALSO HAS REASON TO RIGHT IF YOU STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE POLLS
POD0000004661_S0000054 SHE CALLS ME UP
POD0000004661_S0000062 WELL SHE'D BE AGAINST IMPEACHMENT BUT NO SHE VOTED FOR IMPEACHMENT THE PRESIDENT THINKS EVERYTHING IS TRANSACTIONAL YOU KNOW YOU DO SOMEONE A PERSONAL FAVOR EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T DO THE FAVOR
POD0000004661_S0000073 THAT COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS AS WELL BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP UNLEASHED IS DONALD TRUMP TO SOME DEGREE IMPERILED WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND WHEN WE GET BACK
POD0000004661_S0000079 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOW BEEN IMPEACHED
POD0000004661_S0000088 THAT THEY REACHED A BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT TO GIVE TWELVE WEEKS OF PAID FEDERAL LEAVE TO MILLIONS OF FEDERAL WORKERS
POD0000004661_S0000105 CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT IS GOING TO BE QUITE THE WEEK AND ALSO BY THE WAY AWKWARD AND THEN THAT FRIDAY I THINK IT'S THAT FRIDAY THERE'S ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC DEBATE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IT IS THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO KILL THE PODCAST
POD0000004661_S0000113 CHRISTIANITY TODAY IN MY HOME WAS THE LIVING BREATHING EMBODIMENT OF BILLY GRAHAM BECAUSE HE FOUNDED IT
POD0000004661_S0000120 THAT IS NOT ONLY A VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION
POD0000004661_S0000127 HE HAS TWEETED ABOUT IT AT LEAST THREE TIMES ALREADY TODAY
POD0000004661_S0000132 WHICH HAPPENED AROUND WEDNESDAY EVENING WHEN I WAS HOURS INTO SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE IMPEACHMENT VOTE ON THE HOUSE FLOOR WHEN THE EMBARGO WAS LIFTED ON CATS REVIEWS YES
POD0000004661_S0000144 I HAD BEEN PROCESSING THIS MOVIE FOR THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AS TERRIFYING AND VISCERAL A TRAIN WRECK AS CATS
POD0000004661_S0000165 A REMINDER THAT THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THE PODCAST IS TO SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL NPR MEMBER STATION AND THAT'S TRUE EVEN IF YOU LISTEN ON SPOTIFY
POD0000004669_S0000017 BUT ON THE GROUND
POD0000004669_S0000028 OR AS SHE PUT IT
POD0000004669_S0000036 LOOKING AT THAT PHOTO NOW THOUGH
POD0000004669_S0000048 MOST CONNECTED MEN IN TOWN THAT HER LIFE BEGAN TO TURN TOWARDS POLITICS
POD0000004669_S0000060 SO HE SELDOM LEFT WASHINGTON
POD0000004669_S0000074 SHE RAN FOR OFFICE WITH A SIMPLE MESSAGE EVEN IN HER EARLY CAMPAIGN MATERIALS WHEN SHE WAS RUNNING FOR THE HOUSE THE VERY FIRST ONE WHEN SHE FILLED CLYDE'S SEAT
POD0000004669_S0000093 BUT THEN SHE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN THERE
POD0000004669_S0000105 SITS DOWN WITH HER ASSISTANT BILL LEWIS
POD0000004669_S0000117 SHE WAS ALWAYS MOST PROUD OF HAVING SPOKEN TRUTH TO POWER
POD0000004669_S0000132 SHE'S GOT TO BE A LITTLE LESS MOUTHY A LITTLE LESS LIBERAL
POD0000004669_S0000146 SHE ALSO IS VERY AWARE THAT SHE COULD BREAK THE BARRIER FOR WOMEN
POD0000004669_S0000178 BOMBING THE RUSSIANS
POD0000004669_S0000188 BUT IN OUR EYES TODAY IT'S GHASTLY TO TALK ABOUT HER YOU KNOW MAKING POLICY IN PIN CURLS
POD0000004669_S0000203 HOPING THAT ONCE WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER
POD0000004669_S0000211 BUT SHE DOES STEP UP TO HELP WHEN PEOPLE ASK AND THAT WAS ALWAYS THE WAY SHE DESCRIBED EVERYTHING
POD0000004669_S0000247 JUST ABOUT FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE PETITIONS WERE TO BE CIRCULATED IN THE COMMUNITY TO RUN ME FOR THE NEW YORK STATE LEGISLATURE
POD0000004669_S0000265 A SEAT WAS GOING TO BE CREATED THAT WILL GIVE THE PRIMARILY BLACK AND PUERTO RICAN PEOPLE OF THAT AREA THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR OWN VOICE IN WASHINGTON D C AND AGAIN I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SAID
POD0000004669_S0000271 I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION
POD0000004669_S0000298 ALIENATED THE MOST ACTIVE AND THE MOST CONSISTENT VOTING BLOC IN THE DISTRICT
POD0000004669_S0000309 AND SHE'S A NEW REPRESENTATIVE AND SHE DOESN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE BUT SHE GOES DOWN TO THE LITTLE LUNCH ROOM THAT THEY HAVE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CHAMBER AND I ORDERED MY LUNCH I WAS VERY HUNGRY THAT DAY
POD0000004669_S0000333 I AM GOING TO HELP YOU
POD0000004669_S0000352 ALTHOUGH I AM A WOMAN
POD0000004669_S0000377 MY GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT
POD0000004669_S0000382 I REALLY DON'T
POD0000004669_S0000402 HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SHOWED UP IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY SCHROEDER SPEAKS FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE DROPPING THE NEWS EVERYONE CAME FOR TAKING OUR DENVER FORM OF OPEN POLITICS ON THE ROAD THIS SUMMER
POD0000004669_S0000416 OF COURSE IT WASN'T A NEWS CONFERENCE LIKE ANY OTHER BECAUSE THAT MOMENT BECAME THE STORY
POD0000004669_S0000431 SHE GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN DES MOINES IOWA
POD0000004669_S0000450 THE QUESTION GARY HART WAS A POLITICAL STAR
POD0000004669_S0000470 WHICH WAS NOT THE MOST THOUGHT-THROUGH THOUGHTFUL RESPONSE
POD0000004669_S0000475 AND THAT'S KEY HERE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A SYMBOLIC CANDIDATE SHE WANTED TO GET THAT NOMINATION
POD0000004669_S0000490 THAT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE SAID THEY WOULD NEVER VOTE FOR A WOMAN
POD0000004669_S0000496 OTHER QUESTIONS LIKE WILL MY HUSBAND HAVE TO PUT HIS TUXEDO IN THE SMITHSONIAN
POD0000004669_S0000514 MEN HAVE A BASIC UNIFORM BUT WOMEN EITHER LOOK LIKE A VOGUE MODEL OR THEY LOOK LIKE AN UNMADE BED
POD0000004669_S0000520 IN THE SENSE OF
POD0000004669_S0000539 AS FOR HOW VOTERS FELT ABOUT ELECTING A WOMAN IT DIDN'T LOOK GREAT
POD0000004669_S0000548 PEOPLE SPECULATED WHETHER SCHROEDER WOULD OFFICIALLY DECLARE HERSELF A CANDIDATE
POD0000004669_S0000566 WE'VE LARGELY GOTTEN PAST MAINSTREAM JOURNALISTS TALKING ABOUT WHETHER WOMEN CANDIDATES ARE GOOD-LOOKING OR HAVE VOICES THAT ARE TOO HIGH-PITCHED
POD0000004669_S0000572 WOULD THE PEOPLE IN THE NEXT STATE OR ACROSS THE COUNTRY
POD0000004677_S0000017 DEMOCRATS ARE USING THE WORD BRIBERY A LOT MORE DEMOCRATS ARE USUALLY LATE TO THE BRANDING GAME DONALD TRUMP IS ALWAYS FIRST THIS IS HIS SPECIALITY SO TO SPEAK
POD0000004677_S0000030 AND IT WAS PART OF THE BUDGET THAT WAS FINALLY APPROVED LAST WINTER
POD0000004677_S0000038 THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND
POD0000004677_S0000049 THERE ARE NO ALLEGATIONS THAT HER FIRING WAS ILLEGAL OR IMPEACHABLE THE PRESIDENT CAN FIRE ANY DIPLOMAT HE WANTS FOR NO REASON AT ALL
POD0000004677_S0000058 I BECAME ALARMED AS THOSE EFFORTS BORE FRUIT
POD0000004677_S0000070 SHE CAN DESCRIBE THE SHADOW FOREIGN POLICY THAT WAS BEING CONDUCTED
POD0000004677_S0000076 WE'LL BE BACK TOMORROW UNTIL THEN HEAD TO NPR DOT ORG SLASH POLITICSNEWSLETTER TO SUBSCRIBE TO A WEEKLY ROUNDUP OF OUR BEST ONLINE ANALYSIS
POD0000004685_S0000010 ESSENTIALLY ECHOING A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN MAKING TODAY ABOUT WHY THEY SHOULDN'T IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP THEY USED SOME OF THAT TAPE EARLIER IN THE WEEK AND THERE WAS ONE CLIP IN PARTICULAR OF A VERY MUCH YOUNGER CHUCK SCHUMER THAT HE APPARENTLY FOUND VERY FUNNY BECAUSE AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO HIS STAFF AND STARTED LAUGHING WELL AND AFTER THIS DAILY SHOW-STYLE SUPER CUT
POD0000004685_S0000022 YOU CAN'T DO THAT
POD0000004685_S0000029 AND AT THE MOMENT
POD0000004685_S0000039 I NEVER TOLD JOHN BOLTON THAT THE AID TO UKRAINE WAS TIED TO INVESTIGATIONS INTO DEMOCRATS INCLUDING THE BIDENS IN FACT
POD0000004685_S0000052 SO HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW
POD0000004685_S0000057 SO SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL OUTLINED THE PROCESS BEFORE THEY ADJOURNED TODAY
POD0000004685_S0000070 AND YEAH IT IS FOR THE SENATORS WHOSE VOTES ARE IN THE MIDDLE THE SUSAN COLLINSES THE MITT ROMNEYS
POD0000004693_S0000013 AND SO HE GOES ON TWITTER AND LIKENS HIM TO THE PRESIDENT OF AN ADVERSARIAL COUNTRY AND SCOTT WHAT JAY POWELL SAID IN A VERY FED CHAIRMAN
POD0000004693_S0000019 OUR GREAT AMERICAN COMPANIES ARE HEREBY ORDERED TO IMMEDIATELY START LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TO CHINA
POD0000004693_S0000036 OH YEAH YOU'RE PUTTING TARIFFS ON US WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND PUT TARIFFS ON YOU
POD0000004693_S0000042 THIS PRESIDENT INHERITED AN ECONOMY THAT WAS IN GOOD SHAPE AND STEADILY IMPROVING IT WAS STEADILY IMPROVING IN A WAY IT HAD BEEN DOING FOR YEARS
POD0000004693_S0000051 JUSTICE GINSBURG WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE PERIODIC BLOOD TESTS AND SCANS BUT THE COURT SAYS NO FURTHER TREATMENT IS NEEDED RIGHT NOW
POD0000004693_S0000063 THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF YOU KNOW MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACKING BUT IT SPEAKS TO THE FRUSTRATION THAT MEMBERS HAD THEY ALSO JUST WANTED TO KNOW SORT OF HOW SHE WAS RUNNING THIS ORGANIZATION WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS SHE WAS MAKING
POD0000004693_S0000073 IT'S A PRIVATE ORGANIZATION MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT TO SAY SHOW US YOUR BOOKS WE WANT A GOVERNANCE AUDIT BEFORE WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU
POD0000004693_S0000081 SARAH CHAMBERLAIN IS THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE REPUBLICAN MAIN STREET PARTNERSHIP
POD0000004693_S0000094 ADMITTING THAT YOU TAKE IT JUST TO REPUBLICANS AND THE INTENTION IS TO HELP THEM WIN
POD0000004693_S0000105 THE REPUBLICAN MAIN STREET PARTNERSHIP BILLS ITSELF AS THE QUOTE GOVERNING WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
POD0000004693_S0000115 AND WHEN SHE WAS EXPLAINING WHAT IT WAS IT JUST WAS RAISING KIND OF THESE QUESTIONS IN MY HEAD OF LIKE IT'S KIND OF WEIRD THAT THEY'RE NONPARTISAN AND WHY AREN'T THEY PARTISAN AND WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
POD0000004701_S0000018 I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT
POD0000004701_S0000027 WE NEED TO DO IT IN A WAY AS WHILE WE ARE MAKING IT AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT WANT THE HOPE THAT IT MIGHT WORK
POD0000004701_S0000044 TODAY THEY ARE NOW BRINGING IN DEMOCRATS SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER
POD0000004701_S0000063 WELL I THINK TO UNDERSTAND THIS STORY YOU HAVE TO GET A SENSE OF THE TIMELINE OF THE STORY RIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO GO BACK ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO TO FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVEN
POD0000004701_S0000092 THAT NAMELY THAT AROUND THE TIME THAT HE WAS AWARE OF HOW SERIOUS THE CORONAVIRUS IMPLICATIONS COULD BE
POD0000004701_S0000118 YOU KNOW
POD0000004701_S0000128 WAS THERE WINE INVOLVED
POD0000004701_S0000143 YOU GUYS DON'T NEED TO GO OUT JUST STAY HERE LIKE ME
POD0000004701_S0000158 THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING
POD0000004709_S0000016 ROBERT MUELLER DID TRY TO DEMOLISH SOME OF THE TALKING POINTS THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN PUTTING OUT THERE SINCE THE INVESTIGATION BEGAN
POD0000004709_S0000038 BUT HE WAS ASKED AND DIDN'T ANSWER WHETHER HE GOT TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS
POD0000004709_S0000047 THEY DIDN'T GO TO THE COURT THEY USED HUMAN SOURCES
POD0000004709_S0000060 AND THIS HEARING TODAY IS THEIR LAST BEST HOPE TO BUILD UP SOME SORT OF GROUNDSWELL ACROSS AMERICA TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP
POD0000004709_S0000080 A BUNCH OF DEMOCRATS CAME FORWARD FOR IMPEACHMENT WHEN THAT REPORT FIRST CAME OUT A FEW MORE SEVERAL MORE CAME FORWARD WHEN HE FIRST SPOKE PUBLICLY
POD0000004718_S0000018 SO THEY BOTH HAD A NEGATIVE REACTION TO WHAT WAS ON THE CALL WITHOUT HESITATION
POD0000004718_S0000028 WILLIAMS IS A FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT WHO'S BEEN DETAILED TO VICE PRESIDENT PENCE'S STAFF
POD0000004718_S0000036 DAD
POD0000004718_S0000044 IMPERIL AMERICAN ASSISTANCE FOR UKRAINE IN THAT FIGHT
POD0000004718_S0000055 ANY IDEA WHY THEY HAVE THOSE IMPRESSIONS COL VINDMAN
POD0000004718_S0000069 THEY BRIEFLY STARTED TO REFER TO THE PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT ON THE JULY TWENTY FIVE CALL AS EXTORTION
POD0000004718_S0000078 THE BRIBE DIDN'T GO ALL THE WAY THERE
POD0000004718_S0000089 IN RETROSPECT
POD0000004718_S0000097 HE DIDN'T GET IT HE DIDN'T GET THE SECRET CODE
POD0000004718_S0000104 HE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
POD0000004718_S0000110 BUT HE DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING THAT HE THOUGHT WAS INAPPROPRIATE OR ILLEGAL DID ANYTHING CONCERN YOU ON THE CALL
POD0000004718_S0000120 AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE WHERE WE ARE SO IN TERMS OF WHAT REPUBLICANS WERE TRYING TO GET FROM THESE WITNESSES
POD0000004718_S0000128 TRUMP SAYS I HOPE YOU CAN SEE YOUR WAY CLEAR TO LETTING THIS THING GO TO LETTING FLYNN GO WHAT IS TRUMP SAYING
POD0000004718_S0000134 EVEN THOUGH WE'RE REALLY TIRED NOW IT TURNS OUT WE GET TO GET UP EARLY TOMORROW AND DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN AND THE WITNESS TESTIFYING TOMORROW IS SOMEONE WHOSE NAME HAS BEEN UTTERED COUNTLESS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF THIS PUBLIC TESTIMONY
POD0000004726_S0000029 I'M INTERESTED IN SEEING WHEN YOU PUT THE TWO OF THEM ONSTAGE TOGETHER FIRST OF ALL WHAT DAYLIGHT DOES EMERGE BETWEEN THEM ON ANY PARTICULAR VIEWS BUT EVEN LEAVING ASIDE THE SUBSTANCE
POD0000004726_S0000036 FORMER MARYLAND REPRESENTATIVE JOHN DELANEY FORMER COLORADO GOVERNOR JOHN HICKENLOOPER
POD0000004726_S0000064 WHEN YOU TALK TO THESE CAMPAIGNS BOTH FROM BUTTIGIEG'S SIDE AS WELL AS O'ROURKE'S THERE'S A SENSE THAT THESE ARE GUYS WHO DON'T LIKE TO NECESSARILY THROW PUNCHES
POD0000004726_S0000074 NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO NEW JERSEY SENATOR CORY BOOKER ENTREPRENEUR ANDREW YANG
POD0000004726_S0000081 BIG OVERARCHING HEADLINE ON IT IS THAT HE IS FRAMING IT AS
POD0000004726_S0000105 YOU KNOW THEY ARE THINKING IN PRACTICAL TERMS HOW DO I GET THIS THING PASSED WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST
POD0000004734_S0000007 AND WE KNOW YOU MIGHT DISAGREE WITH US THAT'S TOTALLY OK AND WE'D LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK THE TOP POLITICAL MOMENTS OF THE LAST DECADE WERE
POD0000004734_S0000018 THERE WAS AN ENTIRE MOVEMENT OF CONSERVATIVES JUST WAITING TO HAPPEN TO REEMERGE
POD0000004734_S0000024 THEY WERE FINE WITH DEFICITS OR AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THEM AT ALL ONCE REPUBLICANS CAME BACK TO POWER AND RAN UP THE DEFICIT WAY BIGGER THAN OBAMA HAD EVER DONE CAN YOU DRAW A THROUGHLINE FROM THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT TO THE PRESIDENCY AND ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP
POD0000004734_S0000029 WAIT A MINUTE WE'RE NOT SURE WE'RE ON BOARD FOR ALL OF THIS DIVERSITY WE'RE NOT SURE WE'RE ON BOARD FOR ALL THIS SOCIAL CHANGE
POD0000004734_S0000037 AND BECAUSE HE WANTS TO HAVE A BIG SPENDING GOVERNMENT THAT HELPS HIM GET REELECTED AND BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE
POD0000004734_S0000044 IT'S THE LAST GASP OF A MOVEMENT IN AMERICA THAT WAS CONCERNED WITH OUR NATIONAL DEBT
POD0000004734_S0000050 BUT IN THIS CASE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SCHOOL
POD0000004734_S0000062 A REPUBLICAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA AND JOE MANCHIN A DEMOCRAT FROM WEST VIRGINIA
POD0000004734_S0000068 THAT COULDN'T PASS PART OF THE REASON WHY I MADE THE CASE FOR THIS BEING ONE OF THESE MOMENTS IS ONE I COVERED IT
POD0000004734_S0000076 BUT THE MOMENT IS FLEETING AND IT GOES AWAY AND IT'S A PATTERN THAT'S BEEN REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
POD0000004734_S0000086 THE RESPONSE TO NEWTOWN EXPLAINS IT THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE THIS AS A MOMENT AND WE NEED TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK BUT THE FILIBUSTER CONTINUES TO BE A PART OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT NEXT WITH TWO MORE DEFINING POLITICAL MOMENTS OF THE DECADE
POD0000004734_S0000095 I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE MOMENT
POD0000004734_S0000109 THEY'RE NOT AS LEGITIMATE BUT THESE JUDICIAL WARS TO ME ALSO SPEAK TO THIS RISE AND ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE IF NOT FOR MCCONNELL'S MERRICK GARLAND DECISION AND THIS PROMISE OF A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ON THE OTHER END OF THIS ELECTION
POD0000004734_S0000117 THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD HAPPENED ELEVEN YEARS EARLIER WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS STILL VERY MUCH IN HIS REALITY SHOW STAR PERSONA
POD0000004734_S0000138 THERE WAS A DEBATE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON IN WHICH MANY PEOPLE ANTICIPATED TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE IN SOME SENSE OR ANOTHER HUMILIATED BY ALL OF THIS
POD0000004734_S0000150 EVER MORE A SENIOR EDITOR AND CORRESPONDENT AND WE WISH YOU A HAPPY NEW YEAR
POD0000004742_S0000026 THE POLITICAL CALCULATION OR ARGUMENT BEING MADE BY THE WHITE HOUSE IS BECAUSE THERE'S PRECEDENT THAT CONTRADICTS WHAT PELOSI IS DOING
POD0000004742_S0000041 BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S ALWAYS POLITICS AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS MAKING A POLITICAL CALCULATION
POD0000004742_S0000053 REPUBLICANS WOULD MAKE THAT THE FOCUS OF ATTACKS FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS
POD0000004742_S0000064 MUCH LESS SUPPORT FOR REMOVING THE PRESIDENT FROM HIS OFFICE MONTHS BEFORE VOTERS ARE SUPPOSED TO GET TO DECIDE THAT FOR THEMSELVES
POD0000004750_S0000027 JUST TO BE CLEAR ON THIS DAY
POD0000004750_S0000044 AND HE SAYS YOU KNOW I TALKED TO SOME PEOPLE AND THEY DESCRIBED THE PROJECTS TO ME AND THEY DIDN'T SOUND TOO IMPORTANT TO ME WHAT'S FASCINATING IS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING THAT HE'S GOING TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF THE MILITARY CONSTRUCTION BUDGET AS TAM NOTED THAT COVERS MILITARY HOUSING
POD0000004750_S0000053 BUT I'D RATHER DO IT MUCH FASTER
POD0000004750_S0000066 OH YEAH
POD0000004750_S0000080 AND WE WILL POSSIBLY GET A BAD RULING
POD0000004750_S0000096 POLITICALLY HE'S GOING TO GET ONBOARD AND GET BEHIND THE PRESIDENT ONCE THE PRESIDENT DECIDES THIS IS THE PLAN FORWARD
POD0000004750_S0000111 BECAUSE CONGRESS HASN'T ACTED
POD0000004758_S0000010 SUCH AS THE PURSUIT OF PERSONAL POLITICAL ADVANTAGE
POD0000004758_S0000016 WHICH IS A REALLY ILLUMINATING ONE OFF THE TOP
POD0000004758_S0000029 HEY CAN YOU PLEASE RESPOND TO THE OTHER SIDE'S CASE AND IN THIS CASE THE REBUTTAL CAME FROM ADAM SCHIFF
POD0000004758_S0000044 IF WITNESSES ARE CALLED BY THE HOUSE MANAGERS THROUGH THAT MOTION
POD0000004758_S0000058 AND DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHETHER WE COULD SEE MORE SURPRISES AHEAD
POD0000004766_S0000007 SO
POD0000004766_S0000021 IXNAY NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN WAS THAT A SURPRISE
POD0000004766_S0000031 HAS THE RIGHT WHICH THEY HAVE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION
POD0000004766_S0000040 YOU BASICALLY HAVE ONE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT CONSIDERING THE POLITICAL DEATH PENALTY FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ONCE THAT HAPPENS
POD0000004766_S0000050 I WANT TO GO TO WHAT SPEAKER PELOSI SAID WHEN SHE CAME OUT OF THAT MEETING THAT FAMILY MEETING WITH THE DEMOCRATS
POD0000004766_S0000060 SO FROM THAT MEETING ON CAPITOL HILL
POD0000004766_S0000068 TRUMP STORMED INTO THE MEETING REALLY ANGRY
POD0000004766_S0000076 I WANT TO DO INFRASTRUCTURE
POD0000004766_S0000083 THAT IF THE DEMOCRATS INVESTIGATED HIM HE WOULD NOT WORK WITH THEM ON ANY LEGISLATION NOW WHO DOES THAT HURT MORE POLITICALLY
POD0000004766_S0000097 NOT REALLY THINKING THEY WANTED TO DO INFRASTRUCTURE OR ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN INVESTIGATE
POD0000004766_S0000105 INFRASTRUCTURE IS A BIPARTISAN INITIATIVE WITH SUPPORT FROM BOTH PARTIES
POD0000004766_S0000117 I THINK THAT HELPS THEM MAKE THE ARGUMENT THE ONE THING I WILL SAY ABOUT THAT IS THAT DEMOCRATS I TALKED TO WHO WERE ELECTED IN PREVIOUSLY REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS SOME OF THESE MORE VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS SAY THAT THEY REALLY DID NEED TO BE ABLE TO PASS SOMETHING THOUGH
POD0000004774_S0000012 RECOMMENDED SEVEN TO NINE YEARS
POD0000004774_S0000019 THE FOUR PROSECUTORS WHO WERE HANDLING THE CASE STONE'S CASE THEY WITHDRAW FROM THE CASE ONE OF THEM RESIGNS FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ENTIRELY
POD0000004774_S0000032 AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SKEPTICISM AND SUSPICION ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW AND WHAT BARR WAS SAYING
POD0000004774_S0000041 THE PRESIDENT HAS NEVER ASKED ME TO DO ANYTHING IN A CRIMINAL CASE AND HE ATTRIBUTES THAT TO AG BARR
POD0000004774_S0000050 YOU KNOW AT TRYING TO PREVENT KIND OF POLITICAL INFLUENCE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

POD0000004774_S0000090 FORTY-THREE PERCENT SUPPORT THE HOUSE CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE THE UKRAINE INCIDENT BY CALLING NEW WITNESSES SUCH AS JOHN BOLTON
POD0000004774_S0000099 WELL THEY WANT TO CONTINUE DIGGING ON HUNTER BIDEN AND HIS ROLE ON THE BOARD OF THIS COMPANY CALLED BURISMA IN UKRAINE
POD0000004774_S0000113 THOSE ATTEMPTS HAVE FAILED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
POD0000004774_S0000135 SAYS IN HIS STORY THAT HE WOULD GO TO PARTIES AND THE HOST WOULD INTRODUCE HIM AS AN NPR PERSON
POD0000004774_S0000143 YOU KNOW DATING APP BUMP EXCEPT FOR GREG TWENTY TWO

POD0000004782_S0000047 YOU KNOW
POD0000004782_S0000057 ARRESTED ON WEDNESDAY AT DULLES AIRPORT AS THEY WERE TRYING TO BOARD A ONE-WAY FLIGHT OUT OF THE COUNTRY
POD0000004782_S0000065 AND IT HAS LED TO A SITUATION WHERE A LOT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ALLIES ARE MORE MAD AT HIM THAN THEY'VE BEEN AT ANY POINT IN HIS ADMINISTRATION
POD0000004782_S0000081 ISIS FIGHTERS ATTACKING RAQQA IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS LEAVING AMERICA'S ALLIES TO BE SLAUGHTERED AND ENABLING THE RETURN OF ISIS
POD0000004782_S0000101 AYESHA WHAT ABOUT YOU

POD0000004782_S0000131 WISCONSIN ROOTS BOTH OF YOU
POD0000004782_S0000160 AND NPR DID SOMETHING THAT IT'S NEVER REALLY DONE BEFORE EXCEPT FOR A HANDFUL OF TIMES IT SAID YOU KNOW ANYONE AT NPR CAN GO TO THESE TINY DESK CONCERTS BUT THEY MADE US GET TICKETS
POD0000004790_S0000010 THAT WOULD NOT BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR EL PASO
POD0000004790_S0000022 MANY OF THE CANDIDATES SHOWED UP AT IT AND EVEN AT EVENTS THAT WERE NOT THAT FORUM
POD0000004790_S0000031 OF WINNING A SENATE SEAT IN THEIR HOME STATE IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS

POD0000004790_S0000065 WHY DOES THE STATE FAIR MATTER
POD0000004790_S0000075 AND SOMETIMES THEY JUST PLOW THROUGH THE FAIR GET THEIR CORN DOG AND GO SOMETIMES THEY DO TALK TO PEOPLE BUT IT'S NOT A GIVEN AND ASIDE FROM THAT
POD0000004790_S0000090 OK THE YIELD CURVE THE REASON THIS MATTERS IS THAT THE YIELD CURVE IS ONE OF THOSE RARE AND PRETTY GOOD PREDICTORS OF A RECESSION LIKE
POD0000004790_S0000098 I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IT JUST MEANS ALL SORTS OF UNCERTAINTY I MEAN THE BASIC THING IS THAT WHEN TRUMP SAYS THIS IS A CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE CRAZY ISN'T FAR OFF THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN OFTEN
POD0000004790_S0000117 INTEREST RATES ARE ALREADY QUITE LOW THEY'RE HALF AS HIGH AS THEY WERE BEFORE THE LAST RECESSION SO THEY HAVE LESS ROOM TO PUSH THAT ACCELERATOR DOWN ASIDE FROM THAT
POD0000004790_S0000130 I DON'T LIKE BIRDS RIGHT
POD0000004790_S0000145 I THINK WE HAVE BIGGER PREY WE WANT TO ATTACK WELL MAYBE THERE'S SOME LITTLE

POD0000004798_S0000011 HOME OF THE GEORGE H W BUSH PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM AND THE FINAL RESTING PLACE OF THE FORTY FIRST PRESIDENT HIMSELF
POD0000004798_S0000020 AND LAST YEAR EMISSIONS ROSE ONE POINT SIX PERCENT
POD0000004798_S0000038 AND THE SECOND WAS AIMED AT CUTTING DOWN ON EMISSIONS IN VEHICLES NOW THE THING IS A LOT OF THE BIG POWER COMPANIES WANT TO GET AWAY FROM COAL ANYWAY DESPITE HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKS ABOUT HOW GREAT COAL IS
POD0000004798_S0000051 BUT IT DIED IN THE SENATE
POD0000004798_S0000062 THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT ON THAT FRONT AND WE WILL DO THAT AFTER WE TAKE A QUICK BREAK
POD0000004798_S0000078 THIS IS ONE WHERE REPUBLICANS BECOME MORE SKEPTICAL DEMOCRATS BECOME MORE ALARMED ONE THEORY THAT SOCIAL SCIENTISTS HAVE ON THAT IS THAT WHILE MORE EDUCATED REPUBLICANS MAY ACTUALLY KNOW MORE ABOUT THE SCIENCE SURROUNDING CLIMATE CHANGE MAY BE MORE EXPOSED TO THE SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS THAT THE EARTH IS WARMING AND THAT PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE
POD0000004798_S0000103 YOU KNOW
POD0000004798_S0000132 AND SATURDAY NIGHT YOU KNOW I TUNED IN I WAS LIKE OK WHAT'S THIS GOING TO BE
POD0000004798_S0000152 TOUGH
POD0000004806_S0000013 WELL THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME TO GET THIS ON THE CENSUS
POD0000004806_S0000028 NOW THROUGH A COURT PROCESS RATHER THAN THROUGH LEGISLATION
POD0000004806_S0000048 PHILOSOPHICAL DOCUMENT IN THE SENSE THAT I FEEL LIKE IT'S VERY AMBITIOUS
POD0000004806_S0000063 AND YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO GET IT DONE THERE SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET IT DONE ON A NATIONAL LEVEL WELL AND LET'S MAKE SOMETHING VERY CLEAR AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS ARE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC ELECTORATE YEAH AND HE'S POLLING CLOSE TO ZERO WITH THEM
POD0000004806_S0000088 AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE BERNIE SANDERS AND ELIZABETH WARREN
POD0000004806_S0000123 AND THEN WHATEVER YOUR LAST TEXT MESSAGE WAS THAT'S YOUR SLOGAN SO ASMA I'M PUTTING YOU ON THE SPOT WHAT WAS YOUR VERY LAST TEXT MESSAGE
POD0000004806_S0000147 HEY
POD0000004806_S0000167 BUT HE SAID
POD0000004806_S0000172 I HAVE DECIDED TO RETURN YOUR CONTRIBUTION OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE IT APPEARS YOU MAY NEED THE MONEY MORE THAN I DO RIGHT NOW
POD0000004814_S0000016 THE JUDGE IN THIS CASE CALLED THAT RANGE WAY OUT OF WHACK
POD0000004814_S0000026 SPEND SOME TIME IN A FEDERAL PRISON YEAH BUT THAT SAID PEOPLE WILL POINT OUT THAT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE DEALING DRUGS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU'D GET A MUCH HIGHER SENTENCE MAYBE BUT AGAIN
POD0000004814_S0000042 HIS PROFESSIONAL AND FINANCIAL LIFE ARE IN SHAMBLES HE SAID AND HE ALSO ADDED THAT HE'S HAD TIME TO REFLECT WHILE HE'S IN JAIL HE WANTS TO TURN HIS NOTORIETY INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE
POD0000004814_S0000049 YOU DIDN'T SAY SORRY
POD0000004814_S0000060 WE SHOULD FIRST BACK UP THOUGH AND EXPLAIN WHY THIS WAS HAPPENING THIS WEEK YEAH LET'S GO BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNING WE'VE PROBABLY TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE ON THE PODCAST BUT MINNESOTA DEMOCRATIC FRESHMAN CONGRESSWOMAN ILHAN OMAR SHE IS ONE OF THE FIRST TWO MUSLIM WOMEN EVER ELECTED TO CONGRESS AND SHE'S ALREADY CAUSED A BIT OF CONTROVERSY THIS YEAR
POD0000004814_S0000083 WHAT WAS DIFFERENT THIS SECOND TIME AROUND IS SHE ACTUALLY REFUSED TO APOLOGIZE SHE REALLY PUSHED BACK AGAINST THIS IDEA THAT WHAT SHE WAS SAYING WAS ANTI-SEMITIC
POD0000004814_S0000098 OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS WHICH IS
POD0000004814_S0000106 AND IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH ANOTHER GUY WHOSE NAME STARTS WITH B MICHAEL BENNET
POD0000004814_S0000116 SO IT COMES AS A BIT OF SURPRISE THAT HE'S GETTING OUT JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING PRECIPITATING IT BUT HE DID ANNOUNCE TO A GROUP OF OHIO REPORTERS THAT HE WAS GOING TO GET OUT BUT HE WAS STILL GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A VOICE
POD0000004814_S0000126 IS THIS REALLY A POINT ESPECIALLY FOR DEMOCRATS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO ELEVATE A BILLIONAIRE WHEN THERE'S ALL THIS TALK ABOUT INEQUALITY AND THINGS LIKE THAT HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT HOW DO YOU SQUARE THAT
POD0000004814_S0000141 HE KIND OF HAD TO WALK THAT BACK BECAUSE OF ISSUES
POD0000004814_S0000153 I DIDN'T TRUST THE SYSTEM AT THE TIME
POD0000004814_S0000158 AND IN ONE CASE I WAS PREYED UPON AND THEN RAPED BY A SUPERIOR OFFICER
POD0000004814_S0000165 AND THEN IN THIS HEARING SHE REVEALS A RAPE AS A MEMBER OF THE MILITARY AND ON TOP OF THAT
POD0000004814_S0000184 AYESHA YOU WANT TO GO FIRST
POD0000004814_S0000190 YOU KNOW PACING AROUND POUNDING HIS CHEST I DIDN'T DO THIS STUFF
POD0000004814_S0000211 SHE WHEN SHE WAS LIKE SIXTEEN THERE STARTED TO BE THESE RUMORS THAT SHE HAD GOTTEN LIP IMPLANTS OR FILLERS OR SOMETHING CAUSE HER LIPS WERE SUDDENLY HUGE
POD0000004814_S0000218 AND THEN LATER SHE ADMITTED OH YEAH I DID GET FILLERS I LIKE IT CAUSE IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE FUNNY STORIES WHERE YOU'RE LIKE ONLY IN AMERICA CAN A CHILD BORN TO PRIVILEGE WORTH MILLIONS
POD0000004814_S0000234 AND I INITIALLY KIND OF ROLLED MY EYES CAUSE I WAS LIKE MAN HOW ARE YOU CAPITALIZING ON THIS ACTOR'S DEATH
POD0000004814_S0000245 BUT I'M GOING TO FIGHT THIS
POD0000004814_S0000250 I HAVE TO BECAUSE UNDER THE TERMS OF MY CONTRACT
POD0000004822_S0000012 HAD THE HIGHEST VOTER TURNOUT IN THE MIDTERMS OUT OF ANY DISTRICT IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY
POD0000004822_S0000021 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HE SAID IN COURT THAT PROVIDE DETAILS AS TO WHAT EXACTLY HE LIED ABOUT AND THERE ARE KIND OF THREE BUCKETS ONE IS TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE DISCUSSIONS
POD0000004822_S0000039 TURNS OUT THAT WAS ALSO A LIE THAT WAS NOT TRUE
POD0000004822_S0000053 ONE WAS TO MINIMIZE LINKS BETWEEN THIS PROJECT AND DONALD TRUMP
POD0000004822_S0000063 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FALSE OR MISLEADING CLAIMS AS PRESIDENT THERE'S ONE THING TO BEAR IN MIND AS YOU KIND OF DIGEST THE NEWS OF TODAY AND WHAT MICHAEL COHEN HAS PLEADED GUILTY TO AND WHAT HE SAYS DID INDEED TRANSPIRE AND THAT IS
POD0000004822_S0000071 YES HE PROBABLY WILL GO AHEAD HE SAID HE THINKS IT'S A VERY GOOD TIME TO HAVE A MEETING
POD0000004822_S0000079 THEY HAVEN'T RELEASED THE SAILORS SO WE CAN'T GO FORWARD WITH THE MEETING
POD0000004822_S0000088 THAT'S NOT ILLEGAL BUT IT IS VERY RARE GENERALLY WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL AGREES TO COOPERATE WITH PROSECUTORS THEY BREAK OFF ANY SORT OF JOINT DEFENSE AGREEMENT THAT THEY HAVE WITH OTHER DEFENSE ATTORNEYS
POD0000004822_S0000097 BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS REALLY UNDERSCORED THAT AND TAKEN THE SAUDIS' SIDE NOT ONLY IN CONFLICTS WITH THE MUTUAL ENEMY OF IRAN FOR EXAMPLE BUT IN SAUDI ARABIA'S REGIONAL CONFLICT WITH QATAR
POD0000004822_S0000107 WAS BASICALLY THE WORLD IS A TOUGH AND VICIOUS PLACE
POD0000004822_S0000112 THEY DECIDED TO SORT OF MAKE THEIR DISPLEASURE KNOWN ON CAPITOL HILL YEAH THERE HAS BEEN BLUNT BIPARTISAN RESPONSE TO THIS FOR A WHILE GOING BACK TO THOSE INITIAL REPORTS BUT AFTER THAT STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT THIS WEEK MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL IN THE SENATE CALLED THE KILLING ABHORRENT AND SAID THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF RESPONSE
POD0000004822_S0000124 AND THERE'S NOT A NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST IN IT FOR THE UNITED STATES SO HOW DID ANGER FROM THE HEARING TRANSLATE TO SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL OVER THE LAST DAY OR SO
POD0000004822_S0000137 AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY FLIPPED FROM WHEN THEY HAD THE VOTE ON THIS VERY ISSUE IN THE SPRING AND IT FAILED TO TODAY
POD0000004822_S0000148 HE SENT US AN EMAIL HIS SUBJECT LINE WAS
POD0000004822_S0000157 BUT THE CORRECTION IS SAUSAGES ARE NOT FREE
POD0000004822_S0000175 ENOUGH POLITICIANS ARE NOW ON INSTAGRAM THAT A POLITICAL SCIENTIST DAVID O'CONNELL FROM DICKINSON COLLEGE
POD0000004822_S0000192 AND I DO BELIEVE I ALWAYS SAY TO MY KIDS GIVE THANKSGIVING A CHANCE DON'T PLAY THOSE CAROLS BEFORE THANKSGIVING WELL HERE'S THE THING THERE'S THIS PHENOMENON CALLED CHRISTMAS CREEP
POD0000004830_S0000023 AND TO ME IT'S A MYSTERY WHY OTHER DEMOCRATS AREN'T FOCUSED ON THE SAME PROBLEMS
POD0000004830_S0000036 A FUTURE THAT THEY CAN BE PROUD OF
POD0000004830_S0000051 HOW DOES HE PLAN TO PUSH UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME THROUGH CONGRESS CONSIDERING CONGRESS' INACTION ON WELL EVERYTHING
POD0000004830_S0000063 AND LET'S SAY YOU DO IMPLEMENT THE FREEDOM DIVIDEND NATIONWIDE BUT MAYBE THE COUNTRY FINDS ITSELF IN A BUDGET CRISIS
POD0000004830_S0000071 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE BIGGEST WINNERS IN OUR ECONOMY ARE NOT PAYING ANYTHING MEANINGFUL INTO THE PUBLIC COFFERS
POD0000004830_S0000079 I THINK THAT'S POSITIVE FOR THIS YEAR AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT SHOULD BE HAPPENING EVERY YEAR FOR THEM AND EVERYONE ELSE IS IT A BRIBE OR LIKE YOU KNOW A CHICKEN IN EVERY POT KIND OF THING
POD0000004830_S0000091 AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000004830_S0000103 YOU KNOW EVEN TONIGHT IN THE AUDIENCE THERE WERE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY FATAL OVERDOSES
POD0000004830_S0000109 THEN IT'S UP TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PUT PROPER RESOURCES TO WORK TO HELP PEOPLE GET WELL
POD0000004830_S0000115 IS THAT A LITTLE FATALISTIC
POD0000004830_S0000123 IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY COMPOSITION OF OTHER COUNTRIES NOW
POD0000004830_S0000129 YOU DON'T DO ANY OF THESE THOSE THINGS IF YOU'RE NOT AN OPTIMIST I BELIEVE WE CAN ARREST THE DECLINE OF OUR CIVILIZATION I BELIEVE WE CAN EVOLVE IN THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT WORK AND VALUE I THINK WE CAN GIVE EVERY AMERICAN A FREEDOM DIVIDEND OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IF A MAJORITY OF US GET TOGETHER AND SAY THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO
POD0000004830_S0000136 WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE THAT YET
POD0000004830_S0000154 AND I DID NOT FIND IT EASY
POD0000004830_S0000162 AND WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM IT
POD0000004830_S0000172 STAR OF THE HIGH SCHOOL PLAY STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT LIKE THAT WAS NOT THE PROFILE
POD0000004830_S0000181 HE'S LIKE OUR ORACLE ALL ROLLED INTO ONE
POD0000004838_S0000013 THE FAILURE TO PRODUCE THESE DOCUMENTS
POD0000004838_S0000022 BILL I BELIEVE YOU'RE INCORRECT ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INTENTIONS THE PRESIDENT'S BEEN CRYSTAL CLEAR NO QUID PRO QUOS OF ANY KIND CLEARLY THAT IS LANGUAGE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS USED IN THIS DEFENSE
POD0000004838_S0000037 THEIR LAWYER HAS MADE CLEAR THAT THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO APPEAR UP HERE
POD0000004838_S0000045 CONGRESS COULD DO THINGS LIKE HOLD THEM IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS BUT THAT'S REALLY JUST KIND OF LIKE A PUBLIC SLAP ON THE WRIST
POD0000004838_S0000057 ALTHOUGH ALMOST HALF OF AMERICANS SAY THEY ALREADY SUPPORT THE IMPEACHMENT OF THE PRESIDENT
POD0000004838_S0000065 WE JUST SIMPLY HAVEN'T SEEN RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO KEEP HOLD OF IT'S TRYING TO KEEP CONTROL OF THEIR BASE AND KEEP SUPPORT OF IT
POD0000004838_S0000072 DOING POLLING IN NINETY FIVE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS FIFTY FIVE HELD BY DEMOCRATS FORTY HELD BY REPUBLICANS THESE ARE CONSIDERED MAYBE THE MOST POSSIBLY SWINGABLE OR COMPETITIVE DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE MOST LAWMAKERS IN THE HOUSE ARE NEVER GOING TO FACE A TOUGH RACE UNLESS THEY FACE A TOUGH PRIMARY
POD0000004846_S0000028 AND IT SHOWED FOUR CANDIDATES BUNCHED AT THE TOP BERNIE SANDERS ELIZABETH WARREN PETE BUTTIGIEG AND JOE BIDEN
POD0000004846_S0000035 THE NON-AGGRESSION TREATY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BROKEN SO TO KIND OF GET OUR LISTENERS UP TO SPEED QUICKLY THE BIG THING THAT WE SAW THIS WEEKEND IS KIND OF THIS BREAKDOWN OF WHAT HAD BEEN A MONTHS-LONG VERY FRIENDLY CAMPAIGN BETWEEN ELIZABETH WARREN AND BERNIE SANDERS
POD0000004846_S0000052 YEAH I THINK THAT AS WE'RE SEEING BERNIE SANDERS AND HIS SURROGATES TAKE A MORE AGGRESSIVE POSTURE AS IT RELATES TO HIS OPPONENTS I'M CURIOUS TO SEE IF THE CANDIDATE FOLLOWS SUIT AND DOES SO ONSTAGE BUT THE OTHER THING TO NOTE AS DANIELLE POINTED OUT HE IS THE CANDIDATE WHO HAS A SLIM LEAD IN THAT MARQUEE IOWA POLL
POD0000004854_S0000010 IT READS
POD0000004854_S0000023 HELLO MY NAME IS FERNANDO
POD0000004854_S0000031 THE RECORDS SHOW FIFTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE LIVED IN TWELVE POINT FOUR MILLION HOUSEHOLDS OVER TIME THE CENSUS BECAME A MORE COMPLEX UNDERTAKING
POD0000004854_S0000042 REPRESENTATIVES AND DIRECT TAXES ACCORDING TO MARGO IT'S THAT FIRST PART OF THE PHRASE FROM THE CONSTITUTION THAT'S HAD A REAL LASTING IMPACT
POD0000004854_S0000048 NOT REALLY
POD0000004854_S0000056 THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WOULD HAVE SERIOUS IMPACTS ON THE POWER BALANCE IN UNITED STATES POLITICS
POD0000004854_S0000071 SLAVES WOULD COUNT AS THREE-FIFTHS PERSONS
POD0000004854_S0000082 AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SENT OUT A LETTER ACTUALLY THOMAS JEFFERSON WHO WAS SECRETARY OF STATE WITH VERY FEW INSTRUCTIONS BEYOND PLEASE GO AROUND TO YOUR AREA AND COUNT EVERYBODY
POD0000004854_S0000092 THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THREE POINT NINE MILLION PEOPLE LIVED IN THE U S EXCLUDING SOME NATIVE AMERICANS WHO UNDERSTANDABLY
POD0000004854_S0000099 OH
POD0000004854_S0000108 SO HERE WE GO
POD0000004854_S0000122 PUSHING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO OUTLAW SLAVERY IN NEWLY GAINED TERRITORIES
POD0000004854_S0000136 BUT WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO ADD THE MULATTO CATEGORY
POD0000004854_S0000152 PELASGIANS IBERIANS OR JEWS THEY PRODUCE OFFSPRING PERFECTLY PROLIFIC
POD0000004854_S0000159 THIS OPINION IS NOW BECOMING GENERAL AMONG OBSERVERS IN OUR SLAVE STATES JOSIAH NOTT WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN THE CENSUS AND HE IMPRESSED UPON A PARTICULAR SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY JOSEPH UNDERWOOD
POD0000004854_S0000173 BUT ANOTHER GROUP A VERY UNLIKELY ONE
POD0000004854_S0000179 DID MORE THAN JUST CHANGE THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT COUNTED PEOPLE THE CENSUS AT THAT POINT ISN'T MERELY COUNTING BY RACE QUOTE-UNQUOTE IT'S MAKING RACE
POD0000004854_S0000191 AS THE EIGHTEEN FIFTY S WENT ON AND THE COUNTRY INCHED CLOSER TOWARDS CIVIL WAR
POD0000004854_S0000203 AND THE CENSUS IS ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES OF HIS DATA
POD0000004854_S0000219 AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I REALLY ENJOYED IT AND I YOU HE SHE THEY AND WE ARE LISTENING TO THROUGHLINE FROM NPR
POD0000004854_S0000228 AND I SHALL SHOW THAT HE HAS ALREADY NOT ONLY ADAPTED CIRCUMSTANCE TO RACE BUT ALSO
POD0000004854_S0000240 INCLUDING QUADROON AND OCTOROON
POD0000004854_S0000247 ARGUING THAT THERE WAS NO WAY TO PROVE HOW WHITE A PERSON WAS
POD0000004854_S0000253 IT WAS UNCLEAR HOW AFRICAN AMERICANS SHOULD FIT INTO AMERICAN SOCIETY
POD0000004854_S0000263 BIBLES IN COURTS WHEN YOU GO TO PUT YOUR HAND ON A BIBLE
POD0000004854_S0000272 THE CENSUS DATA WAS USED TO REINFORCE THE STATUS QUO
POD0000004854_S0000280 AND OUR FIRST IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION LAWS REALLY WERE AIMED AT THE CHINESE
POD0000004854_S0000290 WOULD YOU REFER TO THE IRISH AS A RACE
POD0000004854_S0000299 WHICH IS ONCE THE DATA ARE COLLECTED
POD0000004854_S0000314 NEGRO AFTER THAT
POD0000004854_S0000329 HOW ARE WE GOING TO UNDO THIS HISTORY OF RACIAL SUBORDINATION
POD0000004854_S0000342 WHERE IT'S BEEN
POD0000004862_S0000014 THEN A MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MUST VOTE TO IMPEACH
POD0000004862_S0000026 MILLIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE FREE
POD0000004862_S0000039 ACTUALLY THOUGHT HE'D EVER BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY
POD0000004862_S0000063 AT THIS POINT CLEARLY
POD0000004862_S0000081 SO THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL UPSET ABOUT JOHNSON BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS HE DEFYING CONGRESS BUT THEN SLOWLY AND SURELY HE BEGINS TO DEFY THE MILITARY
POD0000004862_S0000092 HE TRIES TO FIRE STANTON AND STANTON WON'T LEAVE
POD0000004862_S0000114 IT'S UP OR DOWN IT'S LIKE WHAT ARE THE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS
POD0000004862_S0000125 MY NAME IS KELVIN SANTOS
POD0000004862_S0000138 BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT ALSO SUGGESTS HOPE
POD0000004870_S0000013 SHE'S BECOME A FOIL TO PRESIDENT TRUMP
POD0000004870_S0000027 SHE SAYS THAT WHAT PELOSI LEARNED AS A GIRL WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF OLD-FASHIONED MACHINE POLITICS
POD0000004870_S0000037 SHE WENT TO COLLEGE GOT MARRIED SHE HAD FIVE CHILDREN IN SIX YEARS AND MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO
POD0000004870_S0000042 THEY WENT CANVASSING AND SHE GENERALLY HAD A STROLLER OR TWO WITH HER AND MAYBE ONE BY THE HAND SO NANCY WHOSE LAST NAME WAS NOW PELOSI
POD0000004870_S0000049 TO MANY IT SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS CUTTING IN LINE
POD0000004870_S0000062 SHE WAS GOING TO PLAY THE GAME THE WAY SHE KNEW HOW
POD0000004870_S0000077 IT'S THE FAVOR FILE ALL OVER AGAIN
POD0000004870_S0000093 WHAT I THINK HAS ALLOWED HER TO REMAIN AND STRENGTHEN IS THAT WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THE LIBERAL PROGRESSIVE WING
POD0000004870_S0000108 SO ON HER FIRST DAY SHE MET WITH PELOSI
POD0000004870_S0000121 BUT I ALWAYS SAY YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT PARTY POLITICS ARE TEAM POLITICS
POD0000004870_S0000129 HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADERS UNVEILED LEGISLATION ON HEALTH CARE
POD0000004870_S0000153 MAYBE MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE INCLUDING PRESIDENT OBAMA
POD0000004870_S0000181 BUT NOT EVERYONE IN HER PARTY WAS EXCITED ABOUT THAT IDEA
POD0000004870_S0000195 NOW WHAT DO YOU NEED
POD0000004878_S0000024 OVER THE PAST FORTY YEARS THIS ONGOING ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES HAS LED TO VIOLENT
POD0000004878_S0000037 IRAN HAD SUCCEEDED IN EXPELLING IRAQI FORCES OUT OF IRAN
POD0000004878_S0000053 IS AN INCREDIBLY CRUCIAL GEO-ECONOMIC CHOKEHOLD ONCE THROUGH THE ENTRANCE THE STRAITS OF HORMUZ
POD0000004878_S0000078 WE HAD NO PRIOR MILITARY EXPERIENCE WITH THE IRANIANS
POD0000004878_S0000097 THE HELICOPTER THOUGHT THEY WERE UNDER ATTACK AND REPORTED IT AS SUCH
POD0000004878_S0000123 THE LEVEL OF CONFLICT WITHIN A CERTAIN KIND OF RELATIVELY NARROW BAND
POD0000004878_S0000149 YOU COULD HEAR A PIN DROP
POD0000004878_S0000174 AND SO AS A RESULT OF THESE TWO THINGS ALL OF A SUDDEN
POD0000004878_S0000219 STARTED TO CONTEMPLATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF OFFENSIVE CYBER CAPABILITIES
POD0000004878_S0000228 SO FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND AND THREE
POD0000004878_S0000253 SO BETWEEN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
POD0000004878_S0000265 SO TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THEY UNLEASHED THAT FIRST VERSION OF STUXNET
POD0000004878_S0000273 AND IT JUST KEEPS STORING AND STORING FOR DAYS
POD0000004878_S0000283 SO THESE AUTOMATED SAFETY MECHANISMS WERE DESIGNED TO DETECT IF THE PRESSURE INSIDE THE CENTRIFUGES INCREASES
POD0000004878_S0000293 THIS IS A COVERT OPERATION AND A COVERT OPERATION HAS TO BE AUTHORIZED BY THE SITTING PRESIDENT
POD0000004878_S0000300 AND HE EXPLAINS WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHAT IT'S DESIGNED TO DO AND TELLS HIM THAT IT'S NOT IT HASN'T ACHIEVED ITS FULL PURPOSE YET AND ENCOURAGES OBAMA TO REAUTHORIZE THE OLYMPIC GAMES PROGRAM
POD0000004878_S0000305 THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY IS SENDING INSPECTORS TO THE NATANZ FACILITY ON AVERAGE ABOUT TWICE A MONTH
POD0000004878_S0000323 THEY IMMEDIATELY DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS MALWARE AND THAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO SPREAD TO ANY WINDOWS MACHINE
POD0000004878_S0000333 IT'S NOW BEEN FOUND IN SO IF YOU CAN IMAGINE FROM NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN ALL THE WAY TO NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
POD0000004878_S0000347 YOUR VICTIM CAN'T PICK UP THOSE PIECES OF THE WEAPON AND RECONSTITUTE IT AND SEND IT BACK AT YOU
POD0000004878_S0000353 IN THE U S WE'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS ADVANTAGE OF GEOGRAPHY
POD0000004886_S0000028 DESCRIBING WHAT HE IMAGINED A MOON EXPEDITION MIGHT LOOK LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN WHEN THE CIVIL WAR WAS JUST COMING TO AN END
POD0000004886_S0000038 IT WAS A TRIUMPHANT MOMENT FOR THE U S WE BEAT THE SOVIETS TO THE MOON REACHED A NEW FRONTIER
POD0000004886_S0000047 GETTING LOST IN THE FANTASY
POD0000004886_S0000058 UNTIL THE NAZI PARTY TOOK POWER
POD0000004886_S0000063 PUMPING MORE AND MORE MONEY INTO IT
POD0000004886_S0000087 HE QUICKLY CLIMBED THE RANKS OF THE ROCKET PROGRAM TO BECOME ONE OF ITS LEADERS
POD0000004886_S0000093 BUT HE WAS ALSO ABLE TO ESSENTIALLY BE
POD0000004886_S0000115 OPPRESSION
POD0000004886_S0000142 THE TIDE OF WAR COULD HAVE GONE IN A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION WITH THE END OF THE WAR LOOMING
POD0000004886_S0000155 THE PAPER CLIP INDICATED THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT GETTING THAT SCIENTIST APPROVED FOR A VISA BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT
POD0000004886_S0000172 SOON AFTER THE WAR ENDED
POD0000004886_S0000191 MORE THAN A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER THE END OF THE WAR WHEN THIS PROGRAM WAS FINALLY DECLASSIFIED
POD0000004886_S0000199 LESS GUILTY STILL WHEN THE AMERICAN PUBLIC FOUND OUT ABOUT THE OPERATION
POD0000004886_S0000208 THEY WERE SETTLED AT FORT BLISS OUTSIDE EL PASO TEXAS
POD0000004886_S0000214 A NEW RACE WAS ON
POD0000004886_S0000225 HE HAD TO SELL THE IDEA OF SPACE TRAVEL
POD0000004886_S0000246 ME AND THESE EFFORTS TO CREATE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR A SPACE PROGRAM WORKED DELUXE MAN IN SPACE
POD0000004886_S0000257 SOME AMERICAN POLITICIANS WERE ANGRY
POD0000004886_S0000268 SO IT'S PROBABLY NO SURPRISE THAT NASA'S MAIN OBJECTIVE ALSO QUICKLY BECAME
POD0000004886_S0000291 SO THE HEIGHT OF VON BRAUN'S FAME MOST CERTAINLY COMES IN THE TICKER TAPE PARADE MOMENT AFTER THE AMERICANS SUCCESSFULLY LAND ON THE MOON YEAH THE MOON LANDING WAS A GREAT TRIUMPH FOR HIM PERSONALLY
POD0000004886_S0000307 SHE FILED FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUESTS AND FORCED THE U S ARMY INTO DECLASSIFYING MANY OF THESE PAPERCLIP FILES WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME REVEALED THE TRUTH ABOUT THE GERMAN SCIENTISTS
POD0000004886_S0000313 HE WAS ABLE TO GET AMERICA'S FIRST SATELLITE INTO SPACE
POD0000004886_S0000326 ALSO FEEL FREE TO ADD YOUR FAVORITE ZOMBIE MOVIE OR ANYTHING ZOMBIE-RELATED
POD0000004894_S0000024 A MAN FOLLOWED BY THREE GUNMEN EMERGED FROM THE CROWD AND BEGAN WALKING FIERCELY TOWARDS THE MOSQUE'S IMAM
POD0000004894_S0000040 MANY OTHERS RAN FOR THEIR LIVES
POD0000004894_S0000058 FOR DECADES IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST EXPORTERS OF OIL
POD0000004894_S0000075 AND I'M LISTENING TO THROUGHLINE
POD0000004894_S0000083 SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE
POD0000004894_S0000092 WHO IS JUHAYMAN
POD0000004894_S0000111 THEIR RELIGIOUS FANATICISM MADE THEM EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE SOLDIERS FOR THE SAUDI ARMY
POD0000004894_S0000127 FELT NOT ONLY DISGUSTED BY THE MODERNIZATION IN THE COUNTRY
POD0000004894_S0000144 HE LIVED AN AUSTERE PIOUS LIFE
POD0000004894_S0000154 JUHAYMAN'S GROUP CONTINUED ORGANIZING AT THIS TIME JUHAYMAN WAS JUST ONE OF MANY EMERGING LEADERS IN THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT IN THE KINGDOM
POD0000004894_S0000175 ESPECIALLY EGYPT
POD0000004894_S0000187 SHOULD THEY BE IN CHARGE OF THEM
POD0000004894_S0000205 JUHAYMAN AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SEIZED THE GRAND MOSQUE TAKING NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SCARED
POD0000004894_S0000224 THEY REALIZED THEY HAD A PROBLEM
POD0000004894_S0000234 HE EXPLAINED THAT LOCAL PEOPLE KNEW SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING IN THE GRAND MOSQUE BUT NOTHING ABOUT WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE
POD0000004894_S0000244 SO THE U S GOVERNMENT
POD0000004894_S0000271 OK SO REMEMBER SHEIKH IBN BAZ
POD0000004894_S0000291 THERE IS NO INTERFERENCE IN EACH OTHER'S BUSINESS THE SAUDIS FEARED THAT THIS ARRANGEMENT COULD BE IN JEOPARDY IF THE ULEMA WERE ABLE TO EXTRACT THESE NEW DEMANDS
POD0000004894_S0000302 YOU HAVE TO SAY IT'S NOT US
POD0000004894_S0000331 ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDCORE MILITANTS REMAINED ABOVE GROUND TO FIGHT
POD0000004894_S0000364 MORE THAN SIXTY PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED INCLUDING JUHAYMAN AL-OTAIBA
POD0000004894_S0000385 ALSO BECAUSE UP UNTIL NOT SO LONG AGO
POD0000004894_S0000409 IT ALLOWED WHAT WAS A FRINGE IDEOLOGY WAHHABISM
POD0000004902_S0000015 THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION WOULD OPEN UP ACCESS TO FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS FOR STATES AND CITIES TO FIGHT THE VIRUS
POD0000004902_S0000033 YEAH THE PENTAGON LAST NIGHT SAID IT WAS BANNING ALL DOMESTIC TRAVEL FOR SERVICE MEMBERS CIVILIAN PERSONNEL AND THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF MAY MAY ELEVEN
POD0000004902_S0000044 AND OFFICIALS SAY A WEBSITE WILL HELP PEOPLE DETERMINE WHETHER THEY SHOULD GET TESTED AND WHERE
POD0000004902_S0000056 THEY JUST WISH THE ADMINISTRATION HAD DONE THIS SORT OF THING WEEKS AGO WHEN THE COUNTRY HAD A BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING AHEAD OF THE VIRUS
POD0000004902_S0000070 PEOPLE COMPLAINING
POD0000004910_S0000008 SO THAT MOVED THE CHAMBER TO CONSIDER THIS LAST PHASE OF THE TRIAL EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD A RESOLUTION SETTING OUT THE PARAMETERS FOR HOW THIS TRIAL WOULD PLAY OUT TO THIS POINT
POD0000004910_S0000013 WE DO NOT WANT IT IN THE DARK OF NIGHT
POD0000004910_S0000018 THAT WOULD BE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS AND THE PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE TEAM
POD0000004910_S0000023 AND THEN OF COURSE ON TUESDAY EVENING PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SLATED TO DELIVER HIS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS SO PLENTY OF ACTION AHEAD IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND JUST GOING BACK TO LAST NIGHT'S VOTE FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WITNESSES THERE WAS NEWS EVEN AS SENATORS WERE ANNOUNCING WHICH WAY THEY PLANNED TO VOTE RIGHT
POD0000004910_S0000028 GOT EIGHT WITNESSES SAYING THAT YOU LEFT THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT
POD0000004910_S0000036 HERE IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE SEVEN REPORTED CASES
POD0000004910_S0000045 I SHOULD MENTION THAT OTHER NATIONS INCLUDING FRANCE AND THE U K AND AUSTRALIA HAVE BEEN QUARANTINING THEIR CITIZENS RETURNING FROM THESE CORONAVIRUS HOTSPOTS OK BUT WHY USE QUARANTINES WHEN WE'VE HAD JUST SEVEN CASES SO FAR IN THE UNITED STATES AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS KEEP TELLING US THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS NOT AT RISK
POD0000004910_S0000053 NOW WE KNOW FROM A RECENT REPORT FROM GERMANY THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CASE SO THAT POTENTIALLY MAKES IT A LOT HARDER TO BOTTLE UP
POD0000004910_S0000070 LIKE I MAY DISAGREE WITH THEM ON SOME
POD0000004918_S0000008 HE'S COMPLAINED FOR YEARS ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY THE U S CONTRIBUTES TO THE ALLIANCE AND TIS THE SEASON WE GOT NORTH FACE ITEMS
POD0000004918_S0000022 FOR THE CONSERVATIVES THERE'LL BE QUESTIONS FOR THE HOME SECRETARY ABOUT WHY ONLY THREE WEEKS AGO SHE REDUCED THE TERROR THREAT IN THE U K FROM SEVERE TO SUBSTANTIAL
POD0000004918_S0000030 OF COURSE IN THE U K
POD0000004918_S0000054 BUT HE'S NOT THE ONLY WORLD LEADER HAVING PROBLEMS AT HOME
POD0000004918_S0000070 AND THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY TO ME AND A LOT OF RETAIL WATCHERS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THEMES THIS YEAR IS THIS SLOW CHANGE OF THE MEANING OF BLACK FRIDAY IS IT BEGINNING TO DISAPPEAR OR IS IT JUST GOING ONLINE
POD0000004926_S0000017 WHAT THE RECORD WOULD BE LIKE YOU KNOW WITH PHIFE YOU KNOW SUFFERING FROM AN ILLNESS WHICH EVENTUALLY TOOK HIS LIFE IN THE MIDST OF RECORDING IT BY THE TIME THE RECORD CAME OUT OF COURSE HE HAD ALREADY PASSED THERE WAS THE ELECTION AS WELL
POD0000004926_S0000024 REMEMBER YOU AND CONNECT WITH YOU
POD0000004926_S0000045 I SAID

POD0000004926_S0000185 DEFINITELY
POD0000004926_S0000211 A LITTLE CONTEXT FOR OUR AUDIENCE BASICALLY THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS SAYING THE STATE HAS A SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL FUNDING SYSTEM THAT'S LEFT THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM STRAPPED FOR CASH
POD0000004926_S0000224 AND SO I WAS WORKING ON A DEAL USING MY CHARM
POD0000004926_S0000249 AND SO IF YOUR SCHOOL GETS GOOD ENOUGH TEST SCORES ALL AROUND
POD0000004926_S0000276 MY WIFE AND I WE ENCOUNTER A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT WITH HIM
POD0000004926_S0000297 MY NIGGAS ARE DYING BEFORE THEIR TIME

POD0000004934_S0000114 I CONNECTED TO THE LONELINESS OF BEING THAT AGE AND FINDING A GROUP OF PEOPLE RIGHT
POD0000004934_S0000125 VULNERABLE HE'S SO VULNERABLE IN THAT SONG AND I THINK THAT IS NOW HIP-HOP IN A LOT OF WAYS LIKE DRAKE
POD0000004934_S0000137 RIGHT
POD0000004934_S0000143 I THINK THEY WERE MORE SAD TO SEE HOW I FELT GROWING UP

POD0000005172_S0000195 AND IT MEANS NOTHING
POD0000005172_S0000213 EXPRESSIVE AUTHENTIC DIRECT AND ASSERTIVE
POD0000005172_S0000226 WE FEEL GUILTY AT FIRST DOING IT
POD0000005172_S0000236 TALK TO THAT PERSON AND SEE WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS
POD0000005172_S0000248 WHICH IS PROBABLY GONNA BE GUILT AND ANXIETY THOSE ARE THE TWO BIGGEST DISCOMFORTS
POD0000005172_S0000254 WE CALM OURSELVES AND OVER TIME WE START TO SEE WOW THE WORLD'S NOT FALLING APART
POD0000005172_S0000273 AND USUALLY IF WE'VE BEEN NICE FOR TEN TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY YEARS WHATEVER WE HAVEN'T BUILT THAT SKILL
POD0000005172_S0000282 OR KIND OF HARSH AND DEFENSIVE
POD0000005172_S0000299 IF SOMEONE INVITES YOU TO DO SOMETHING
POD0000005172_S0000319 I WANT TO TELL YOU THOUGH THAT PERSONALLY I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF BASEBALL
POD0000005172_S0000332 LIKE WHAT IS THE MINDSET SHIFT THAT HAS TO HAPPEN SO YOU STOP PEOPLE PLEASING ALL THE TIME
POD0000005172_S0000343 AND IT MIGHT NOT BE THIS INTENSE KIND OF GROVELING I NEED THIS ENERGY BUT JUST IT'S IN THERE IN THE BACKGROUND
POD0000005172_S0000350 TO SHIFT THIS IS
POD0000005172_S0000363 MAYBE OUR PARENT IS REALLY BUSY A LOT OF THE TIME
POD0000005172_S0000372 SO THEN I GO TO YOU AND I'M LIKE CAN I PLUG MY HOSE IN WITH YOU
POD0000005172_S0000382 INSTEAD OF SCRAMBLING SO MUCH TO GET IT OUT THERE
POD0000005172_S0000400 AND YOU JUST MEET IT WITH EMPATHY PATIENCE AND LOVE
POD0000005172_S0000423 DOES THAT BOTHER YOU
POD0000005172_S0000428 MAYBE MAYBE NOT THEN THEY START TO WALK OVER TO TALK TO YOU AND THEY STEP ON YOUR FLOWERS
POD0000005172_S0000439 THAT'S LIKE SOMEONE STEPPING ON YOUR FLOWERS
POD0000005172_S0000457 BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY I MEAN
POD0000005172_S0000475 AND SAME THING IF YOU VALUE KINDNESS AND RESPECT AND YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO BE KIND AND RESPECT PEOPLE AND THEN YOU TREAT THEM IN A DISRESPECTFUL WAY
POD0000005172_S0000486 AND SO PARENTS WANT TO GET IN THERE AND STOP THAT BEHAVIOR RIGHT AWAY
POD0000005172_S0000495 SELF-DIRECTED
POD0000005172_S0000501 BUT CAN I FIND IT IN MYSELF TO STILL LOVINGLY TELL THEM NO
POD0000005180_S0000021 BUT THEY ALWAYS MADE AN EFFORT TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE
POD0000005180_S0000030 AND I REALIZED THAT'S WHERE MY TALENT WAS THAT THAT'S WHERE I COULD REALLY HELP PEOPLE AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS WORLD
POD0000005180_S0000043 AND WHAT WE ALL DO IS WE CREATE LIMITS AT SOME POINT LIKE I'M GOING TO GO THIS FAR
POD0000005180_S0000052 NOT ONLY INSIDE THE GYM
POD0000005180_S0000063 I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS
POD0000005180_S0000078 WHERE WE'LL GO TO A DOCTOR AND WE'LL GET A PRESCRIPTION
POD0000005180_S0000084 BUT SOMETHING THAT IS FREE
POD0000005180_S0000093 BECAUSE EVERYONE TELLS ME HEY BOBBY YOU SHOULD START A PODCAST
POD0000005180_S0000103 GOOD
POD0000005180_S0000111 THE PRICE DOESN'T GO DOWN
POD0000005180_S0000123 THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED IS EASY
POD0000005180_S0000133 YOU'RE LIKE WELL
POD0000005180_S0000142 BUT IT'S NOT THAT'S JUST OVERCOMING THOSE SELF-IMPOSED LIMITATIONS AND GAINING THAT CONFIDENCE
POD0000005180_S0000150 AND THAT IS TO MAKE THEM BETTER AT BASKETBALL I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR ENDURANCE AT THAT POINT OR METABOLIC CONDITIONING
POD0000005180_S0000157 YOU'VE GOT A GOOD LEVEL OF STRENGTH YOU'VE GOT A GOOD LEVEL OF ENDURANCE YOU'VE GOT A GOOD LEVEL OF METABOLIC CONDITIONING I TEND TO INCLUDE ALL THOSE THINGS
POD0000005180_S0000168 ENDURANCE WILL HURT HIS STRENGTH TO A DEGREE BUT FOR NORMAL PEOPLE
POD0000005180_S0000179 CAUSE THEY'RE BRUTAL
POD0000005180_S0000187 TWO BURPEES
POD0000005180_S0000194 I'VE COME TO CALL IT THE MOMENT
POD0000005180_S0000202 IT CAN BE A FINISHER BECAUSE AGAIN
POD0000005180_S0000212 FOR MY PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES THAT COULD REALLY AFFECT THEIR PAYCHECK OR AFFECT THEIR LIFE AND FOR MY NORMAL PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST TRAINING
POD0000005180_S0000221 YOU'VE GOT TO PAY FOR IT SOMEHOW
POD0000005180_S0000232 NOW YOU'RE EFFECTIVE NOW YOU'RE REALLY CAPABLE OF DOING SOMETHING YOU'VE GOT SOME REAL GENUINE HORSEPOWER BEHIND YOU AND YOU CAN GET WORK DONE
POD0000005180_S0000243 GET A MASSAGE
POD0000005180_S0000253 BUT IT WASN'T HARD I USED TO GO TO BED AT TEN OR ELEVEN AND WAKE UP AT SEVEN OR EIGHT
POD0000005180_S0000265 IS IT COMES DOWN TO HOW BAD YOU WANT SOMETHING
POD0000005180_S0000272 CAUSE AGAIN IT'S MY ANCHOR IT'S MY SAFE PLACE IT IS
POD0000005180_S0000281 YEAH AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO FOR ME IT COMES DOWN TO PERSPECTIVE SO THE DISEASE I HAD WAS COLOSTRUM DIFFICILE IT'S A PRETTY BAD STOMACH BACTERIA
POD0000005180_S0000293 IT CAN ALWAYS GET WORSE
POD0000005180_S0000305 YOU DIDN'T WAKE UP TO BE MEDIOCRE IT'S A REMINDER THAT YOU DIDN'T WAKE UP TO JUST DO THE STATUS QUO
POD0000005188_S0000020 I WAS INVOLVED WITH SOME COUNTRY STUDIES
POD0000005188_S0000033 AND THAT IS THE VULNERABILITY OF STAFFING
POD0000005188_S0000044 AND THEN AT A MINIMAL LEVEL
POD0000005188_S0000059 MOST WATER HAS TO GO THROUGH FILTERS
POD0000005188_S0000071 YEAH IF TOILETS AREN'T FLUSHING THEN UNFORTUNATELY WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY THAT IS NOT USED TO THE THIRD WORLD STANDARDS OF CLEANLINESS
POD0000005188_S0000080 YOU NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST PLAIN HYPOCHLORITE BLEACH ON HAND
POD0000005188_S0000088 SEWAGE GONE AS WELL
POD0000005188_S0000095 EVERYONE ELSE HAS TO DEPEND ON PRESSURE STATIONS AND IF THE POWER GRID GOES DOWN FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME
POD0000005188_S0000109 JUST IN TIME INVENTORY CONTROL SYSTEM WHICH IS A MODERN MIRACLE ACTUALLY WAS COPIED FROM THE JAPANESE KANBAN SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT
POD0000005188_S0000121 I LIKE TO SAY THAT FEMA ACTUALLY STANDS FOR FOOLISHLY EXPECTING MEANINGFUL AID WELL
POD0000005188_S0000129 IF YOU HAVE THE MINDSET OF A WELL-PREPARED INDIVIDUAL WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF HIS FAMILY AND HIS NEIGHBORS
POD0000005188_S0000138 SORRY FOR EXAMPLE
POD0000005188_S0000160 AND SOME BUDGETING
POD0000005188_S0000167 I DIDN'T PLAN AHEAD
POD0000005188_S0000185 IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY FOR IT
POD0000005188_S0000200 TO MAXIMIZE FOOD STORAGE
POD0000005188_S0000214 AND
POD0000005188_S0000223 AND THERE'S ALSO A ACCLIMATION CURVE
POD0000005188_S0000232 YOU NEED TO HAVE THE SKILLS TO GO WITH THEM THAT TAKES EXPERIENCE IT TAKES TIME IT TAKES TRIAL AND ERROR
POD0000005188_S0000240 BUT IF SOMEONE COMES BARGING IN YOUR FRONT DOOR AND TAKES IT ALL AWAY FROM YOU
POD0000005188_S0000248 IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THAT ITEM ITSELF
POD0000005188_S0000260 IN DEFENDING A COMMUNITY WHEN EVERYTHING FALLS APART IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO COMMUNICATIONS
POD0000005188_S0000272 YOU'RE INEFFECTIVE
POD0000005188_S0000285 THAT USES THE MURS BAND SO THE SAME WALKIE-TALKIE THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR BELT CAN HAVE PUSH-TO-TALK WITH YOUR NEIGHBORS
POD0000005188_S0000293 GASOLINE LOGISTICS IS PROBABLY GOING DOWN WITH IT
POD0000005188_S0000313 YOU SHOULD AT LEAST TAKE ALL THE AMERICAN RED CROSS COURSES
POD0000005188_S0000324 WE COULD SEE A DIE-OFF OF AS MUCH OF SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION OVER JUST ONE WINTER
POD0000005188_S0000335 WHICH I FELL
POD0000005188_S0000342 AGAIN I LOVE SPLITTING WOOD
POD0000005188_S0000351 IRONICALLY MORE THAN ANY OTHER BECAUSE IT WORKS YOUR ENTIRE BODY ALL YOUR MUSCLE GROUPS
POD0000005188_S0000357 IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SWEAT MORE YOU CAN SPEND LESS
POD0000005188_S0000372 I BELIEVE AS A CHRISTIAN YOU SHOULD GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES AND PRAY AND ASK FOR GOD'S PROVIDENCE AND GUIDANCE IN THIS
POD0000005188_S0000377 AND AGAIN STATISTICALLY YOUR CHANCES OF SURVIVAL
POD0000005188_S0000386 AND HIGH TECHNOLOGY WHERE APPROPRIATE
POD0000005196_S0000031 WHAT'S THE ROOT OF HUMOR WHERE DOES THE IMPULSE TO LAUGH EVEN COME FROM
POD0000005196_S0000064 SO COMMON TASTES HAVE TO KEEP EVOLVING SO THAT THE KIDS ARE LAUGHING AT SOMETHING THEIR PARENTS DON'T GET
POD0000005196_S0000082 AND THAT WAS JUST FINE
POD0000005196_S0000127 IT'S REALLY SHOCKING HOW RECENT THAT WAS
POD0000005196_S0000148 AND YOU'RE TESTING OUT STUFF AND PUTTING STUFF OUT THERE
POD0000005196_S0000180 INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY
POD0000005196_S0000206 WELL I MEAN IF THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY SEES THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE GET YEAH
POD0000005204_S0000019 BUT IT WAS ENOUGH ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF ADRENALINE IN MY BRAIN
POD0000005204_S0000041 AND THEN I ULTIMATELY MY WIFE GAVE ME A BOOK BY A SHRINK IN NEW YORK CITY NAMED DOCTOR MARK EPSTEIN WHO WROTE ABOUT HE WRITES BEAUTIFUL BOOKS ABOUT THE OVERLAP BETWEEN PSYCHOLOGY AND BUDDHISM
POD0000005204_S0000071 OR SOMETHING IN THERE ABOUT IN FACT WHAT THIS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN IS THAT THE BRAIN IS ALWAYS CHANGING
POD0000005204_S0000093 AND REALLY INTERESTINGLY EXPERIENCE MEDITATORS ACTUALLY ARE SEEING MUCH LESS ACTIVATION IN THE DEFAULT MODE EVEN WHEN THEY ARE NOT MEDITATING
POD0000005204_S0000100 MOSTLY NEGATIVE YAMMERING INTERNALLY
POD0000005204_S0000108 ALL OF THESE POSITIVE MENTAL STATES ACTUALLY ARE NOT FACTORY SETTING THEY ARE SKILLS THAT YOU CAN TRAIN
POD0000005204_S0000119 COMING IN AND GOING OUT
POD0000005204_S0000138 USUALLY YOU START WITH YOURSELF
POD0000005204_S0000148 IF YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE IT FEELS GOOD
POD0000005204_S0000174 THE SKILL OF KNOWING WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW WITHOUT GETTING CARRIED AWAY BY IT
POD0000005204_S0000186 WHICH IS CALLED TEN PERCENT HAPPIER
POD0000005204_S0000200 YOU'RE NOT SO BUSY TO IGNORE YOUR AUNT'S AND BE UNKIND OR PULL YOURSELF AWAY FROM THE TASK THAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO GET DONE AND REFLEXIVELY GO CHECK TWITTER
POD0000005204_S0000219 SHE'LL SAY SOMETHING THAT ANNOYS YOU
POD0000005204_S0000235 WHAT KEEPS YOU MEDITATING IS BECAUSE YOU'RE LESS OF AN ASSHOLE TO YOURSELF AND OTHERS
POD0000005204_S0000255 THIS MOTTO THAT WAS HANDED DOWN TO ME BY MY FATHER WHO'S AN ACADEMIC PHYSICIAN IN IN BOSTON
POD0000005204_S0000284 SPEAKING OF TOO FAR THE ONION ARTICLE SPEAKS TO I THINK A RELATED ISSUE WHICH IS THAT ARE YOU GOING TO BECOME VERY PREACHY AND ANNOYING
POD0000005204_S0000295 IN HOW YOU RECOMMEND THIS PRACTICE TO OTHERS AND I THINK THERE ARE TWO MODALITIES ONE I THINK IS TO JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT IT'S DONE FOR YOU IF IT COMES UP NATURALLY
POD0000005204_S0000320 I THINK THE ONE STOP SHOPPING IS TEN PERCENTHAPPIER DOT COM WHERE YOU CAN GET THE APP I MEAN THE APPS AVAILABLE
POD0000005204_S0000337 WHERE DO GERBILS RUN WILD
POD0000005212_S0000020 BUT THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO BE LINKED UP WITH CAPABILITIES BECAUSE CAPABILITIES ARE NEVER UNLIMITED
POD0000005212_S0000048 IN FACT I ARGUE IN THE BOOK PEOPLE HAVE TO BE BOTH IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING WHICH COULD BE THE ONE BIG THING BUT IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO TO KNOW WHAT'S AROUND YOU AND WHAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO RUN INTO WHICH IS KNOWING MANY THINGS
POD0000005212_S0000075 BUT THEN I TRY TO LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO MANAGED FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER OR IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER TO BE BOTH THINKING OF EVERYTHING
POD0000005212_S0000085 BUT I THINK HE WAS ALWAYS BOTH ALONG THE WAY HE SAW THAT SEQUENCE AND BALANCED IT MAGNIFICENTLY
POD0000005212_S0000097 HE COULD FIND THE PROPER DIRECTION JUST BY LOOKING DOWN AT HIS COMPASS
POD0000005212_S0000108 BUT IN HIS EXTREMELY DETAILED HISTORY
POD0000005212_S0000124 HE NEVER ACTUALLY COMPLETED THIS TEXT
POD0000005212_S0000129 BUT IF YOU READ IT IN A CERTAIN WAY IF YOU READ IT AS I SAY IN THE BOOK FROM A HIGH ALTITUDE TRYING TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL PICTURE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIND CONSISTENCY OF DETAIL IN IT
POD0000005212_S0000142 BUT NOBODY WOULD SAY THAT SOMEBODY WILL FIGHT MORE EFFECTIVELY ON A BATTLEFIELD FOR HAVING HAD NO TRAINING AT ALL
POD0000005212_S0000153 WAS SIMPLY EXPERIENCE
POD0000005212_S0000165 IT'S UP TO THE GUYS THAT ARE PLAYING THE GAME TO MAKE THE SNAP INSTANT DECISIONS
POD0000005212_S0000173 BUT I JUST FIND THAT IT'S EASIER TO EXPLAIN COACHING AND ATHLETICS TO STUDENTS THAN IT IS TO EXPLAIN OODA
POD0000005212_S0000183 AND THEN REVISIT THEM SOME FIVE YEARS LATER TEN YEARS LATER FIFTEEN YEARS LATER AND RATE THEM FOR ACCURACY
POD0000005212_S0000193 WHETHER THEY WERE RIGHT OR WRONG IN PREDICTION THEY WERE AT LEAST GOOD IN INTERVIEWS LIKE THIS ONE
POD0000005212_S0000204 YOU'LL DO VERY WELL
POD0000005212_S0000225 BUT WE HAVE VERY VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS DIFFERENT POLITICAL VIEWS DIFFERENT TEACHING VIEWS AND WE ACTUALLY CAN GET INTO SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ARGUMENTS EVEN ABOUT CLASSICAL TEXTS
POD0000005212_S0000243 GO TO EXOTIC PLACES GET OFF THE TOURIST PATH ETC
POD0000005212_S0000259 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN TALK WITH ABOUT THESE TEXTS AS WELL
POD0000005220_S0000019 BUT HIS RESPONSE WAS
POD0000005220_S0000060 HAVING PARENTS INVEST BIG MONEY AND KIDS COMING TO CAMP OR HIRING A TEAM OF SPECIALISTS
POD0000005220_S0000091 BY THE TIME THEY WERE NINETEEN
POD0000005220_S0000099 BUT FROM AGE SIX FROM AGE EIGHT THE AGE OF YOUR SON UP TILL HIGH SCHOOL
POD0000005220_S0000112 SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE MENTAL BURNOUT OF PLAYING TWELVE MONTHS A YEAR OF SOCCER TWELVE MONTHS A YEAR OF BASKETBALL
POD0000005220_S0000156 A LOT OF THE LITERATURE WOULD SAY YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO BUILD UP A LOT OF PATTERN RECOGNITION
POD0000005220_S0000175 HAVING THEM WORK IN TIGHT AREAS WHERE THEY GET THE TOUCH
POD0000005220_S0000189 AND THIS IS DR BALYI
POD0000005220_S0000209 BUT A VERY WELL-KNOWN ONE IS DANIEL KAHNEMAN AND AMOS TVERSKY KAHNEMAN WON THE NOBEL PRIZE
POD0000005220_S0000225 OF SEEING OPPORTUNITIES OOP TRIED THAT ONCE AND IT DIDN'T WORK
POD0000005220_S0000240 WOULD THAT BE A GOOD SUMMARY
POD0000005220_S0000259 AFTER A GAME YOU START UP YOUR CAR YOUR KID'S IN THE CAR
POD0000005220_S0000282 HEY IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO FOR IT FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND BEYOND
POD0000005220_S0000298 DR BECKMAN AND WHO'S
POD0000005220_S0000316 BUT USUALLY THEY ONLY SHOW BETTER VISION PERCEPTION ET CETERA
POD0000005220_S0000334 HERE AGAIN
POD0000005220_S0000372 IT'S MORE THAN JUST DOING ACUITY TEST WITH AN OPTOMETRIST
POD0000005220_S0000390 AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY HAVE EVERY YEAR FOR THE ELITE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYERS IS NIKE SPONSORS HAVE CALLED THE OPENING
POD0000005220_S0000403 AND VICE VERSA
POD0000005220_S0000424 SKIPPING A PRACTICE ISN'T GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT ALLEN IVERSON
POD0000005220_S0000440 WHAT WE WANTED TO STICK WAS THE IDEA OF DELIBERATE PRACTICE AS LEN SAID WHERE YOU'RE FOCUSING ON SOMETHING SPECIFIC PREFERABLY A WEAKNESS
POD0000005220_S0000453 IT'S CALLED THE PLAYMAKER'S ADVANTAGE
POD0000005228_S0000031 THERE'S BEEN THIS RECOGNITION OF A CATEGORY OF YOUNG MEN WHO ARE JUST TOTALLY UNINTERESTED IN ROMANTIC EXPERIENCES
POD0000005228_S0000047 STDS ARE DOWN
POD0000005228_S0000058 NOT JUST SEXUAL CONNECTIONS BUT REALLY I WOULD SAY SORT OF RELATIONSHIP CONNECTIONS MORE BROADLY
POD0000005228_S0000085 THE PROBLEM IS THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE SPENDING JUST A KIND OF UNFATHOMABLE AMOUNT OF TIME ON THESE THINGS
POD0000005228_S0000099 RIGHT IS THAT HOW IT TYPICALLY WORKS OUT
POD0000005228_S0000114 I THINK THAT'S INTERESTING IT SORT OF SUGGEST THAT MAYBE
POD0000005228_S0000132 AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WORK IS A LOT OF WHERE WE SPEND OUR TIME
POD0000005228_S0000148 SO THAT'S A BIG FACTOR TOO BUT THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES IS THIS SUBSTITUTING FOR SEX OR IS IT LIKE ITS WHOLE OWN OCCUPATION AND FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE
POD0000005228_S0000158 THAT TENDS TO BE ALMOST SELF-FULFILLING
POD0000005228_S0000164 SO IT WAS INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS WITH MEN TENDED TO SORT OF SAY MY PORN LIFE AND MY SEX LIFE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS THEY'RE NOT RELATED
POD0000005228_S0000172 BUT IT'S REALLY REALLY REALLY NOT SOMETHING YOU SHOULD SPRING ON SOMEBODY
POD0000005228_S0000221 I'M NOT PUT ON THE SPOT
POD0000005228_S0000240 LIKE WHEN THERE ARE LOTS OF UNTOUCHED YOUNG PEOPLE THAT TENDS TO BE SOCIALLY DESTABILIZING
POD0000005236_S0000014 SO I WAS LOOKING TO
POD0000005236_S0000026 AND WHAT I DID I FOUND A SUBJECT WHO LED ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE LIVES THAT I HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED
POD0000005236_S0000044 SO
POD0000005236_S0000069 IN DAVENPORT BEHIND A RADIO MICROPHONE AND HOW DID THAT HAPPEN
POD0000005236_S0000088 HE KEPT WATCHING THE TELETYPE MACHINE TO SEE IF IT WOULD COME BACK ON
POD0000005236_S0000107 AND WON
POD0000005236_S0000128 HE WON FOR SIX TERMS RUNNING
POD0000005236_S0000133 BUT IN COLLEGE AND ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD
POD0000005236_S0000159 WERE FORGIVEN THEIR TAXES
POD0000005236_S0000170 AND AS THE CAMERA FLEW OVER THE SIMULATION
POD0000005236_S0000189 AND AGAIN
POD0000005236_S0000201 HE LOVED TELLING JOKES HE TOLD SOME HOLLYWOOD STORIES
POD0000005236_S0000220 WELL YOU KNOW
POD0000005236_S0000230 NANCY HAD ONE GOAL AND ONE GOAL ONLY IN MIND AND THAT WAS TO PROTECT HER HUSBAND'S LEGACY
POD0000005236_S0000241 AND OF COURSE HE WAS A REPUBLICAN
POD0000005236_S0000252 AND REAGAN STEPS IN
POD0000005236_S0000271 WHEN HE AND GEORGE BUSH WERE RUNNING NECK AND NECK
POD0000005236_S0000276 AND IN THE BAND ROOM AT THE SCHOOL WHERE THEY WERE HOLDING THE DEBATE
POD0000005236_S0000282 AND SO ONCE THE OTHER CANDIDATES LEFT AND IT WAS JUST BUSH AND REAGAN ON THIS DAIS
POD0000005236_S0000296 AND HE DEFERRED TO THESE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY TO HIS NATIONAL SECURITY PEOPLE
POD0000005236_S0000308 AND THAT
POD0000005236_S0000330 NOT JUST A FEW AMERICANS
POD0000005236_S0000335 I HAVE A LITTLE FONDNESS FOR IT WOULD I VOTE FOR HIM TODAY
POD0000005236_S0000351 I THINK REAGAN ALWAYS FELT IT WAS COMING DOWN THE PIKE IT WAS NO SURPRISE
POD0000005236_S0000358 NANCY MADE SURE THAT HE WAS NOT SEEN PUBLICLY
POD0000005236_S0000366 AND HE HAD REALLY MISSED THE BOAT ON THE AIDS CRISIS HE COMPLETELY AVOIDED IT WHICH HE EVEN ADMITTED WAS A HUGE MISTAKE IN HIS CAREER
POD0000005244_S0000013 WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE YEAH NO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I'M GLAD THAT YOU ASKED
POD0000005244_S0000023 HE SEES THE FACT THAT WE CAN NO LONGER BELIEVE IN TRADITIONAL FORMS OF MEANING SO RELIGIOUS POLITICAL FAMILIAL
POD0000005244_S0000037 AND HE WAS AN ANTISEMITE NIETZSCHE
POD0000005244_S0000054 RALPH WALDO EMERSON SAYS ONE DAY PHILOSOPHY WILL BE DONE BY POETS
POD0000005244_S0000060 BECAUSE HE SAYS THAT
POD0000005244_S0000071 AS I'VE READ NIETZSCHE
POD0000005244_S0000078 HIS DOUBT ABOUT CONVENTIONAL OR TRADITIONAL WAYS OF BEING
POD0000005244_S0000102 SOMETHING ALONG THAT LINES YEAH
POD0000005244_S0000110 WHAT DREW YOU TO NIETZSCHE AS A YOUNG MAN
POD0000005244_S0000122 IT SAYS
POD0000005244_S0000131 DAN CONWAY AND DOUG ANDERSON
POD0000005244_S0000142 HAD CONTACTED THE MUSEUM AND HAD ARRANGED FOR ME TO STAY THERE ON THIS FIRST NINETEEN YEAR OLD JOURNEY
POD0000005244_S0000152 I JUDGE A THOUGHT ON ITS ABILITY TO WALK
POD0000005244_S0000162 STRAIGHT MISOGYNIST
POD0000005244_S0000179 HE THINKS THAT WE SHOULD EMBODY A PURPOSELESS PURPOSE WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO EXPERIENCE ART OR BEAUTY OR THE SUBLIME
POD0000005244_S0000194 BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD BE PEDESTRIANS
POD0000005244_S0000206 YEAH
POD0000005244_S0000211 THE ASCETIC IDEAL IS THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE THE POWER TO DEPRIVE OURSELVES OF THINGS
POD0000005244_S0000220 BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT FASTING IS PRETTY ADDICTIVE
POD0000005244_S0000232 THEY'RE ALL EFFORTS TO GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF TO SORT OF SEE YOUR LIMITS
POD0000005244_S0000252 HE DOESN'T MEAN TO BUM YOU OUT HE'S JUST SAYING TO YOU WHAT'S THE POINT OF LIFE IS LIFE WORTH LIVING
POD0000005244_S0000266 IMAGINE THAT IN YOUR LONELIEST OF LONELIES
POD0000005244_S0000275 CAN YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE
POD0000005244_S0000298 OR INTO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE NOT OF YOUR CHOOSING
POD0000005244_S0000311 AND THEN YOU BECOME IT FOR ALL TIME THAT'S NOT HOW HUMAN BEINGS LIVE OR DIE
POD0000005244_S0000322 YOU MUST NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF WHO YOU ARE
POD0000005244_S0000342 INSTEAD OF HIKING UP BY MYSELF
POD0000005244_S0000350 USUALLY HE'S REGARDED AS THE QUINTESSENTIAL JUVENILE PHILOSOPHER
POD0000005244_S0000368 AND IT'S A HOPE THAT YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF WIGGLE ROOM TO BE THE HYPERBOREAN IN YOUR MUNDANE LIFE
POD0000005244_S0000376 AND IT'S VERY APPEALING TO A NINETEEN YEAR OLD OR TO A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD
POD0000005244_S0000391 IT IS UP TO ME
POD0000005252_S0000012 TO DETOXIFY
POD0000005252_S0000020 THE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT CLAIMS THAT ONE FINDS IN THE LITERATURE ON FASTING COVERS A WIDE RANGE
POD0000005252_S0000032 CERTAINLY FASTING OR EATING RATHER IS MEANT TO BE ONE OF LIFE'S CHIEF JOYS
POD0000005252_S0000042 SPONSORED BY THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS MINISTRY
POD0000005252_S0000049 POWER IN FASTING I WANTED TO EXPLORE FURTHER
POD0000005252_S0000059 GIVES THE BODY A CHANCE TO RENEW ITSELF IT'S A TIME IN WHICH THE BODY BURNS ITS RUBBISH IT'S KIND OF LIKE A HOUSECLEANING DAY
POD0000005252_S0000065 AND SO FORTH
POD0000005252_S0000073 WE'RE EMBODIED SPIRITS YOU MIGHT SAY
POD0000005252_S0000081 IT DID NOT MAKE SENSE TO SIMPLY BOX IT UP AND WRITE LENT ON THAT BOX
POD0000005252_S0000088 TURN TO IT AS A BEHAVIOR THAT CLEARS AWAY THE THOUSAND LITTLE THINGS THAT CLUTTER THE MIND
POD0000005252_S0000101 GOD
POD0000005252_S0000108 SO
POD0000005252_S0000116 UNTIL THEY REST IN YOU
POD0000005252_S0000125 WOULDN'T YOU
POD0000005252_S0000131 ATONEMENT TO GOD
POD0000005252_S0000138 FASTING INCREASES OUR SENSITIVITY TO THAT DIVINE MYSTERY ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE PRESENT TO US
POD0000005252_S0000148 AND INNER NOURISHMENT FOR THE SPIRITUALLY HUNGRY
POD0000005252_S0000158 MEANS OF SHOWING SELF-HUMILIATION
POD0000005252_S0000165 THE TWO MAJOR PUBLIC FAST DAYS
POD0000005252_S0000171 ANOINTING WITH OIL
POD0000005252_S0000180 IN THIS CASE
POD0000005252_S0000187 AND NO ONE IS PERMITTED TO EAT BREAKFAST
POD0000005252_S0000198 THIS COMMEMORATES THE FACT THAT JEWISH FIRSTBORN MALES WERE SAVED FROM THE PLAGUE IN EGYPT
POD0000005252_S0000218 TAQWA IS DERIVED FROM A WORD MEANING PROTECTIVE SHIELD
POD0000005252_S0000227 AND TO SOLIDIFY THE COMMUNITY TO TRY TO FEEL THE PAINS OF THE HUNGRY
POD0000005252_S0000240 THE FASTING IS TO HAPPEN IN THE STREETS IN THE HOMES AND PLACES OF BUSINESS
POD0000005252_S0000248 AND THAT'S FOLLOWED BY A SUNSET PRAYER SINCE EVERYONE WHO EATS THE EVENING MEAL AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000005252_S0000257 A FEW DAYS IN EACH OF THE TWO MONTHS HERALDING THE COMING OF RAMADAN
POD0000005252_S0000269 FOR SIX YEARS HE DEDICATED HIMSELF TO THIS PATH
POD0000005252_S0000276 BUT CARE IS TAKEN TO AVOID EXTREMES
POD0000005252_S0000281 WITH SOME LIQUIDS ALLOWED
POD0000005252_S0000299 HERE WE ENTER THE PENITENTIAL MOTIF WHICH IS PROBABLY WHAT PEOPLE ASSOCIATE MOST STRONGLY WITH CHRISTIAN FASTING
POD0000005252_S0000305 WE TEND TO THINK THAT GOD WILL LOVE US IF WE CHANGE BUT GOD LOVES US SO THAT WE CAN CHANGE
POD0000005252_S0000314 FASTING
POD0000005252_S0000319 SO IF PRAYER FASTING WORKS OF CHARITY AND JUSTICE FORM THE CORE OF CHRISTIAN LIFE AND ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED
POD0000005252_S0000325 ON THE CROSS
POD0000005252_S0000335 ONE REALITY
POD0000005252_S0000342 AS WE'VE NOTED
POD0000005252_S0000347 THE CHALLENGE IS TO HOLD THE PERSONAL AND THE SOCIAL DIMENSIONS TOGETHER
POD0000005252_S0000357 I THINK THE BEST WAY TO BEGIN IN FASTING IS TO EASE INTO IT START BY GIVING UP JUST ONE MEAL BUT DO IT WITH PURPOSE AND INTENTION
POD0000005252_S0000367 THOUGH TO A LESSER EXTENT ON THE OTHER HAND IT WILL ALSO KEEP THE DESIRE FOR FOOD MORE ALIVE THROUGH TASTE OF THE JUICE WHEREAS IN WATER FASTING THE DESIRE FOR FOOD PASSES MORE QUICKLY BOTH ARE GOOD BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT
POD0000005252_S0000377 ONLINE
POD0000005252_S0000385 TAKE TIME TO SIT AND REFLECT
POD0000005252_S0000391 LEARN QUIET SITTING AND MEDITATION
POD0000005252_S0000397 PRAY FOR THE GRACE OF FORGIVING THOSE WHO'VE HURT YOU WE CAN ALSO FAST FROM JUDGING OTHERS
POD0000005252_S0000405 YOU HAVE TO INTEND IT TO BE A SPIRITUAL PRACTICE FOR IT TO BE A SPIRITUAL PRACTICE THAT'S RIGHT
POD0000005252_S0000411 YOU KNOW YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING VERY TRUE SOMETHING VERY DEEP AND UNIVERSAL IN HUMAN EXPERIENCE SO IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T EVER TRIED OR HAVE STOPPED DOING
POD0000005260_S0000040 BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS ABOUT THE CULTURE IN THE SOCIETY RIGHT NOW THAT ARE DRIVING PEOPLE
POD0000005260_S0000112 YOUR MEDICATIONS CAN WORK BUT THERE IS A GREAT MYSTERY ABOUT HOW THEY WORK WHEN THEY WORK WHO THEY WORK FOR WHAT THE DOWNSIDES ARE
POD0000005260_S0000218 I USED TO TAKE A LOT OF BENZODIAZEPINES I'VE NOW TRIED NOT TO
POD0000005268_S0000008 EVEN THOUGH WE LIVE IN A SECULAR WORLD
POD0000005268_S0000015 WE WERE DOING RITUAL IN THAT SPACE
POD0000005268_S0000026 WHICH WAS LITERALLY A RITUAL MEN'S GROUP
POD0000005268_S0000035 THERE'S A CONSTANT MOVE TOWARDS REASON AND DETAIL AND LOGIC
POD0000005268_S0000043 AND WE SEPARATE FROM IT
POD0000005268_S0000048 EMPTY CEREMONIAL
POD0000005268_S0000057 IT NEEDS TO GO DOWN IF YOU LIKE
POD0000005268_S0000073 AND I'M USING THE WORD SOUL HERE AND YOU MAY CHOOSE TO USE THE WORD PSYCHE BRETT
POD0000005268_S0000081 IF I WERE TO TAKE THAT RING OFF MY FINGER IF I WERE TO RITUALLY TAKE IT OFF
POD0000005268_S0000094 ABSOLUTELY
POD0000005268_S0000105 IT'S ABOUT THE SPACE YOU CREATE
POD0000005268_S0000115 AN ORDEAL
POD0000005268_S0000121 YOU CAN DO IT GOING UP AS I SAID IN AN ELEVATOR IF YOU WANT BUT AS LONG AS YOU GO SOMEWHERE DIFFERENT IN THE LANDSCAPE OF YOUR MIND YOU HAVE SEPARATED YOU'VE MADE A CHANGE
POD0000005268_S0000130 THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH
POD0000005268_S0000139 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
POD0000005268_S0000148 IN HIS WISDOM SAW THIS RECURRING AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN IN MYTHOLOGIES AROUND THE WORLD
POD0000005268_S0000157 AND TO RETURN AND TO COME BACK AND THEN TO REENTER SOCIETY
POD0000005268_S0000169 MORE POWERFUL RITUALS
POD0000005268_S0000177 AND THAT'S WHAT GIVES RITUALS ADDED POWER
POD0000005268_S0000193 AND HE BEGAN TO LOOK AT THAT
POD0000005268_S0000204 AND AT THAT POINT
POD0000005268_S0000219 WHICH THEY WERE SHARING WITH US AS MEN
POD0000005268_S0000240 NOW THE REALITY IS
POD0000005268_S0000248 IT'S VERY COMPETITIVE
POD0000005268_S0000262 HE WAS TOTALLY AUTHENTIC
POD0000005268_S0000273 IT'S ABOUT YOUR PSYCHIC READINESS
POD0000005268_S0000279 THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCES HAS GIVEN THEM ENOUGH PAIN AND ENOUGH GRIEF AND ENOUGH DOUBT ABOUT THEMSELVES AS MEN
POD0000005268_S0000299 MEN SEE THAT THEY'RE BUILDING SOMETHING TOGETHER
POD0000005268_S0000307 SOMETIMES IT'S THE EMPATHY AND THE COMPASSION
POD0000005268_S0000314 AND THERE WERE MEN STRANGERS
POD0000005268_S0000321 THE KIND OF STUFF THAT YOU SEE ON A BATTLEFIELD AFTER THE BATTLE
POD0000005268_S0000328 AND TO COME AWAY FEELING A SENSE OF BELONGING AND WHOLENESS AND CONNECTION
POD0000005268_S0000334 WELL IF YOU DON'T SLOUGH OFF THE SKIN YOU CAN'T GROW
POD0000005268_S0000352 YEAH I WANT TO DO THAT NOW
POD0000005268_S0000370 THEY MIGHT BE PRESENT WHEN HE RETURNS FOR THE LAST PART OF THE RITUAL
POD0000005268_S0000376 CREATING THE GROUP OF MEN WHOM YOU CAN ALL TRUST TO INITIATE EACH OTHERS' BOYS THERE'S SOME GREAT WORK BEING DONE THROUGH PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL MEADE
POD0000005268_S0000384 THAT'S WHY I THINK DAD NEEDS TO STEP OUT MOMENTARILY TO GIVE THE BOY HIS CHANCE
POD0000005268_S0000393 THEY NEED TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A MAN
POD0000005268_S0000409 THEY NEED TO BE SEEN TO RISE TO IT
POD0000005268_S0000415 THAT NEEDS TO BE NAMED AND BLESSED AND BROUGHT OUT INTO THE OPEN
POD0000005268_S0000428 WHO BASICALLY RE-BIRTHED ME INTO OLD AGE
POD0000005268_S0000453 BUT I'M NOT SO GOOD AT SITTING ON MY BUTT AND MEDITATING
POD0000005268_S0000467 AND THEN WHEN I WALK AWAY FROM IT IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS
POD0000005268_S0000474 WHO HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED HERE
POD0000005268_S0000486 BUT IT DOES OPEN UP A MORE DIRECT
POD0000005268_S0000500 EXPLORE IT
POD0000005268_S0000514 WELL THERE'S A RITUAL WAY OF COMING OUT OF IT
POD0000005268_S0000526 IT'S SORT OF A RITUAL THERE'S A SPACE YOU GO INTO
POD0000005268_S0000538 YOU TEND NOT TO HIDE
POD0000005268_S0000552 YOU CAN GET IN TOUCH WITH OTHER MEN
POD0000005268_S0000561 HOW THAT HAS CHANGED OUR LIVES
POD0000005276_S0000055 YES
POD0000005276_S0000112 IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH COLOR IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SIZE IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RELIGION
POD0000005276_S0000138 CUT THEM UP INTO SMALL PIECES AND STICK IT INSIDE BLACK TRASH BAGS DON'T STICK THE BIG BOX THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO ISOLATION
POD0000005276_S0000161 BECAUSE AGAIN YOU DO THAT SAME THING YOU SEE THE SIGN AND YOU GO OH MY GOD AND YOU PAT WHEREVER YOUR WALLET HAPPENS TO BE
POD0000005276_S0000197 AND THEY WANT TO GET A LAY OF THE LAND SO THEY HAVE AN IDEA HAVE A PLAN ON WHAT TO DO TO PROTECT THEMSELVES OR THE PEOPLE THEY'RE WITH
POD0000005276_S0000218 WE SIT WITH OUR BACK TO THE WALL SO WE CAN SEE WHO'S COMING IN AND OUT OF THE RESTAURANT
POD0000005276_S0000235 HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE YOU TO PUT A SEATBELT ON
POD0000005276_S0000256 IT GOES BACK TO THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURY
POD0000005276_S0000262 RATHER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO'S NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE ATTACKED HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU YOU GOT A LITTLE GUY MONITORING
POD0000005276_S0000275 DURING THEIR BASIC TRAINING THEY'RE DOING WHAT'S CALLED IMMEDIATE CONTACT DRILLS OR CONTACT RESPONSE DRILLS DEPENDING ON WHICH MILITARY YOU'RE IN
POD0000005276_S0000293 YOU DON'T
POD0000005276_S0000316 WE SET THOSE UP IN MY KRAV SCHOOL ALL THE TIME
POD0000005276_S0000333 DO YOU HAVE THE GIRL IN THE FRONT SEAT THAT YOU MET LAST NIGHT AND THIS IS YOUR FIRST DATE
POD0000005276_S0000368 BECAUSE BY PREVENTING VIOLENCE YOU STAY OUT OF THE LEGAL SPHERE BASICALLY AS SOON AS THERE'S A PUNCH THROWN BY YOU OR THE OTHER PERSON
POD0000005276_S0000428 AND HE GOT CHARGED ARRESTED
POD0000005276_S0000462 ANOTHER ONE IS DON'T USE THE HOTEL SAFE
POD0000005276_S0000484 I JUST WISH THEY'D TURN THAT CREATIVITY TO BUSINESS AND THEY'D BE MULTIBILLIONAIRE DAMN ENTREPRENEURS RIGHT
POD0000005276_S0000498 ANOTHER GOOD TRICK IS TO KNOW YOUR TWENTY FOUR HOUR SAFE HAVENS
POD0000005276_S0000516 ONE OF THE EXERCISES I DO ON THE LIVE COURSE IS WE TAKE THEM OUT INTO THE PARKING LOT
POD0000005284_S0000043 AND SUCCESS
POD0000005284_S0000051 BUT YOUR SUCCESS IS REALLY ABOUT US
POD0000005284_S0000073 WHO WAS JUST AS GOOD AT FIGHTS ACTUALLY AS HIMSELF
POD0000005284_S0000083 SAME WITH THE GREAT GATSBY BY F SCOTT FITZGERALD
POD0000005284_S0000096 THEY WERE REVERED IN THEIR TIMES AND THEY'RE VERY VERY FEW LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE RECOGNIZED AFTER THEIR DEATH
POD0000005284_S0000112 THE FIRST LAW REALLY KIND OF ADDRESSES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERFORMANCE AND SUCCESS
POD0000005284_S0000126 SURE
POD0000005284_S0000134 WHERE YOU CANNOT JUST LOOK AT THE OBJECT FROM IN ISOLATION FROM THE ARTWORK AND DECIDE WHAT IS IT'S WORTH
POD0000005284_S0000148 IF HOWEVER YOU'RE IN AN AREA WHERE PERFORMANCE IS NOT ACCURATELY MEASURABLE OR NOT MEASURABLE AT ALL
POD0000005284_S0000155 SO JUST HANGING AROUND WITH LOTS OF ARTISTS IS NOT THE PATH TO SUCCESS IN THE ARTWORK
POD0000005284_S0000178 HE RUNS AT MOST ONE PERCENT FASTER THAN THE LOSER OF THAT PARTICULAR COMPETITION
POD0000005284_S0000192 BUT IT CAN BE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE
POD0000005284_S0000210 PREVIEW
POD0000005284_S0000230 THAT IS VISIBILITY MEANS THAT I CAN EASILY FIND YOU
POD0000005284_S0000253 IS THAT REALLY THE VOLATILITY IS OFTEN NOT IN THE QUALITY OF THE SONG
POD0000005284_S0000265 OR YOU CAN RANK THINGS BASED ON THE TRUE INNER VALUE OF THAT THAT YOU INFER FROM THESE FORMULAS
POD0000005284_S0000277 WHERE A COLLEAGUE A SOCIOLOGIST FROM HOLLAND HAS GONE AND RANDOMLY PICKED TWO HUNDRED KICK STARTER PROJECTS THAT NO ONE HAS YET SUPPORTED BECAUSE THEY WERE BRAND NEW
POD0000005284_S0000291 THE FIRST PRIZE
POD0000005284_S0000300 WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO SAY WELL
POD0000005284_S0000314 WELL ONCE THE TEAM IS THERE AND THEY HAVE ACHIEVED THE WORK
POD0000005284_S0000328 DECIDED WHO GETS THE REWARD FOR THAT WORK AND NAMELY PRIZES IN A PARTICULAR NOBEL PRIZES
POD0000005284_S0000341 HOWEVER IF YOU AND I WRITE A PAPER ABOUT NETWORK SCIENCE AND LET'S ASSUME THAT YOU COME UP WITH THE IDEA
POD0000005284_S0000358 TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO DO FIRST GO OUT AND SPEAK AT EVERY POSSIBLE VENUE CONFERENCES WORKSHOPS ABOUT THIS WORK
POD0000005284_S0000367 WHEN THE COMMUNITY WOULD LIKE AN EXPERT IN HUMAN MOBILITY NO ONE THINKS OF ME
POD0000005284_S0000379 I HAVE REALLY VERY LIMITED CHANCE OF OVERCOMING MY EARLIER WORK
POD0000005284_S0000390 BUT THEY DO MOST OF THE PUBLISHED WORK RELATIVELY EARLY IN THEIR CAREER
POD0000005284_S0000403 SO AT THE END WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THIS RESEARCH IS THAT NO CREATIVITY HAS NO AGE PRODUCTIVITY DOES PEOPLE DO TEND TO SLOW DOWN
POD0000005284_S0000415 WHICH REALLY SAYS
POD0000005284_S0000422 THAT IS
POD0000005292_S0000014 A NEW PERSPECTIVE A NEW PERCEPTION OF SOMETHING
POD0000005292_S0000024 YOU HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER IT
POD0000005292_S0000043 AND THEY ASKED HIM DID YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR AHA MOMENT THAT LED TO YOUR BREAKTHROUGH
POD0000005292_S0000051 RATHER THAN THE BREAKTHROUGH MOMENTS
POD0000005292_S0000066 PRODUCER NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE
POD0000005292_S0000079 YOU'RE NOT MAKING PROGRESS
POD0000005292_S0000084 AND WE MIGHT CALL THAT DIVERSION
POD0000005292_S0000098 THAT HE WAS THINKING ABOUT TOYS IN FACT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE HE'D BEEN THINKING ABOUT TOYS PRIOR TO THAT AT ALL
POD0000005292_S0000105 HE WASN'T STUCK BECAUSE HE HADN'T BEEN WORKING ON ANYTHING
POD0000005292_S0000119 PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN STUDYING INSIGHT FOR ALMOST A CENTURY
POD0000005292_S0000128 YOU NEED LOTS AND LOTS OF INSIGHTS OR LOTS OF REPETITIONS OF SOMETHING YOU CAN'T JUST DO A BRAIN IMAGING OF A SINGLE INSTANCE OF SOMETHING
POD0000005292_S0000139 DID YOU WORK IT OUT IN A DELIBERATE METHODICAL FASHION
POD0000005292_S0000147 WAS THAT THERE ARE OTHER BRAIN PROCESSES THAT ARE UNCONSCIOUS THAT LED UP TO THIS
POD0000005292_S0000152 SO SOMETIMES
POD0000005292_S0000162 SO WE FOUND THE AHA MOMENT IS THIS BURST OF ACTIVITY IN THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE OF THE BRAIN
POD0000005292_S0000170 SO WHAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN IS THAT THE BRAIN CAN DETECT THAT THERE IS THIS UNCONSCIOUS SOLUTION OR IDEA
POD0000005292_S0000181 WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO SOLVE AN UPCOMING PROBLEM WITH AN INSIGHT
POD0000005292_S0000191 YOU DON'T CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS
POD0000005292_S0000201 THAT'S ANOTHER STEP LEADING TOWARDS INSIGHT AND THEN GOING EVEN FURTHER BACK IN TIME
POD0000005292_S0000212 AND THOSE WHO TEND TO SOLVE THEM ANALYTICALLY AND WE FOUND IS THAT THE ANALYTICAL SOLVERS HAD MORE ACTIVITY IN THE FRONTAL LOBES OF THEIR BRAIN
POD0000005292_S0000222 THEY MAY NOT BE AS ORGANIZED
POD0000005292_S0000230 WHICH WE FOUND WE WERE VERY SURPRISED AT THAT
POD0000005292_S0000245 AND IF YOU HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO IT EITHER WAY
POD0000005292_S0000256 OFTEN TAKE A LEAP OF CREATIVE INSIGHT
POD0000005292_S0000271 BECAUSE THAT WASN'T A PROBLEM HE WAS WORKING ON
POD0000005292_S0000277 THEY WOULD SHOW POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS LIKE SOLUTION WORDS
POD0000005292_S0000282 BUT WHEN THEY SAW THAT WORD ON THE SCREEN
POD0000005292_S0000291 WHEN YOU'RE IN A NEGATIVE MOOD LIKE IF YOU'RE ANXIOUS
POD0000005292_S0000300 CAREFUL FASHION THAT ANXIETY
POD0000005292_S0000306 ANXIETY
POD0000005292_S0000311 ON THE OTHER HAND
POD0000005292_S0000317 YOU CAN TRY OUT CRAZY IDEAS YOU COULD TRY OUT LONG SHOT IDEAS
POD0000005292_S0000330 THE GULCH
POD0000005292_S0000339 AND THE OTHER MEN MUST HAVE THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY OR THAT HE WAS GIVING UP
POD0000005292_S0000345 AND THEN THE FIRE CAME UP AROUND HIM AND PASSED HIM ON BOTH SIDES
POD0000005292_S0000355 ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT MAYBE HE HAD ACCEPTED DEATH
POD0000005292_S0000363 THERE ARE EARLY BIRDS
POD0000005292_S0000369 IF YOU'RE A NIGHT OWL YOU'LL GET YOUR BEST CREATIVE IDEAS IN THE MORNING SO ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT FUZZY THINKING WHEN YOU'RE NOT AS SHARP
POD0000005292_S0000379 YOU'RE EXPANDING YOUR SCOPE OF THOUGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF NOTED CREATIVE FIGURES LIKE TO SPEND TIME WALKING OUTDOORS
POD0000005292_S0000388 AND THAT ENCOURAGES AHA MOMENTS WHEREAS THE COLOR RED
POD0000005292_S0000400 AND IT'S QUIET
POD0000005292_S0000410 AND RIGHT THERE THAT IMPROVED MOOD ENHANCES CREATIVE INSIGHT
POD0000005292_S0000422 AND NAPOLEON SAID
POD0000005292_S0000428 THAT'S COMPLETELY WRONG BECAUSE SLEEP IS NOT JUST REST IT'S NOT A SIGN OF WEAKNESS
POD0000005292_S0000433 AND WORKING ON SOLVING PROBLEMS
POD0000005292_S0000448 HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE LABORATORY
POD0000005292_S0000461 I PUT THOSE ON
POD0000005292_S0000469 IF THEY CAN JUST GET A LITTLE BIT OF TIME WHERE THEIR SMARTPHONE IS TURNED OFF
POD0000005300_S0000014 WHY IS IT THAT WHEN I LIFT A WEIGHT
POD0000005300_S0000027 BUT THEY'RE FAR LESS IMPORTANT THAN WHAT'S CONVENIENT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON
POD0000005300_S0000046 FOR ME
POD0000005300_S0000075 NOW THERE'S ARGUMENTS RIGHT NOW BUT IS THAT REALLY A BIGGER MUSCLES OR IS THAT JUST LIKE MUSCLE DAMAGE CAUSING A LITTLE BIT OF INFLAMMATION
POD0000005300_S0000095 HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR YOU TO GET UNFIT
POD0000005300_S0000112 IF YOU CAN FIND FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET OUT THERE AND HAMMER
POD0000005300_S0000145 THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT THAT'S THE ONE PERCENT THE NINETY NINE PERCENT IS
POD0000005300_S0000174 PEOPLE WHO EXERCISE TEND TO BE MORE ABLE TO AUTOMATICALLY EAT THE AMOUNT THAT THEY NEED
POD0000005300_S0000196 I DON'T THINK IT REALLY MATTERS WHICH CALORIES YOU BURN
POD0000005300_S0000218 I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE SOME INCORRECT WAYS TO RUN
POD0000005300_S0000230 CERTAINLY THERE'S LOTS OF SATISFIED CUSTOMERS OUT THERE WHO ARE LIKE
POD0000005300_S0000251 BEEN IN THE TRASH FOR A LONG TIME
POD0000005300_S0000262 THE WHOLE RUNNING SHOE MARKET HAS CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THAT
POD0000005300_S0000310 WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CORE FROM A FUNCTIONAL POINT OF VIEW IS YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S GIVING YOU STABILITY
POD0000005300_S0000358 THAT LEVELS OF
POD0000005300_S0000386 NOW
POD0000005308_S0000008 WELL I MEAN
POD0000005308_S0000026 THE TOP OF THEIR FIELD MAKING LOTS OF MONEY AND THEY'RE JUST MISERABLE YEAH
POD0000005308_S0000045 SO IF I DECIDE YEAH I'M GOING TO BE A LAWYER OR WHATEVER BUT WHY AM I MAKING THAT CHOICE IS IT BECAUSE I HAVE AN UNCLE THAT'S A LAWYER OR BECAUSE I'M TOLD THAT THIS IS THE SAFE SORT OF PATH AND IT'S RESPECTABLE YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE REALLY INTERESTING SORT OF CAREERS RIGHT NOW
POD0000005308_S0000064 WE JUST STARTED STUDYING PEOPLE WHO WERE INCREDIBLE AT WHAT THEY DO
POD0000005308_S0000074 AND YOU WOULD HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ACTUALLY CONVERT THAT INTO A FULFILLING LIFE AND THEN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION WITH THAT
POD0000005308_S0000092 SHE'S AN INTERNATIONALLY RESPECTED ASTRONOMER WHO HAS DISCOVERED A PLANET
POD0000005308_S0000100 THAT'S WHERE YOU WENT
POD0000005308_S0000126 ACCOMPLISHING THINGS THAT TRULY MATTER TO ME
POD0000005308_S0000148 I MEAN NO KIDDING
POD0000005308_S0000160 SO IT'S SIMPLY LIKE THIS IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT YOU ENJOY DOING RIGHT NOW WHETHER THEY'RE AT WORK WHETHER THEY'RE HOME RECREATION WHATEVER
POD0000005308_S0000174 AND THEY CAN IMAGINE THE WAVE FORM OF THE SOUND
POD0000005308_S0000190 DARK HORSES
POD0000005308_S0000209 IT'S ACTUALLY MAKING YOUR OWN OPTIONS
POD0000005308_S0000227 HOW DO I GET TO THAT PLACE WHERE I CAN LIVE WITH THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND I HAVE A GOOD FIT
POD0000005308_S0000247 IS
POD0000005308_S0000256 AND IT WAS JUST
POD0000005308_S0000278 MEASURABLE
POD0000005308_S0000294 LOOK AROUND AND SAY LOOK AM I MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD THE PEAK OR AM I GOING DOWN
POD0000005308_S0000307 GUESS WHAT IF YOU HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THESE BASIC PRINCIPLES
POD0000005308_S0000330 THE TRUTH IS WHAT WE'RE CHANGING NOW IS THE PURPOSE OF THESE SYSTEMS YOU TAKE SOMETHING LIKE EDUCATION
POD0000005308_S0000338 WE SEEM SHOCKINGLY CONTENT WITH THE STATUS QUO BUT WE SHOULDN'T OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM DOESN'T MATCH OUR CAPABILITIES FOR PERSONALIZATION
POD0000005316_S0000017 A DREAM I MEAN AS AN A NIGHT DREAM
POD0000005316_S0000026 SO IN A SENSE THAT'S A CALLING AS WELL
POD0000005316_S0000034 AND WHAT I REALIZED AFTER HEARING THIS FOR A WEEK WAS
POD0000005316_S0000048 YEAH
POD0000005316_S0000054 BUT THOSE OF US WHO ARE MORE SECULAR ABOUT IT LIKE MYSELF
POD0000005316_S0000061 SO I THINK THIS NOTION OF A CALLING PROBABLY CAN TURN SOME PEOPLE OFF JUST BECAUSE IT'S GOT ALL THESE RELIGIOUS OVERTONES
POD0000005316_S0000074 THAT THIS WAS THE RIGHT ONE FOR YOU
POD0000005316_S0000083 DREAMS
POD0000005316_S0000094 ON THE FRONT DOOR
POD0000005316_S0000099 NASTY DISTURBING UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS MAKE YOU LATE FOR DINNER
POD0000005316_S0000108 AND I JUST TO REMIND ME THAT A CALLING PULLS ME OUT OF TERRA COGNITO INTO TERRA INCOGNITO
POD0000005316_S0000126 IN MY EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS MY OBSERVATION
POD0000005316_S0000136 AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD SOME KIND OF PRACTICE AND THE WHOLE POINT OF IT
POD0000005316_S0000141 A PRACTICE WAS REALLY COMMON
POD0000005316_S0000149 ET CETERA
POD0000005316_S0000160 AND CALLS HAVE A TOUGH TIME GETTING THROUGH WHEN THEY GET NOTHING BUT BUSY SIGNALS
POD0000005316_S0000167 AND CALLS WILL HAVE A TOUGH TIME GETTING THROUGH TO YOU WHEN THEY HIT THAT WALL
POD0000005316_S0000185 WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO RECONFIGURE MY LIFE OR MAKE A COURSE CORRECTION OR SOMETHING
POD0000005316_S0000197 WHERE DOES HEAD ARGUE WITH HEART
POD0000005316_S0000209 HE SAID WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR SOUL REALLY WANTS TURN TO YOUR IMAGES
POD0000005316_S0000217 AND THAT'S ONE WAY OF INVOKING CALLS IS TO GO IS TO ASK FOR THEM
POD0000005316_S0000227 YEAH WOO WOO WELL WHAT IS WOO WOO
POD0000005316_S0000234 THEY'RE DATA
POD0000005316_S0000255 YOU DID WHAT
POD0000005316_S0000264 AND THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A RITE OF PASSAGE THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERY CULTURE AT SOME POINT IN HISTORY HAS COME UP WITH TO SEND ONE OF THEIR INDIVIDUALS
POD0000005316_S0000270 WHICH I JUST LOVE AND THEY DESIGN IT SO THAT THE FIRST FOUR DAYS AS YOU'RE EXPLAINING IT TO THE SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE YOU'RE WITH MAYBE A DOZEN PEOPLE
POD0000005316_S0000275 GET AWAY FROM THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT DEFINE WHO YOU ARE AND GET OUT THERE INTO THE WILDERNESS
POD0000005316_S0000296 BUT SOMETHING ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE OUT THERE IN NATURE AWAY FROM NEW YORK
POD0000005316_S0000303 AND AT ONE POINT I MOVED TO A LITTLE TOWN NORTH OF TAOS NEW MEXICO LITTLE TOWN CALLED ARROYO SECO
POD0000005316_S0000310 LIVING IN THE DESERT THE WHOLE DESERT FATHERS TRADITION
POD0000005316_S0000316 AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU'LL TAKE YOURSELF REALLY OUT OF THE BOX AND GIVE YOURSELF ONE OF THOSE AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT KIND OF EXPERIENCES
POD0000005316_S0000325 AND LIFE OF COURSE IS FULL OF DISTRACTIONS
POD0000005316_S0000338 ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT I INTERVIEWED FOR THE BOOK SAID
POD0000005316_S0000346 IN OTHER WORDS
POD0000005316_S0000359 PEOPLE SAID THEY KNOW
POD0000005316_S0000368 THERE IS SOMETHING SUSPECT
POD0000005316_S0000380 THAT TO ME IS SIGNIFICANT YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ABIDE BY ALL OF THE PRACTICE
POD0000005316_S0000392 WELL FOR ONE THING THEY DON'T GO AWAY
POD0000005316_S0000401 FRANKLY I THINK A LOT OF ILLNESS IS A RESULT OF PEOPLE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE SIGNALS THAT ARE COMING FROM THEIR OWN LIFE
POD0000005316_S0000406 UNTIL THE LAST POSSIBLE MINUTE OF LIFE WELL SOMETHING YOU ALSO POINTED OUT IN THE BOOK IS THAT SOMETIMES REFUSING A CALL MIGHT BE A NECESSARY STEP FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY ACCEPT THE CALL YEAH
POD0000005316_S0000415 SO THAT'S WHAT HE DID HE DID HIS PAINTING ON THE SIDE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS
POD0000005316_S0000424 CALLINGS ARE NOT NECESSARILY ASKING YOU TO FLIP THE WHOLE CIRCUIT
POD0000005316_S0000435 BUT THE FACT IS
POD0000005316_S0000442 DADDY THEY DON'T STOP UNTIL DADDY BENDS DOWN IN AND GIVES THEM ATTENTION
POD0000005316_S0000454 SO THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR LOOKING AT THE IMPACT YOU FOLLOWING YOUR CALLING IS GOING TO HAVE ON YOUR COMMUNITY BUT HERE'S ANOTHER TAKE ON THAT
POD0000005316_S0000463 WHICH YOU CAN JUST GOOGLE
POD0000005316_S0000469 ONLY ASKING QUESTIONS WHICH IS MURDER
POD0000005316_S0000484 YEAH BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS AND ASSUME THAT BECAUSE YOU QUOTE
POD0000005316_S0000494 YOU'RE LIVING SO FAR BELOW YOUR POTENTIAL THAT YOU'RE FAILING ANYWAY
POD0000005316_S0000501 WHICH WAS A REALLY INTERESTING REFRAME
POD0000005316_S0000523 WELL WHERE I IMMEDIATELY GO IS FIND SOME KIND OF SELF REFLECTIVE PRACTICE THAT WORKS FOR YOU
POD0000005324_S0000017 THE PRUSSIANS REALIZED THAT NONE OF THEM WERE EQUAL TO NAPOLEON
POD0000005324_S0000024 WHAT THEY CALLED THE GENERAL STAFF TO LEAD THEIR MILITARY
POD0000005324_S0000035 WHICH IN ENGLISH IS WAR GAMING
POD0000005324_S0000044 AND THE RED CELL IS THE CIA'S RED TEAM
POD0000005324_S0000052 TAKE EVERYTHING THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE TRUE EVERY DAY LOOK AT ALL OF OUR INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENTS AND TRY TO ARGUE THAT THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE TRY TO ARGUE THAT WE'RE WRONG TRY TO POKE HOLES IN WHAT WE HAVE CONCLUDED BASED ON THE INTELLIGENCE THAT WE HAVE
POD0000005324_S0000060 WHAT THE CIA BELIEVES IT MEANS AND WHAT OPTIONS THE PRESIDENT HAS FOR RESPONDING TO THIS BASED ON THE CONCLUSIONS THE CIA HAS DRAWN FROM THIS INTELLIGENCE SO THE ALTERNATIVE INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT WAS A ONE PAGE DOCUMENT SLIPPED IN IN THE BACK OF THAT THAT BOOK EVERY DAY THAT SAID YOU KNOW WHAT
POD0000005324_S0000066 THE CIA STILL PREPARES IT THEY JUST DON'T GIVE IT TO THE PRESIDENT SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ONE THING THAT HAPPENED WITH THE CIA NOW A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER
POD0000005324_S0000073 WE'RE GOING TO SET UP A LESSONS LEARNED TEAM TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS HAPPENED
POD0000005324_S0000079 AND BECAUSE OUR WEAPONS WERE SO SUPERIOR TO ANYONE ELSE'S
POD0000005324_S0000092 HE USED RED TEAMING TECHNIQUES TO COME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF THE SURGE THAT IF WE
POD0000005324_S0000102 IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD THE IDEAS YOU COME UP WITH ARE
POD0000005324_S0000109 BUT THE POINT IS IS IT WAS SO SUCCESSFUL THAT MOST OF THE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT ARE ALLIED WITH THE UNITED STATES HAVE NOW SET UP THEIR OWN RED TEAMING PROGRAMS OR A RED TEAM TRAINING PROGRAMS AND ARE USING THIS KIND OF ACROSS THE WORLD
POD0000005324_S0000117 I DON'T THINK JEFF HAS EVER HEARD OF RED TEAMING BUT WHAT YOU DESCRIBED IS VERY SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO
POD0000005324_S0000132 AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT HERE IN A BIT
POD0000005324_S0000139 IS THAT ADAM SMITH WAS WRONG
POD0000005324_S0000147 THAT'S HOW WE WISH WE MADE DECISIONS BUT THE PEOPLE'S DECISIONS NO MATTER HOW SMART THEY ARE NO MATTER HOW WELL EDUCATED THEY ARE NO MATTER HOW EXPERIENCED THEY ARE NO MATTER HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE
POD0000005324_S0000162 THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FACTORY COST SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND IT'S STILL NOT TURNED TO PROFIT
POD0000005324_S0000181 TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KILL THE AFTERNOON
POD0000005324_S0000189 AND MOM SAYS I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO ABILENE I ONLY SAID WE SHOULD GO TO ABILENE BECAUSE DAD SAID WE SHOULD GO TO ABILENE AND DAD SAYS
POD0000005324_S0000205 IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A COMPLICATED TECHNIQUE BUT SIMPLY PUT
POD0000005324_S0000211 ASSUMPTIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE PLANNING PROCESS
POD0000005324_S0000222 WHICH IS SOMETHING PEOPLE OFTEN DON'T THINK ABOUT
POD0000005324_S0000237 I'M ASSUMING I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET HOME INSURANCE I'M ASSUMING THE MORTGAGE WILL GET APPROVED I'M ASSUMING THAT I'LL HAVE A JOB IN THE FUTURE WHERE I CAN PAY THE MORTGAGE
POD0000005324_S0000244 YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO MAKE A GOOD DECISION BY ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS THAT YOU JUST ASKED THAN IF YOU JUST SAID
POD0000005324_S0000253 IS ANOTHER SET OF EYES THAT LOOKS AT THE PROBLEM THAT LOOKS AT THE DECISION AND HELPS YOU SEE WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE
POD0000005324_S0000270 LITERALLY THE HEAD OF THE TEAM WHO PLANNED THE INVASION OF IRAQ
POD0000005324_S0000283 SO IN REALITY
POD0000005324_S0000291 ON THE UPPER RIGHT-HAND BOX
POD0000005324_S0000296 THEN IN THE LOWER LEFT-HAND QUADRANT
POD0000005324_S0000301 IS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
POD0000005324_S0000313 THAT CAN BE A REAL POWERFUL TECHNIQUE ANOTHER TECHNIQUE YOU HIGHLIGHT IN THE BOOK THAT I'VE USED PERSONALLY IS A PRE-MORTEM ANALYSIS WHAT'S THAT
POD0000005324_S0000324 THE VALUE IN DOING THAT IS IT SHOWS YOU THE THINGS THAT COULD LEAD TO A BAD OUTCOME EARLIER IN THE PROCESS WHILE THERE'S STILL TIME TO AVOID THE BAD OUTCOME
POD0000005324_S0000331 AND YEAH YOU GOT TO HAVE SOME OPTIMISM TO DO THAT BUT IT ALSO HELPS TO THINK ABOUT OKAY
POD0000005324_S0000338 THE POINT OF DOING THIS IS NOT BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU HAVE A LOUSY PLAN AND YOUR PLAN IS GOING TO FAIL
POD0000005324_S0000346 ANOTHER REALLY GOOD QUESTION SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE STRESS AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR SUCCESSFUL RED TEAMING
POD0000005324_S0000356 A CONTRARIAN DOESN'T WANT TO RIP THINGS APART FOR THE SAKE OF RIPPING THINGS APART A CONTRARIAN WANTS TO LOOK AT THINGS FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN EXAMINED FROM EVERY FACET
POD0000005324_S0000362 MAKE THAT PLAN BETTER NOT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SHOWING EVERYONE THAT YOU'RE SMARTER THAN THEM
POD0000005324_S0000369 YOU GUYS FAILED TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE THREE THINGS
POD0000005324_S0000374 LOOKED AT YOUR STRATEGY WE THINK YOU GUYS CAME UP WITH A REALLY GOOD PLAN HERE AT BASE BUT WE SEE SOME KEY AREAS WHERE IT COULD BE MADE EVEN STRONGER
POD0000005324_S0000381 LIKE IT'S JUST MORE INFORMATION FOR YOU LIKE YOU'RE STILL THE LEADER YOU STILL GET TO MAKE THE DECISION ABSOLUTELY
POD0000005324_S0000389 MAYBE THEY'RE NOT VALID MAYBE THEY ARE
POD0000005332_S0000009 AND I REALLY DIDN'T BEGIN TO FORM AS A FULLY FUNCTIONING ADULT UNTIL MY LATE TWENTIES AND THEN WHEN THAT HAPPENED I BEGAN TO BLOOM PRETTY FAST
POD0000005332_S0000021 SO LET'S JUST CALL HIM A LATE BLOOMER
POD0000005332_S0000027 THE GREATEST NFL QUARTERBACK OF ALL TIME TOM BRADY
POD0000005332_S0000034 AND SO NOW HE BECOMES THE MOST FAMOUS QUARTERBACK OF ALL TIME
POD0000005332_S0000039 AND WHEN YOU HIT THAT INTERSECTION YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING PULLED TOWARD YOUR DESTINY AS OPPOSED TO BEING PUSHED BY OTHERS
POD0000005332_S0000061 THE TWO MOST RELIABLY LUCRATIVE FIELDS WHERE YOU COULD MAKE THE MOST MONEY THE QUICKEST WAY POSSIBLE LEGALLY ARE IN STILL TODAY
POD0000005332_S0000073 ALL THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THAT PARENTS DO TO GIVE THEIR KIDS AN EDGE
POD0000005332_S0000092 IN THE EARLY DAYS OF GOOGLE WHEN BRIN AND PAGE WERE STILL INVOLVED WITH RECRUITING PEOPLE
POD0000005332_S0000113 AT AGE SIXTY FOUR WAS THE CEO OF GOOGLE CLOUD
POD0000005332_S0000124 WELL IT TURNS OUT TO BE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT AT CERTAIN THINGS YES
POD0000005332_S0000133 IS THAT POST PEAK WE FALL OFF RAPIDLY LET'S SAY LIKE A PROFESSIONAL SPORTS PLAYER WHO SUDDENLY WHEN THEY FALL THEY FALL RAPIDLY
POD0000005332_S0000151 FRANKLY IT WAS A LOT EASIER TO GET INTO STANFORD THAN IT IS NOW
POD0000005332_S0000174 YOU LOSE YOUR LATERAL VISION YOU LOSE YOUR CURIOSITY
POD0000005332_S0000182 IT GETS HARD TO GET IT BACK NOW
POD0000005332_S0000196 IT WAS CAROL DWECK NOW CAROL DWECK IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE NAME
POD0000005332_S0000211 NOW
POD0000005332_S0000220 THAT'S A FIXED MINDSET
POD0000005332_S0000227 SELF-DOUBT IS GOING TO CREEP BACK IN I LOOK AT SELF-DOUBT LIKE THE WEATHER
POD0000005332_S0000237 SELF-DOUBT IS INFORMATION
POD0000005332_S0000251 OKAY THANKS GO SIT DOWN
POD0000005332_S0000261 RAISING MONEY
POD0000005332_S0000278 BUT HE ADMITTED THAT HE WAS OVERWHELMED HOW DID HE RESPOND TO IT HE SCRIPTED THE FIRST TWENTY PLAYS OF EVERY GAME
POD0000005332_S0000299 WELL RICH WHERE CAN PEOPLE GO TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BOOK AND THE REST OF YOUR WORK
POD0000005340_S0000008 I THOUGHT TOO WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING TO TALK ABOUT SO THE FIRST IS A CHAP CALLED MICHAEL BURRY
POD0000005340_S0000033 BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO SHOW STATUS
POD0000005340_S0000055 YET THE FACT THAT THEY WERE FAMOUS THEY HAD NOTORIETY
POD0000005340_S0000066 WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR THERE IS SOME SORT OF EVIDENCE OF WHERE DO YOU SIT ON THAT SOCIAL HIERARCHY COMPARED TO ME
POD0000005340_S0000087 THEY'LL PUT AN ACTOR WHO'S NOT A DOCTOR IN A WHITE COAT AND YOU WENT OH YEAH I BELIEVE THIS GUY BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A DOCTOR YEAH IN FACT
POD0000005340_S0000105 THEY BECOME EVEN MORE EXPERT IN THE EYES OF THE AUDIENCE
POD0000005340_S0000119 HOW DO YOU PROMOTE YOURSELF WITHOUT TURNING PEOPLE OFF
POD0000005340_S0000152 YEAH I THINK
POD0000005340_S0000175 BECOME MORE CONNECTED
POD0000005340_S0000198 I'M TRYING TO GET ALONG WITH YOU
POD0000005340_S0000216 I NEED HELP
POD0000005340_S0000235 NO ONE EVER TOOK THE MONEY
POD0000005340_S0000259 THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES LOOKING AT TED TALKS FOR EXAMPLE AND WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE A SERIES OF PRESENTERS AT TED
POD0000005340_S0000275 I CAN FOLLOW THIS PERSON
POD0000005348_S0000020 ACROSS WHAT'S NOW IRAQ AND IRAN
POD0000005348_S0000034 SORT OF THE BACKWOODS THE BACK COUNTRY BUT SOMEHOW IT MANAGED TO RISE TO POWER SO
POD0000005348_S0000045 BUT THEY WERE A POWERFUL KINGDOM BUT THEY REALLY UNTIL THE TIME OF PHILIP
POD0000005348_S0000054 WITH THE AIM ULTIMATELY AS HE ALWAYS SAID
POD0000005348_S0000068 WAS A GREAT PELOPONNESIAN WAR BETWEEN ATHENS AND SPARTA
POD0000005348_S0000105 BUT I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE AND THEN ALSO IS HE HAD A UNIQUE EDUCATION BECAUSE HIS PERSONAL TUTOR WAS THE GREAT PHILOSOPHER THE PHILOSOPHER THE TEACHER
POD0000005348_S0000138 WHO HE COULD LEAVE THE THRONE TO
POD0000005348_S0000161 WAS IT JUST AN ANGRY JILTED FORMER LOVER OF PHILIP
POD0000005348_S0000174 BUT THROUGH MATTERS OF PERSUASION
POD0000005348_S0000181 WHICH WAS A GREAT TRAINING SESSION FOR HIS INVASION OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE
POD0000005348_S0000198 THE SPARTANS REALLY HAD NEVER BEEN SERIOUSLY DEFEATED IN BATTLE
POD0000005348_S0000213 AND THE REST WOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE REBELLING WHILE HE WAS OFF IN PERSIA
POD0000005348_S0000229 THAT THEY WOULD USE TO POKE AND STAB THEIR ENEMY
POD0000005348_S0000246 RIGHT THE GREEK CITIES ON THE WESTERN COAST OF WHAT'S NOW TURKEY
POD0000005348_S0000272 BUT I THINK AFTER ALEXANDER TOOK THE GREEK CITIES OF ASIA MINOR
POD0000005348_S0000300 AND THERE'S THIS ISLAND
POD0000005348_S0000313 HE HAD TO TAKE TYRE HE HAD TO FIND SOME WAY TO SUBDUE THIS ISLAND CITY
POD0000005348_S0000332 AND HE WENT THERE THOUGH TO CONSULT THE ORACLE AND WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HE WENT INTO THE ORACLE'S TEMPLE
POD0000005348_S0000339 THAT HE WAS THE SON OF A GOD
POD0000005348_S0000357 JULIUS CAESAR WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THESE ALEXANDER WAS ONE OF THEM NAPOLEON WAS ONE OF THEM CERTAINLY RELIGIOUS LEADERS MUHAMMAD JESUS
POD0000005348_S0000369 AND HE ALSO KEPT A CONSTANT FLOW OF CORRESPONDENCE
POD0000005348_S0000393 ONE OF WHICH EVENTUALLY KILLED HIM
POD0000005348_S0000405 WE WANT TO GO HOME THIS IS FAR ENOUGH
POD0000005348_S0000416 AND MOST OF THEM MADE IT
POD0000005348_S0000431 AND EVENTUALLY HAD A YOUNG SON
POD0000005348_S0000438 TO THE STRONGEST
POD0000005348_S0000457 ALL THE WAY TO AFGHANISTAN AND INDIA
POD0000005348_S0000471 ALEXANDER SPREAD CIVILIZATION REALLY GREEK CIVILIZATION AT LEAST
POD0000005348_S0000494 ALWAYS TAKING CARE OF HIS MEN BEFORE HIMSELF
POD0000005356_S0000017 AND YOU FEEL MORE LIKELY TO MAKE YOUR NEXT SHOT
POD0000005356_S0000029 REALLY
POD0000005356_S0000034 AND THE STUDIO EXECUTIVE SAYS
POD0000005356_S0000047 THESE RESEARCHERS BELIEVE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE BOTHERED TO LOOK FOR IT SO THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THIS PAPER A COUPLE YEARS AGO
POD0000005356_S0000068 WELL CLEARLY THAT THEY'RE POWERFUL SO THE THING ABOUT THAT GAME IS THAT IT WAS MADE BY THIS BRILLIANT VIDEO GAME DESIGNER NAMED MARK TURMELL
POD0000005356_S0000088 AND THEY LOOKED AT THE CHRONOLOGY OF SHOTS THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE TAKEN
POD0000005356_S0000102 WE STILL DO SEE PATTERNS IN RANDOMNESS FOR ONE THING
POD0000005356_S0000121 HE HAS AGENCY OVER HIS OWN SITUATION
POD0000005356_S0000130 IN GAMBLING IT'S WHEN YOU WALK INTO A CASINO YOU WALK OVER TO A ROULETTE WHEEL
POD0000005356_S0000135 AND WHEN WE THINK WE'RE IN CONTROL WE HAVE THE HOT HAND
POD0000005356_S0000152 IF YOU'RE THE SHOOTER YOU WANT TO SHOOT MORE YOU ARE TAKING CRAZIER SHOTS LONGER SHOTS RISKIER SHOTS
POD0000005356_S0000165 SO WHAT DID TVERSKY MISS THAT THESE GUYS SAW
POD0000005364_S0000009 AND ITS GROWTH RATES SLOW DOWN IT STOPS THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE
POD0000005364_S0000036 I THINK WESTERN CIVILIZATION HAS COME THROUGH THE THIRTY YEARS SINCE THE COLD WAR ENDED
POD0000005364_S0000053 WORKING A FACTORY JOB NOT GOING TO COLLEGE AND THEN HERE I AM LADEN WITH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF STUDENT DEBT WORKING A NOT A GREAT JOB
POD0000005364_S0000080 WE'VE GOT SLACK TIKTOK WHATEVER

POD0000005364_S0000149 THE MARVEL MOVIES THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
POD0000005364_S0000174 AND THEN
POD0000005364_S0000184 WILD WEST PERIOD OF REAL ENTREPRENEURIALISM
POD0000005364_S0000212 AND SOME OF THIS REFLECTS
POD0000005364_S0000253 IT'S THIS SORT OF SOFT PILLOW
POD0000005372_S0000032 EVEN TOASTED BREAD OR MY FAVORITE MAKING BEER
POD0000005372_S0000049 I LOVE THOSE FOR FOLKS THAT ARE WANTING TO HAVE REALLY PRECISE TEMPERATURE CONTROL KIND OF A SET IT AND FORGET IT AND GET THAT GOOD WOOD FLAVOR
POD0000005372_S0000069 IS WHAT I WOULD REFER TO AS A CLOSED SET UP AND THE IDEA IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A LID
POD0000005372_S0000089 YEAH AND SO VENTS AND DAMPENERS KIND OF ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE IN THAT SCENARIO IF YOU'RE READING INSTRUCTIONS

POD0000005396_S0000036 QUESTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANSWERS AND THAT SORT OF THINKING IS THE PREMISE TO THE BOOK BECAUSE IT'S BUILT ON QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE APPLIED IN ANY LEADERSHIP SITUATION ONE FACES
POD0000005396_S0000049 I THINK THEY'RE MANY PEOPLE WHO'RE NOT YET KNOWN IN A PUBLIC WAY WHO'RE BEGINNING TO APPLY THESE THINGS AND AS THEY GO PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE
POD0000005396_S0000065 THAT'S RIGHT
POD0000005396_S0000072 HOW IT'S VALUED IN A GIVEN TIME TO SOME EXTENT
POD0000005396_S0000089 THE TWO MOST CONSEQUENTIAL PRESIDENTS OF TWENTIETH CENTURY I THINK REAGAN OFFERS A NUMBER OF LESSONS
POD0000005396_S0000104 GOLDWATER AND THE CAMPAIGN WENT THROUGH A RECORD DEFEAT

POD0000005404_S0000329 OKAY
POD0000005404_S0000352 TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ATTRACTS WOMEN
POD0000005404_S0000387 SO A LARGE PART OF IT WAS
POD0000005404_S0000403 YOU KNOW NO SURPRISE THERE BUT LIFTING HEAVY IS GOOD FOR TESTOSTERONE AND MAKES YOU FEEL STRONG AND CONFIDENT AFTERWARDS
POD0000005404_S0000411 WE DON'T HAVE TO LET IT BECOME VIOLENCE IN THE WAY THAT IT DID BEFORE
POD0000005412_S0000007 WE THINK THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT HAS THE MAKINGS OF A DEBATE SO LET'S HAVE IT
POD0000005412_S0000019 AND I'M DRAWN TO THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US
POD0000005412_S0000044 BUT SECOND POINT WHEN WE GO TO ACCESS THE INTERNET
POD0000005412_S0000052 NET NEUTRALITY REIGNED
POD0000005412_S0000058 FIRST SERVE NONDISCRIMINATORY ACCESS
POD0000005412_S0000068 AND THE COURT SAID YOU'RE RIGHT AND OVERRULED THE FCC
POD0000005412_S0000088 BECAUSE THE OPEN INTERNET RULING THAT TOM PUT INTO PLACE WAS IN PLACE FOR TWO YEARS WE HAD TIME BEFORE IT DURING IT AND AFTER IT
POD0000005412_S0000098 WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ATTACH DEVICES TO THE NETWORK
POD0000005412_S0000109 WE'RE NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHETHER YOU'RE RIGHT OR WRONG
POD0000005412_S0000114 VOTE AGAINST NET NEUTRALITY IF YOU BELIEVE IN FREE SPEECH INNOVATION
POD0000005412_S0000127 BUT IT'S SLOW
POD0000005412_S0000141 MAYBE IT WANTS DATA
POD0000005412_S0000149 YOU'LL START TO SEE A LOT OF CONTENT THAT'S GOOD FOR COMCAST
POD0000005412_S0000161 SUPPORT NET NEUTRALITY ALL DATA IS CREATED EQUAL
POD0000005412_S0000174 MYTH NUMBER ONE IS IT'S NECESSARY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE THERE
POD0000005412_S0000183 GOOGLE FACEBOOK AMAZON THEY SPEND LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BUILT PRIVATE FAST LANES
POD0000005412_S0000190 WOLFENSTEIN IS A MULTIPLAYER GAME THAT INVOLVES TRYING TO KILL NAZIS WITH SUPERNATURAL POWERS THE NAZIS HAVE THE SUPERNATURAL POWERS NOT YOU
POD0000005412_S0000196 WELL FRANKLY NET NEUTRALITY IS THE THREAT TO FREE SPEECH
POD0000005412_S0000206 YOU'LL SEE THAT IT HARMS COMPETITION
POD0000005412_S0000226 WE HAVE HAD AN OPEN INTERNET RULE IN PLACE
POD0000005412_S0000235 ALL RIGHT
POD0000005412_S0000252 WE HAVE ANTI-TRUST LAWS
POD0000005412_S0000261 IS THE QUESTION OF TRANSMITTING INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS GETS ALL MIXED UP WITH THE PLATFORMS THAT SIT ON TOP
POD0000005412_S0000273 BUT IF I DON'T LIKE THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE BY MY INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER
POD0000005412_S0000292 AND IF YOU LOOK AT PLACES LIKE CHICAGO NEW YORK
POD0000005412_S0000319 FOR FREE TO YOUR WIRELESS DEVICE
POD0000005412_S0000341 MY NAME IS AUGUST HUTCHINSON INTERLOPER FROM UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO

POD0000005412_S0000381 WHO IN A RECENT POLL SAID THEY SUPPORT NET NEUTRALITY AND OPPOSE ITS REPEAL
POD0000005412_S0000395 SO IF YOU WERE ON T-MOBILE AND YOU HAD BINGE ON
POD0000005412_S0000410 OUR GOAL IS NOT MAXIMIZING REVENUE
POD0000005412_S0000416 WE WERE OPEN SOURCE
POD0000005412_S0000423 WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU WOULD EVER THINK IN TRYING TO GET A PRODUCT ADOPTED
POD0000005412_S0000432 THANK YOU
POD0000005412_S0000445 BUT HERE'S THE THING
POD0000005420_S0000009 OUR DEBATE WILL GO IN THREE ROUNDS AND THEN OUR AUDIENCE HERE AT THE MAYO CLINIC'S ANNUAL TRANSFORM CONFERENCE IN ROCHESTER MINNESOTA
POD0000005420_S0000021 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ONCE AGAIN RAJAIE BATNIJI
POD0000005420_S0000039 IT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO GET INFORMED AND WE NEED TO GET ACTIVE
POD0000005420_S0000060 WITH INNOVATION TECH AND CONSUMER PRODUCT COMPANIES ARE CREATING AMAZING DEVICES WEARABLES
POD0000005420_S0000072 NOT WASHINGTON
POD0000005420_S0000087 NOW TAKE WAL-MART I SPENT SOME TIME WITH THEM IN BENTONVILLE ARKANSAS
POD0000005420_S0000105 NOBODY KNEW HEALTH CARE COULD BE SO COMPLICATED
POD0000005420_S0000111 WASHINGTON RESPONDS MORE TO THE INTERESTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES BIG HEALTH INSURERS AND HOSPITAL SYSTEMS THAN IT DOES ALL OF US WHO ARE ACCESSING CARE
POD0000005420_S0000118 PAYING FOR THAT FANCY NEW WING
POD0000005420_S0000127 OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS
POD0000005420_S0000140 IT'S THE DELIVERY DRIVERS WHO BRING AMAZON'S PACKAGES TO YOUR DOOR AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GIG ECONOMY WHICH HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST GROWING SEGMENTS IN OUR ECONOMY
POD0000005420_S0000149 TO IMPROVE THOSE QUALITY MEASURES WE REALLY NEED TO INVEST OUTSIDE OF HEALTH CARE INTO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH
POD0000005420_S0000163 WE HAVE TWO DEBATERS ARGUING IN SUPPORT OF THIS MOTION
POD0000005420_S0000184 I HOPE BOTH AS A CONSUMER AND A PHYSICIAN
POD0000005420_S0000212 SOMEHOW THERE HAS TO BE SOME MONEY FOR THE TRANSACTION
POD0000005420_S0000235 SIXTY PERCENT OF PURCHASES ARE MADE THROUGH A DEMAND AGGREGATION PLATFORM ONLINE FROM A RETAIL PERSPECTIVE AND WE'RE BUILDING THOSE THINGS TO TRY TO DRIVE SIMILAR DISRUPTION
POD0000005420_S0000261 BUT I REALLY SEE WAL-MART AS A PRETTY BIG CORPORATION CYCLING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THROUGH ITS DOORS EVERY DAY I'M HARD PRESSED TO SEE A TRUE COMMUNITY THERE
POD0000005420_S0000276 WHILE SHE'S IN SHE GOES TO THE PHARMACY SHE REFILLS A SCRIPT SHE BUYS SOME INSULIN STRIPS
POD0000005420_S0000290 RETAILERS WILL CONTINUE TO UP THE GAME FOR CONVENIENT CARE
POD0000005420_S0000302 I SEE THE URGENCY OF FIXING OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN EVERY PATIENT THAT I TREAT
POD0000005420_S0000311 MY FAMILY AND THE GOVERNMENT DID
POD0000005420_S0000320 SHE WAS A VERY PROUD WOMAN
POD0000005420_S0000329 WHY WOULDN'T WE WANT TO HAVE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION MORE ELOISE'S
POD0000005428_S0000007 AS ALWAYS OUR DEBATE WILL GO IN THREE ROUNDS AND THEN OUR AUDIENCE HERE AT THE KAYE PLAYHOUSE AT HUNTER COLLEGE IN NEW YORK CITY WILL CHOOSE THE WINNER AND AS ALWAYS IF ALL GOES WELL CIVIL DISCOURSE WILL ALSO WIN
POD0000005428_S0000025 AFTER THE JUMP
POD0000005428_S0000035 AND THEN AS SOON AS THEY GET TO THE GENERAL THEY DO THE FAMOUS PIVOT
POD0000005428_S0000052 ALL OF YOU HAVE A PROFOUND STAKE IN THE OUTCOME OF TONIGHT'S DEBATE
POD0000005428_S0000057 WILL IT BE THE PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN TEDDY ROOSEVELT RONALD REAGAN GEORGE H W BUSH
POD0000005428_S0000062 AND THE IMPORTANCE OF MORAL CHARACTER IN OUR LEADERS
POD0000005428_S0000068 CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT THE SO-CALLED DEEP STATE
POD0000005428_S0000075 AS YOU EVALUATE THAT CLAIM
POD0000005428_S0000083 KRIS AND LIZ WOULD WIN IT HANDS DOWN
POD0000005428_S0000091 AND WOULD ANY REPUBLICAN EVER SEEK TO QUESTION THE COURAGE
POD0000005428_S0000097 AND THE PARTY THAT STOOD FOR COURAGE AND OPTIMISM INTO THE PARTY OF FEAR
POD0000005428_S0000109 HAS DAUGHTERS ON THE WAY TO HARVARD
POD0000005428_S0000115 SUCCESS IS WHAT HAS DRIVEN THIS COUNTRY
POD0000005428_S0000121 THAT'S AN AMAZING NUMBER WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE BELIEVES IN THAT AND THAT THEY ALL HAVE THEIR SHOT
POD0000005428_S0000130 ASSAD HIT WITH CRUISE MISSILES TROOPS TO AFGHANISTAN ARMS FOR UKRAINE A TOUGHER APPROACH TO NORTH KOREA
POD0000005428_S0000137 THEY'RE ANGRY BECAUSE FOR TWO YEARS A FALSE RUSSIAN NARRATIVE HUNG OVER THE WHITE HOUSE
POD0000005428_S0000152 IT CAME AT A GREAT TIME
POD0000005428_S0000163 FAST-FORWARD TO TODAY
POD0000005428_S0000171 WE MEAN A LOT TO THE WORLD
POD0000005428_S0000176 THEY'RE RIGHT HE CAN
POD0000005428_S0000181 SHOULD WE GO ANOTHER FOUR YEARS
POD0000005428_S0000196 THAT'S HOW CLOSE IT WAS AND THAT IS THE ONLY PATH TO VICTORY FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
POD0000005428_S0000215 THEY LOOKED BACK TO RONALD REAGAN AT THE SAME POINT
POD0000005428_S0000239 APPOINTING CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES
POD0000005428_S0000246 WILL VANISH WHEN THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION INEVITABLY COMES TO POWER
POD0000005428_S0000251 MY MOM IS A REFUGEE TO THIS COUNTRY
POD0000005428_S0000258 ONE OUT OF THREE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS WHO ARE AMERICANS WOULD NEVER HAVE MADE IT HERE
POD0000005428_S0000274 TARIFFS ARE ALSO TAXES
POD0000005428_S0000286 ARE TWO TO THREE TIMES HIGHER ON AVERAGE THAN OUR TARIFFS ON THOSE
POD0000005428_S0000311 IT WORKED
POD0000005428_S0000320 IN CONGRESS ANYMORE
POD0000005428_S0000327 LOOK AT THE LONG TERM
POD0000005428_S0000351 HE IS THE MOST OPEN PRESIDENT WE HAVE EVER SEEN AND SO
POD0000005428_S0000387 HE REALLY KNEW HOW TO GET THINGS DONE
POD0000005428_S0000411 I THINK YOU GO FAST FORWARD FOUR YEARS OR DURING THE NEXT FOUR YEARS UNDER A DEMOCRAT WHICH CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES ARE GOING TO DO WELL UNDER THAT CIRCUMSTANCE
POD0000005428_S0000421 AND
POD0000005428_S0000427 OH BOY
POD0000005428_S0000432 FOR NOT LIKING THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE
POD0000005428_S0000442 A LOT OF MY FRIENDS SAID HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP
POD0000005428_S0000447 ALONG WITH HER DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES
POD0000005428_S0000453 PARENTS GET THIS THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S A TREMENDOUS DISPARITY
POD0000005428_S0000469 AND WE REMINISCED AND TALKED ABOUT THE KIND OF MAN HE WAS
POD0000005428_S0000476 THE PARTY THAT WILL BE THE CUSTODIAN OF THOSE IDEALS AT HOME AND THEIR CHAMPIONS ABROAD
POD0000005428_S0000482 IT CAN'T BE IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WANTS TO BE RELEVANT IN THE FUTURE
POD0000005428_S0000495 MEANS MORE PEOPLE WATCH THE DEBATES
POD0000005428_S0000507 EIGHTEEN PERCENT WERE UNDECIDED
POD0000005436_S0000028 THE MOTION IS ABOUT THE RELATIVE IMPACT OF NATURE AND NURTURE
POD0000005436_S0000035 THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND ILLNESS
POD0000005436_S0000045 THE IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS OPERATE IN A RATHER MYSTERIOUS WAY THEY MAKE TWO CHILDREN IN THE SAME FAMILY WITH THE SAME PARENTS DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER
POD0000005436_S0000051 IDIOSYNCRATIC
POD0000005436_S0000061 BUT GENETICS PREDICTS IT
POD0000005436_S0000071 PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR AT UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS
POD0000005436_S0000077 I LOVE THIS MOVIE FOR LOTS OF REASONS BUT ONE OF THEM IS BECAUSE I THINK IT GETS AT A QUESTION THAT A LOT OF US ASK OURSELVES WHICH IS THE QUESTION OF WHAT IF
POD0000005436_S0000087 WHAT ARE THE WHAT IFS THAT ARE BEING MISSED
POD0000005436_S0000097 THIS IS PART OF PARENTING
POD0000005436_S0000103 JUST LIKE A FISH CAN'T RECOGNIZE THE WATER THAT IT SWIMS IN
POD0000005436_S0000109 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING IT WITHIN ANOTHER FAMILY IN THE UPPER EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN WHERE WE ARE TONIGHT
POD0000005436_S0000117 FROM YOUR RACE FROM YOUR SOCIAL CLASS FROM YOUR RELIGION
POD0000005436_S0000133 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MISCONCEPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE
POD0000005436_S0000141 BUT THEY ALSO TEND TO READ TO THEIR CHILDREN
POD0000005436_S0000152 BUT GENES ONLY EXPLAIN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE VARIATION
POD0000005436_S0000158 YOU WILL NOT SEE A GENETIC EFFECT
POD0000005436_S0000165 SCORES OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN LITTLE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THEM IN MOST BEHAVIORS
POD0000005436_S0000178 IN THIS CASE IT WAS TODDLER GIRLS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE MOTHERS AND THEY WERE ASKED A HOST OF DEVELOPMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GIRLS
POD0000005436_S0000186 NOW OUR OPPONENTS ARGUE
POD0000005436_S0000194 IN FACT THERE'S AN IMPRESSIVE AND LONG HISTORY
POD0000005436_S0000206 FORBES ESTIMATED THE MARKET FOR MILLENNIAL MOTHERS STANDS AT FORTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS TODAY
POD0000005436_S0000218 IT TAKES AN ENVIRONMENT TO
POD0000005436_S0000246 YEAH WELL I THINK THERE WAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT QUESTIONS THERE REALLY
POD0000005436_S0000252 IN UNRELATED SAMPLES
POD0000005436_S0000281 AND THIS IS ONLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS
POD0000005436_S0000300 AND PARENTING IS ONLY ONE PART OF THAT
POD0000005436_S0000329 THE OTHER BIG FACTOR IS THE CHILD'S PEER GROUP
POD0000005436_S0000344 CAN WE REALLY DISENTANGLE THIS INTERCONNECTED WEB OF PEOPLE
POD0000005436_S0000355 ROBERT PLOMIN
POD0000005436_S0000368 SO THIS SPARKED OUR RELATIONSHIP WHICH LED TO A TRUE MARRIAGE OF NATURE AND NURTURE
POD0000005436_S0000379 AND THE WHOLE NIGHT I HAD ONE THOUGHT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
POD0000005436_S0000385 HEALTH CARE IS A SYSTEM AND IT'S A SYSTEMATIC FORCE FOR PEOPLE'S LIVES
POD0000005436_S0000396 THEY DISCOVERED THEY WERE THE LOVERS OF THE SAME BOOKS
POD0000005436_S0000402 AND THEIR FATHER SAID TO ME
POD0000005436_S0000408 ONE OF THE TRIPLETS ROBERT SAID TO US
POD0000005436_S0000414 IF WE CHALLENGED YOU TO THINK MORE DEEPLY ABOUT THAT CONCEPT
POD0000005436_S0000422 BUT TONIGHT YOU HAVE HEARD THE FLIP SIDE OF THE BLAME GAME COIN
POD0000005436_S0000429 IN FACT WHY SHOULD WE INVEST IN ANY SOCIAL PROGRAMS THAT HELP MAKE PARENTS' LIVES A LITTLE EASIER IF WHAT THEY DO REALLY DOESN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE
POD0000005436_S0000436 JUST TRY TELLING THAT TO ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM WHO HAS HAD TO SOOTHE FEED DIAPER DRESS BATHE ENTERTAIN CONSOLE COACH DISCIPLINE DEFEND THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF THEIR CHILDREN
POD0000005436_S0000450 THANKS SO MUCH
POD0000005444_S0000025 NOW ARGUING AGAINST THE RESOLUTION WE HAVE TWO DEBATERS AS USUAL AGAIN THE RESOLUTION IS
POD0000005444_S0000035 AND OUR FOURTH DEBATER AGAIN WILL BE SPEAKING AGAINST THE RESOLUTION
POD0000005444_S0000043 OUR DEBATE WILL GO IN THREE ROUNDS
POD0000005444_S0000050 SO POLITICAL LEADERS ACROSS THE WORLD TODAY ARE EVOKING AN EXCLUSIONARY NATIONALISM ASSOCIATED WITH DISCRIMINATION DIVISION AND DESTRUCTION
POD0000005444_S0000059 THE ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA LED BY NELSON MANDELA ALL DRIVEN BY NATIONALISM
POD0000005444_S0000068 A HEALTHY DRIVE FOR NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS HAS DRIVEN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE ARTS
POD0000005444_S0000075 YOU'LL NOT ONLY GIVE UP ON THE IMMENSE CONSTRUCTIVE POTENTIAL OF NATIONALISM YOU DO SOMETHING FAR MORE DANGEROUS
POD0000005444_S0000082 AND AS MUCH AS I LOVE LANGUAGE LITERATURE AND STORIES
POD0000005444_S0000088 CAUSES FAR MORE DAMAGE AND HURT THAN GOOD
POD0000005444_S0000099 THAT DOESN'T MEAN MUCH BECAUSE ON THE STREETS OUT THERE NATIONALISM IS AN UNTAMED FORCE
POD0000005444_S0000107 COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY
POD0000005444_S0000113 THAT XENOPHOBIA IS NOT ACCIDENTAL BUT INTRINSIC TO NATIONALISM
POD0000005444_S0000119 WE HAVE MASSIVE CHALLENGES AHEAD AND THESE ARE GLOBAL CHALLENGES
POD0000005444_S0000124 OUR LIVES OUR DESTINIES ARE INTERCONNECTED
POD0000005444_S0000139 IN THE AMERICAN CASE THAT VERSION WAS LAID OUT BY THE AMERICAN FOUNDERS IN THEIR DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
POD0000005444_S0000145 IMPLICITLY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
POD0000005444_S0000152 MY LAST POINT IS THIS WHEN IT COMES TO AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY
POD0000005444_S0000160 MY OPPONENT JUST SUGGESTED THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF NATIONALISM
POD0000005444_S0000168 SO LET'S REMEMBER WHAT THE MOTION IS NATIONALISM IS A FORCE FOR GOOD
POD0000005444_S0000183 NOW OUR OPPONENTS SUGGEST THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BRITISH NATIONALISM AND CHINESE NATIONALISM PERHAPS IN A SENSE THERE IS BUT IN ANOTHER SENSE THERE ISN'T
POD0000005444_S0000194 FROM TIME TO TIME HAS DONE SOME GOOD BUT THAT ON THE WHOLE AND ALMOST INEVITABLY
POD0000005444_S0000200 DOES IT INEXTRICABLY LEAD TO XENOPHOBIA
POD0000005444_S0000219 PATRIOTISM IS MUCH OLDER NATIONALISM IS MUCH YOUNGER
POD0000005444_S0000225 FIRST OF ALL IT IS MUCH YOUNGER
POD0000005444_S0000237 SO WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO ALL OF THAT
POD0000005444_S0000247 BRITISH NATIONALISM AND EVEN RUSSIAN NATIONALISM
POD0000005444_S0000256 AND THE ACCUSATION AGAINST ME WAS THAT I WAS A TRAITOR THAT I DID NOT LOVE MY NATION
POD0000005444_S0000264 VERY WELL
POD0000005444_S0000277 CAN THERE BE A NATION STATE WITHOUT NATIONALISM
POD0000005444_S0000288 WHEN THERE'S A VERSION THEY DON'T LIKE SO THAT'S CANADA FOR EXAMPLE IS FINE WE'RE FINE WITH CANADA IT'S HARMLESS IT'S TAME IT'S LIBERAL
POD0000005444_S0000297 THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION
POD0000005444_S0000306 HE'S OPPOSED TO THE VERY IDEA OF THE E U BECAUSE IT SOMEHOW OFFENDS HIS ENGLISHNESS
POD0000005444_S0000318 WE WILL SEE AGAIN THE EXCLUSION OF THE MINORITIES WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY AND AGAIN HISTORY HAS GIVEN US SO MANY EXAMPLES THAT PROVES THIS
POD0000005444_S0000335 HOW WOULD THEY EXPLAIN BRAZIL
POD0000005444_S0000352 I'VE NOTICED THAT THERE'S A LIVELY DEBATE GOING ON IN THE UNITED STATES THESE DAYS OVER CONFEDERATE STATUES AND YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT
POD0000005444_S0000358 THAT IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF NATIONALISM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S INCLUSIVE
POD0000005444_S0000363 SO THANK GOD THAT LINCOLN
POD0000005444_S0000369 THEN YOU MUST AGREE THAT NATIONALISM IS A FORCE FOR GOOD
POD0000005444_S0000378 HE SAID TO PUTIN AND THIS WAS HIS WAY OF WARMING UP PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT CHARACTERS LIKE PUTIN
POD0000005444_S0000384 AND I LOVE THAT BECAUSE IT REALLY REITERATES THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE TODAY BETWEEN YESTERDAYS AND TOMORROWS
POD0000005444_S0000392 IT'S NOT A FORCE FOR GOOD
POD0000005444_S0000405 WHAT THIS DOES IS THAT IT ESSENTIALLY LEAVES A POWERFUL DYNAMO ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF RIGHT-WING POPULIST LEADERS WHO DEFINE NATIONALISM IN AN ETHNIC MAJORITARIAN WAY
POD0000005444_S0000418 IT DIVIDES
POD0000005444_S0000424 ATTACKING AND BEATING STUDENTS AND TEACHERS VIOLENTLY
POD0000005444_S0000431 A LABOR MP JO COX WAS HORRIBLY MURDERED ON THE STREETS BY AN ENGLISH NATIONALIST
POD0000005444_S0000439 AND IT IS GETTING LONGER AND LONGER
POD0000005444_S0000444 SO PEOPLE WHO ARE CRITICAL OF NATIONALISTS AND PEOPLE LIKE ANDREW AND ME
POD0000005452_S0000011 CITIZENS UNITED GETS MOST OF THE CREDIT FOR THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SUPER PACS BUT WITHOUT SPEECHNOW
POD0000005452_S0000028 AMERICANS FOR A BETTER TOMORROW TOMORROW
POD0000005452_S0000038 SO HOW DOES THAT WORK
POD0000005452_S0000047 DAVID KEATING
POD0000005452_S0000056 YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ALL THAT
POD0000005452_S0000062 I LIVED UNDER THIS WORKING AT A POLITICAL COMMITTEE I SAW THE REGULATIONS FIRSTHAND
POD0000005452_S0000068 THERE WAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH IT
POD0000005452_S0000077 WE DON'T COORDINATE OUR SPEECH WITH THE CANDIDATES
POD0000005452_S0000082 WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
POD0000005452_S0000092 HE IS ALSO THE LAWYER BEHIND THE CREATION OF STEPHEN COLBERT'S PAC AMERICANS FOR A BETTER TOMORROW TOMORROW
POD0000005452_S0000101 AND MARK HANNA HAD WHAT WE WOULD CALL SUPER PAC MONEY
POD0000005452_S0000106 LATER HE SAID
POD0000005452_S0000115 THAT BRINGS US TO THE WORLD OF SUPER PACS
POD0000005452_S0000120 CORPORATIONS HAD THE SAME RIGHT AS INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE UNLIMITED INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS BECAUSE SUCH SPENDING DOES NOT GIVE RISE TO CORRUPTION OR THE APPEARANCE OF CORRUPTION
POD0000005452_S0000134 SO I'M TALKING INSTEAD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN WRITING ABOUT CIVIL LIBERTIES ISSUES FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW
POD0000005452_S0000147 NOW WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON
POD0000005452_S0000161 THE PEOPLE WHO WIN TEND TO SPEND MORE
POD0000005452_S0000167 NAME RECOGNITION
POD0000005452_S0000188 THAT IF SOMEBODY SHOWED UP AND SAID I'M GOING TO SPEND A BILLION DOLLARS
POD0000005452_S0000197 AT LEAST IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
POD0000005452_S0000207 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE YOUR POLITICAL MONEY TO A SUPER PAC
POD0000005452_S0000216 BUT THE ANSWER TO THE CURRENT LAWLESSNESS IS BETTER RULES NOT LESS OF THEM
POD0000005452_S0000245 I WOULD SAY WE'RE AT THE EARLY STAGES THIS IS KIND OF LIKE THE YEAR AFTER THEY INVENTED TELEVISION WE'RE LOOKING AT TELEVISION ADS RIGHT
POD0000005452_S0000269 SO TO FOCUS ON CONGRESS SHALL PASS NO LAW
POD0000005452_S0000297 I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS A PARTICULAR BENEFIT TO ANYBODY THAT ALL THE SIDES WERE ARMORED UP SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THEY NORMALLY WOULD BE IN A PRIMARY YOU'RE RIGHT
POD0000005452_S0000315 DO I TRUST THIS PERSON TAKING THESE KINDS OF MONEY FROM THESE KINDS OF PEOPLE SO I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE
POD0000005452_S0000330 BUT THERE'S ALSO REAL QUESTIONS OF HOW YOU DESIGN SUCH A SYSTEM SO THAT IT'S ATTRACTIVE SO THE CANDIDATES WILL EVEN WANT TO DO IT
POD0000005452_S0000338 IT'S NOT POPULAR PEOPLE DON'T LIKE PAYING TAXES
POD0000005452_S0000351 AND YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE APPEARANCE BECAUSE IF CITIZENS THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON
POD0000005452_S0000364 IMAGINE THEY FORMED A GROUP CALLED SAY
POD0000005452_S0000370 BUT INSTEAD SCHEDULED MEETINGS WITH LEGISLATORS AND SCREENED THE ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THEM IN PRIVATE
POD0000005452_S0000377 UNDISCLOSED MONEY AT THEIR DISPOSAL
POD0000005452_S0000385 SO DURING THE FIRST ROUND OF ARGUMENTS IN CITIZENS UNITED
POD0000005452_S0000392 SAID THE GOVERNMENT HAD CHANGED ITS ANSWER
POD0000005452_S0000408 THEY GAVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE PRO-ROMNEY SUPER PAC RESTORE OUR FUTURE
POD0000005452_S0000423 THAT'S A CONFLICT
POD0000005452_S0000431 I WOULD SAY FREE SPEECH IS MESSY
POD0000005452_S0000441 AFTER THE DEBATE TWENTY TWO PERCENT ARE FOR THE MOTION THAT'S UP THREE PERCENT
POD0000005460_S0000013 BY BUYING UP TO A COSTLIER PLAN ALL YOU'RE DOING IS LOWERING YOUR CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES
POD0000005460_S0000020 BUT AT BEST FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WILL GET OBAMACARE COVERAGE THIS YEAR AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE CLOSER TO FOUR MILLION
POD0000005460_S0000029 OBAMACARE IS REALLY A MEDICAID LAW
POD0000005460_S0000039 AT THAT TIME WE HAD FORTY TO FORTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE UNINSURED
POD0000005460_S0000050 FAMILY HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS GOING UP FROM THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO AVERAGE THIRTY THOUSAND A YEAR MEDICARE TRUST FUND RUNS OUT OF MONEY
POD0000005460_S0000057 YOUNG ADULTS TWENTY SIX AND UNDER NOW CAN GET COVERAGE ON THEIR PARENTS' POLICIES AND THREE MILLION HAVE
POD0000005460_S0000072 AND COST INCREASES CONTINUE TO MODERATE
POD0000005460_S0000078 IF YOU COULDN'T AFFORD HEALTH CARE INSURANCE AND GOT REALLY SICK YOU WENT BANKRUPT PLAIN AND SIMPLE
POD0000005460_S0000087 YOU HAVE HEARD TWO OF THE OPENING STATEMENTS
POD0000005460_S0000105 AND WE WANTED EXPANDED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE RIGHT
POD0000005460_S0000120 HE IS A DAILY COLUMNIST FOR NEW YORKMAGAZINE HE'S AUTHOR OF THE BOOK THE BIG CON CRACKPOT ECONOMICS AND THE FLEECING OF AMERICA LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
POD0000005460_S0000125 EVERY DAY I WENT THROUGH BROUGHT FRESH MISERY AND FRESH REASON TO THINK WHY AM I DOING THIS
POD0000005460_S0000163 AND YOU END UP WITH REGULATIONS THAT PRESCRIBE EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE AND DON'T HAVE TO HAVE
POD0000005460_S0000213 OBAMACARE IS NOW BEYOND RESCUE
POD0000005460_S0000227 I THINK WE PROBABLY CAN LEARN A LOT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES
POD0000005460_S0000257 AND THE FUTURE YOU IS GOING TO BE MUCH OLDER
POD0000005460_S0000271 WHAT'S COME BEFORE
POD0000005460_S0000283 THEY WERE POOR
POD0000005460_S0000299 NETWORKS AND DRUG FORMULATORS WILL HAVE TO BE NARROWED FURTHER NEXT YEAR AS THIS WHOLE MARKET GETS REPRICED OFF THE SECOND CHEAPEST PLAN IN EVERY STATE
POD0000005460_S0000313 THANK YOU JONATHAN CHAIT
POD0000005460_S0000334 SO
POD0000005468_S0000011 WORKING WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT
POD0000005468_S0000026 WHERE YOU STOOD ON THIS ISSUE WHEN YOU WROTE A PIECE BACK THEN THAT SAID LET THEM HAVE NUKES
POD0000005468_S0000039 JUST A SHORT PREVIEW OF YOUR ARGUMENT HERE
POD0000005468_S0000057 ON THE IRAN QUESTION I THINK HE'S ACTUALLY SINCERE WHAT THAT MEANS FOR POLICY I DON'T KNOW BUT HE IS VERY SINCERELY GRIPPED BY THIS ISSUE
POD0000005468_S0000076 AND WE'LL GO BACK TO THE MIDDLE AGES
POD0000005468_S0000098 THAT IS ISRAEL
POD0000005468_S0000115 A NUCLEAR ARMS RACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST
POD0000005468_S0000127 I'M JOHN DONVAN WE HAVE FOUR DEBATERS TWO AGAINST TWO
POD0000005468_S0000134 WELL JUST TO REMIND US WHAT WE'RE DEBATING ABOUT THE PROPOSITION IS CAN ISRAEL LIVE WITH A NUCLEAR IRAN CAN ISRAEL SURVIVE A NUCLEAR IRAN
POD0000005468_S0000141 NOT IF THEY CAN HELP IT
POD0000005468_S0000152 ONE HAS TO GO BACK TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS IT THAT WE AND FOR THAT MATTER MOST ISRAELIS
POD0000005468_S0000163 BUT IT'S FAR FROM A CERTAINTY IT'S NOT THE HISTORIC PATTERN
POD0000005468_S0000175 HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF STUDIES AT THE INSTITUTE OF POLICY AND STRATEGY IN HERZLIYA
POD0000005468_S0000186 NOW
POD0000005468_S0000209 NUKES COULD REACH TERRORISTS' HANDS AND BOTTOM LINE
POD0000005468_S0000226 HAMAS FIRES ROCKETS INTO ISRAEL
POD0000005468_S0000239 BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T THE REAL ISSUE HERE
POD0000005468_S0000251 TO INCLUDE THE WEST BANK
POD0000005468_S0000264 WHICH IT'S LOST WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA
POD0000005468_S0000270 WHICH WOULD CAUSE THEM TO USE THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS
POD0000005468_S0000299 I WOULD SAY WHAT'S DIFFERENT AND WHAT YOU'RE ARGUING CLEARLY IS THAT THE NEW INGREDIENT IS VIRULENT POLITICAL ISLAMISM
POD0000005468_S0000310 THEY'RE PROMOTING SUBVERSION
POD0000005468_S0000334 NOT ONLY NORTH KOREA AND PLACES LIKE THAT WHERE PEOPLE MAY THINK ONE THING AND THE REGIME IS SOMETHING ELSE
POD0000005468_S0000353 AND WE ARE ABOUT TO MOVE ON TO ROUND THREE WHICH WILL BE BRIEF CLOSING STATEMENTS FROM EACH DEBATER IN TURN
POD0000005468_S0000366 SAYS IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
POD0000005468_S0000384 A SENIOR MILITARY AFFAIRS ANALYST WITH HAARETZ
POD0000005468_S0000408 NOW THE LEVEL OF HOSTILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST DOES NOT AUGUR WELL FOR DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN NOT EVEN NOT ONLY ISRAEL-IRAN
POD0000005468_S0000425 WAS IRAN THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE NO
POD0000005468_S0000431 WAS IRAN THE NUMBER THREE CONCERN NO
POD0000005468_S0000441 BEFORE THE DEBATE IN POLLING YOU IN THE LIVE AUDIENCE
POD0000005476_S0000007 WHICH IS A CLEAR HARM TO THEM
POD0000005476_S0000015 I'M JOHN DONVAN WE HAVE FOUR SUPERBLY QUALIFIED DEBATERS AMERICANS ALL
POD0000005476_S0000030 YOU WERE NEW YORK CITY'S POLICE DEPARTMENT'S DEPUTY COMMISSIONER FOR COUNTERTERRORISM BOTH JOBS TOUGH PLACES TOUGH TIMES BUT WHICH IS THE HARDER PLACE TO LIVE IN NEW YORK OR WASHINGTON
POD0000005476_S0000056 SO THESE PROGRAMS REALLY DO MATTER
POD0000005476_S0000068 HEALTH CARE OR TAXATION OR ENTITLEMENT REFORM OR WHAT TO DO IN THE MIDDLE EAST
POD0000005476_S0000074 AND THEY ARE UNCHANGED
POD0000005476_S0000086 AND UNLESS YOU'RE A TERRORIST OR A CRIMINAL YOU SHOULD ALSO VOTE NO
POD0000005476_S0000093 NOT MASS SURVEILLANCE
POD0000005476_S0000100 BECAUSE THEY FORCED ME TO FOCUS ON THE RIGHT PEOPLE FOR THE RIGHT REASONS
POD0000005476_S0000109 IT PHOTOCOPIES EVERY PIECE OF DOMESTIC MAIL
POD0000005476_S0000124 THERE'S JUST SO MUCH INFORMATION HOW DO I KNOW WHICH OF THREE THOUSAND CABLES TO PAY ATTENTION TO
POD0000005476_S0000137 AND NOT SURPRISINGLY DIDN'T CHECK IN VERY CAREFULLY AND HE GOT RIGHT PAST THEM
POD0000005476_S0000154 FIVE HUNDRED NUMBERS CAME OUT AS POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS
POD0000005476_S0000166 YOUR OLD GIRLFRIEND
POD0000005476_S0000175 WITH THE GOVERNMENT DEMANDING TRANSPARENCY FROM US BUT INSISTING ON SECRECY WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAMS THAT IT EMPLOYS
POD0000005476_S0000198 COURT ENFORCED
POD0000005476_S0000219 THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOW TURNED AROUND AND PERVERTED IN SECRET
POD0000005476_S0000229 THIS DATA FOR VERY GOOD REASONS
POD0000005476_S0000236 MORE INFORMATION ISN'T NECESSARILY BETTER
POD0000005476_S0000285 SO MY QUESTION IS
POD0000005476_S0000308 TO CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE HERE
POD0000005476_S0000328 THANK YOU MICHAEL GERMAN
POD0000005476_S0000343 THANK YOU RICHARD FALKENRATH
POD0000005476_S0000356 THEY'RE COLLECTING DATA ON EVERY TEXT THAT I SEND TO MY HIGH SCHOOL DAUGHTER WHEN I GO TO PICK HER UP FROM SCHOOL AND SHE HASN'T COME OUT AND I SAY WHERE ARE YOU I'M HERE WHERE ARE YOU I'M HERE WHERE ARE YOU I'M HERE
POD0000005476_S0000378 OUR MOTION IS THIS SPY ON ME I WOULD RATHER BE SAFE
POD0000005476_S0000384 THEY WERE FORTY ONE PERCENT TO START
POD0000005485_S0000010 ONE OF NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY'S MOST TRANSFORMATIVE LEADERS PRESIDENT EMERITUS HENRY BIENEN
POD0000005485_S0000027 EVEN AFTER INFLATION IT'S GONE UP BY THREE HUNDRED PERCENT COSTS ABOUT FOUR TIMES AS MUCH
POD0000005485_S0000042 AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW WELL PEOPLE ARE DOING WHO COME OUT OF COLLEGE
POD0000005485_S0000055 WHERE CAN THEY GO TO GET A REFUND PETER THIEL YOUR TIME IS UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH
POD0000005485_S0000065 BECAUSE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER TOO MANY KIDS GO TO COLLEGE IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT WHAT KIND OF A SOCIETY WE HOPE TO CREATE
POD0000005485_S0000072 THE ARGUMENT THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COLLEGE IS NOT NEW
POD0000005485_S0000078 WHICH SHOULD PERSUADE ANYONE WITH AN OPEN MIND THAT MORE YEARS OF SCHOOL
POD0000005485_S0000087 NOT JUST INDIVIDUAL
POD0000005485_S0000093 ABOUT SIXTY SIX PERCENT OF THE UNITED STATES POPULATION BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY HAD SOME COLLEGE EXPERIENCE
POD0000005485_S0000099 HE BELIEVES I THINK THAT ABILITIES ARE FIXED
POD0000005485_S0000109 THAT IS COLLEGE MAY PAY OFF FOR SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE SMARTER PEOPLE GO TO IT
POD0000005485_S0000118 IT SKYROCKETED IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY S AND NINETEEN NINETY S
POD0000005485_S0000132 ALMOST EVERYBODY NEEDS MORE EDUCATION AFTER HIGH SCHOOL
POD0000005485_S0000141 YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T REPRESENT THAT ANY MORE
POD0000005485_S0000149 NOW
POD0000005485_S0000172 YOU KNOW IT MUST BE BECAUSE
POD0000005485_S0000182 EVERYONE IS TRYING TO BE LIKE US
POD0000005485_S0000191 NOW
POD0000005485_S0000213 HE TOOK A CALLIGRAPHY COURSE
POD0000005485_S0000226 NOT HAVING A COLLEGE DEGREE HAD NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE AMERICAN DREAM AT ALL AT THAT TIME
POD0000005485_S0000233 THE CASTE SYSTEM IS REAL
POD0000005485_S0000255 YOU WANT TO FIND GOOD SKILLED LABOR
POD0000005485_S0000273 HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE LEFT IN COLLEGE WHAT PERCENTAGE
POD0000005485_S0000283 I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT
POD0000005485_S0000302 ANGEL INVESTMENTS SO I'D LIKE FOR BOTH SIDES TO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY OF THE SOCIAL NETWORKS THAT YOU GET WHILE YOU'RE IN UNIVERSITY PETER THIEL
POD0000005485_S0000327 LET ME REPEAT I DO NOT SEE OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES HAVING FEWER PEOPLE ON THEM
POD0000005485_S0000350 AND YOU'LL EARN MORE MONEY THAN IF YOU NEVER WENT
POD0000005485_S0000363 IS ALSO SUFFICIENT FOR SOCIETY TODAY
POD0000005485_S0000372 A COLLEGE DEGREE A NECESSITY TO SHOW THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT WAS ONCE CALLED A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE
POD0000005485_S0000385 AND I AGREE WITH WHAT PETER SAID AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE THAT IT WOULD BE A PERVERSE EFFECT TO SAY OKAY COLLEGE IS GOING TO BE REMEDIAL FOR THE LOUSY HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION THAT THEY GOT THE ANSWER TO THAT
POD0000005485_S0000399 BUYER BEWARE
POD0000005485_S0000411 SO I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND MY TWO MINUTES ON THAT I WANT TO ACTUALLY CHALLENGE MY NEW FRIEND PETER THIEL ON SOMETHING WHICH IS VERY DEAR TO HIS HEART
POD0000005485_S0000420 WE CAN CHANGE THE ENTIRE CONCEPT OF EDUCATION
POD0000005485_S0000430 THANK YOU VIVEK WADHWA
POD0000005485_S0000437 WE WILL HAVE A SYSTEM UTTERLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE WE HAVE NOW AND IT WILL NOT BE COLLEGE AS WE KNOW IT
POD0000005485_S0000446 MOVING TO CERTIFICATIONS
POD0000005485_S0000452 WE BECOME JOURNEYMAN
POD0000005485_S0000459 AGAINST IS FORTY SIX PERCENT THAT'S UP SIX PERCENT
POD0000005493_S0000017 BECAUSE THEN AGAIN IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETY S
POD0000005493_S0000027 TO BECOME THE DOMINANT AUTHORITY FOR THE INTERNET
POD0000005493_S0000044 WE MADE OUR CASE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HE SAID I WILL TAKE IT UNDER REVIEW
POD0000005493_S0000052 I'M TALKING ABOUT DESTRUCTION OF DATA
POD0000005493_S0000074 AND I ALSO IN PREPARING
POD0000005493_S0000097 AND AS WE HAVE THIS DEBATE
POD0000005493_S0000114 BRUCE SAYS VOTE FOR US IF YOU THINK JOURNALISTS AND THEIR HEADLINE WRITERS AND SOMETIMES THEIR SOURCES EXAGGERATE
POD0000005493_S0000121 NEITHER EXAGGERATING NOR UNDERSTATING IT SO WHAT KIND OF THREAT AM I TALKING ABOUT LET ME JUST GIVE YOU TWO QUICK EXAMPLES
POD0000005493_S0000138 THAT WANTS TO TRY TO TAKE DOWN THE NET
POD0000005493_S0000152 REGISTERED YOUR STANCE ON THIS MOTION BEFORE THE DEBATE BEGAN HERE ARE THE NUMBERS
POD0000005493_S0000188 YOU KNOW OVERRUN ITS LAND
POD0000005493_S0000206 BUT ACTUALLY MOST OF THE WORLD WORKS PRETTY WELL PRETTY MUCH ALL THE TIME
POD0000005493_S0000220 YOU HAVE TWO WEEKS AND YOU HAVE TO WREAK MAXIMUM HAVOC AMONG THE DEVICES IN CONSUMER LAND THE PEOPLE YOU JUST TOLD SHOULD FEEL SAFE IN THEIR HOMES AND BUSINESSES
POD0000005493_S0000263 IT'S ABOUT A DEBATE THAT CAUSES US TO INVEST THE RESOURCES AND TRAIN OUR PEOPLE SO THAT WE CAN SECURELY RELY ON SOMETHING WE HAVE BECOME DEPENDENT ON
POD0000005493_S0000283 MR SCHNEIER BROUGHT UP RECOVERY AND I THINK THIS IS A KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REAL WAR AND SO-CALLED CYBER WAR
POD0000005493_S0000290 IT'S LIKE WELL THAT DOES NOT MAKE ME SLEEP ANY BETTER AT NIGHT
POD0000005493_S0000299 JUST TO TAKE THAT STEP IN THIS AREA WE THINK IN THE LONG TERM WOULD PROVIDE GREAT BENEFIT FOR CYBER SECURITY
POD0000005493_S0000308 SO IF YOU FEEL SUPPORTIVE OF THAT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR THAT SIDE BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE REMEDY NOT ABOUT THE PROBLEM
POD0000005493_S0000329 SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT EXPENSIVE SOLUTIONS AT LEAST WHEN I TALK TO THE BANKING COMMUNITY
POD0000005493_S0000346 YES OKAY
POD0000005493_S0000358 FIFTY FOUR PERCENT DISAGREED AND TWENTY TWO PERCENT WERE UNDECIDED YOU WILL BE ASKED TO VOTE ONCE AGAIN IN JUST A FEW MINUTES
POD0000005493_S0000367 DIGITAL MONEY
POD0000005493_S0000373 I SUPPORT DETERRENCE THAT'S WHAT THIS DEBATE IS ALL ABOUT WHAT IS IT WE HAVE TO DO TO BE ABLE TO DETER OTHER NATION STATES FROM ENGAGING IN WAR OR ENGAGING IN CYBER WAR
POD0000005493_S0000380 THAT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES THAT FLOW FROM HOW YOU JUDGE THE PROPOSITION TONIGHT
POD0000005493_S0000389 AND I'M GOING TO URGE YOU ALONG WITH THE REST OF YOU
POD0000005493_S0000404 LIFE IS GOOD
POD0000005493_S0000423 SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS I URGE YOU TO VOTE THAT THE THREAT OF CYBER WAR HAS BEEN GROSSLY EXAGGERATED
POD0000005501_S0000009 AND THE TEAM THAT MOVES THE MOST VOTERS THAT CHANGES THE MOST MINDS
POD0000005501_S0000021 AND IT BEGAN A MASSIVE PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE REGION
POD0000005501_S0000029 BECAUSE THE SOURCES ALSO STARTED FLEEING OFFSHORE
POD0000005501_S0000038 WELL HERE'S THE SIMPLE REALITY
POD0000005501_S0000050 AS UNITED STATES CITIZENS TO REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR DRUGS IN OUR COUNTRY
POD0000005501_S0000058 DRUG CONSUMPTION IS NOT UNIQUE TO THE UNITED STATES
POD0000005501_S0000066 MEXICO HAS RESISTED US HELP
POD0000005501_S0000074 MEXICO BELIEVED THAT WE WERE INFRINGING UPON THEIR SOVEREIGNTY
POD0000005501_S0000083 WE FEAR EXTRADITION
POD0000005501_S0000094 THE REASON THERE ARE DRUG WARS IS BECAUSE THE DRUG TRADE IS PROHIBITED
POD0000005501_S0000101 THE SECOND THING TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT THE US
POD0000005501_S0000117 IT'S ALSO A DELIBERATE DIVERSION AWAY FROM THE ISSUES THAT REALLY MATTER
POD0000005501_S0000124 WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY THEY'RE BUYING WHOEVER THEY WANT WHATEVER THEY WANT WHEREVER IT IS NO MATTER WHAT IT COSTS
POD0000005501_S0000130 BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU THE ONE PLACE IT DOESN'T COME FROM
POD0000005501_S0000137 MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SOLDIERS HAVE DESERTED THE MEXICAN ARMY
POD0000005501_S0000144 MEXICO'S FORMER DRUG CZAR
POD0000005501_S0000155 AMERICA IS TO BLAME FOR MEXICO'S DRUG WAR
POD0000005501_S0000170 UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW
POD0000005501_S0000175 WHAT'S A LITTLE EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW BETWEEN FRIENDS
POD0000005501_S0000182 IT IS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO A NATION THAT SHARES A TWO THOUSAND MILE BORDER WITH THE RICHEST NATION ON EARTH WHEN THAT RICHEST NATION ON EARTH INSISTS ON CONSUMING SOME SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DRUGS A YEAR
POD0000005501_S0000188 BUT THE REAL CURSE ISN'T MERELY PROXIMITY TO AMERICA
POD0000005501_S0000194 SAYING THAT AS THE ULTIMATE CONSUMERS OF THE DRUGS FLOWING NORTH WE HAVE A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY WITH MEXICO IN CONFRONTING ITS WAR
POD0000005501_S0000204 MY POINT IS VERY SIMPLE HERE
POD0000005501_S0000209 IT WAS STARTED ON FALSE PREMISES
POD0000005501_S0000217 THAT STATE CAPACITY IN MEXICO HAS NEVER BEEN IMMENSE
POD0000005501_S0000223 BECAUSE HIS ELECTION WAS QUESTIONED
POD0000005501_S0000229 THROUGH THE WAR ON DRUGS
POD0000005501_S0000236 AND WE CAN PURSUE A POLICY IN THE UNITED STATES MEXICANS WE MEXICANS
POD0000005501_S0000244 THERE ARE MORE PUBLIC LEGAL DISPENSARIES OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA THAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS
POD0000005501_S0000252 AND IT'S A WAR THAT WE SHOULD CALL OFF PROMPTLY
POD0000005501_S0000262 OUR MOTION IS AMERICA IS TO BLAME FOR MEXICO'S DRUG WAR
POD0000005501_S0000267 ON NOW TO ROUND TWO OF THIS INTELLIGENCE SQUARED US DEBATE IT'S OUR MIDDLE ROUND
POD0000005501_S0000287 AMERICA IS NOT TO BLAME
POD0000005501_S0000297 STRATEGY
POD0000005501_S0000304 UNQUESTIONABLY THE MAGNITUDE OF RESOURCES WE DEVOTE TO PROHIBITION IS GROTESQUELY EXCESSIVE
POD0000005501_S0000317 THAT OUR CURRENT APPROACH
POD0000005501_S0000328 IS THERE SOMETHING THAT THE US CAN DO
POD0000005501_S0000336 THE MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS WOULD STILL BE ARMED TO THE TEETH
POD0000005501_S0000345 WHO ALSO SAID IT'S A FAILED WAR
POD0000005501_S0000356 AND YOU PROHIBIT IT A WHOLE BUNCH OF CONSEQUENCES HAPPEN
POD0000005501_S0000361 OKAY HE'S OPPOSED TO STRENUOUS GUN LAWS TO PROHIBITING GUNS BUT EXACTLY THE SAME ARGUMENTS
POD0000005501_S0000384 AND ONCE THEY DID THAT GUESS WHAT HAPPENED THE USAGE WENT UP
POD0000005501_S0000396 WE ARE THE ONES WITH AN ADDICTION RATE OF ILLICIT DRUGS THAT'S SIX TIMES HIGHER THAN IN MEXICO
POD0000005501_S0000403 AND I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED IMMIGRATION BECAUSE YOU SAY WELL THEY'RE DIVERSIFYING INTO HUMAN TRAFFICKING
POD0000005501_S0000423 AND SECONDLY STRANGELY ENOUGH
POD0000005501_S0000433 HOW WOULD THESE DRUG CARTELS PAY FOR THIS ORGANIZATION
POD0000005501_S0000457 AND SO EVERY COUNTRY IS MAKING DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN
POD0000005501_S0000479 YOU AMERICANS LOOK AT THINGS VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO
POD0000005501_S0000488 AND FOR THAT REASON I AM GOING TO HAVE INTRUSIVE DRUG TESTING
POD0000005501_S0000500 PASSIONATELY
POD0000005501_S0000509 I THINK MR HUTCHINSON HAS A FAIR POINT
POD0000005501_S0000514 IN PRINCIPLE COULD THEY DO THAT ON THEIR OWN YES
POD0000005501_S0000523 SO THERE IS CERTAINLY A VALID POINT THERE AS WELL
POD0000005501_S0000535 AND ON THE GUN QUESTION I ALSO THINK THAT THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
POD0000005501_S0000549 AMERICA IS TO BLAME FOR MEXICO'S DRUG WAR BEFORE THE DEBATE FORTY THREE PERCENT OF YOU WERE FOR THE MOTION TWENTY TWO PERCENT OF YOU WERE AGAINST AND THIRTY FIVE PERCENT WERE UNDECIDED
POD0000005509_S0000008 HE'S A FORMER U S DIPLOMAT HE SERVED AS A SPECIAL DEPUTY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE U N
POD0000005509_S0000017 AND WE DID NOT SUCCEED
POD0000005509_S0000026 LARRY KORB AND I SUPPORT THE INTERVENTION IN LIBYA
POD0000005509_S0000033 IRAN
POD0000005509_S0000041 IN AFGHANISTAN
POD0000005509_S0000048 YES
POD0000005509_S0000057 GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A SON WHO HAS DONE TWO TOURS IN IRAQ NONE OF THIS IS THEORETICAL FOR YOU IS IT
POD0000005509_S0000068 AND WHAT WILL BE THE CONSEQUENCES WHEN WE DO SO
POD0000005509_S0000076 IN MANY WAYS WE'VE ENTERED A WORLD WHICH IS A DANGEROUS AND DIFFICULT PLACE
POD0000005509_S0000084 ARMS A MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT WHICH ACTS IN SUPPORT OF A FOREIGN POLICY THAT CLAIMS AMONG OTHER THINGS TERRITORIAL RIGHTS TO THE SOUTH AND EAST CHINA SEAS
POD0000005509_S0000092 TO EXERCISE LEADERSHIP THAT ONLY THE UNITED STATES CAN LEAD
POD0000005509_S0000101 THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT NOW WE'RE BROKE
POD0000005509_S0000107 HERE WE ARE TODAY WE ACCOUNT FOR ONLY ONE QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
POD0000005509_S0000116 AND WE DIDN'T PAY FOR IT IN FACT WHAT WE DID IS WE CUT TAXES
POD0000005509_S0000124 AND HE SAYS UNLESS WE GET OUR ECONOMIC HOUSE IN ORDER AT HOME WE CAN'T BE STRONG ABROAD
POD0000005509_S0000147 YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THERE WILL BE NO WAR ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA
POD0000005509_S0000155 TAKE A LOOK AT ASIA TODAY IT'S AN INTERESTING THING
POD0000005509_S0000162 THIS PORT SHOULD BE A FUEL STOP FOR AIRCRAFT CARRIERS WELL THEY DON'T HAVE ANY AIRCRAFT CARRIERS
POD0000005509_S0000168 THE DEFENSE BUDGET HAS BEEN FALLING AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP FOR DECADES IT'S FALLING UNDER FOUR PERCENT NOW IT IS SCHEDULED IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO GO UNDER THREE PERCENT
POD0000005509_S0000174 DOESN'T WORK
POD0000005509_S0000179 WHO BENEFITS IF THERE ARE MORE SREBRENICAS AND DARFURS AND RWANDAS THE ANSWER IS PEOPLE LIKE GADDAFI AND MILOSEVIC AND BASHAR AL-ASSAD AND SADDAM HUSSEIN
POD0000005509_S0000185 THANK YOU
POD0000005509_S0000194 SO WE SHOULDN'T
POD0000005509_S0000223 BUT PETER IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE SUPPORTED THE WAR FOR THE RIGHT REASONS I MEAN MORALLY
POD0000005509_S0000230 IT ISN'T LOST NOW
POD0000005509_S0000254 IT DOESN'T COST TOO MUCH
POD0000005509_S0000277 YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT COMMITTING AMERICAN TROOPS YOU'RE COMMITTING AMERICAN PRESTIGE AND MONEY
POD0000005509_S0000292 FOUND OUT WE EVEN WHEN OUR ECONOMY WAS MUCH BETTER WE STILL COULD NOT ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE THAT WE WANTED
POD0000005509_S0000311 I THINK WHEN WE INTERVENE
POD0000005509_S0000330 I ALSO KNOW THAT NONE OF THESE DECISIONS ARE EASY THEY DON'T GET TO THAT LEVEL IF THEY WERE EASY
POD0000005509_S0000341 WE HAD THE UNITED STATES AND WE WERE ENFOLDED WITHIN ITS WINGS
POD0000005509_S0000356 AND THE JAPANESE ARE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY QUITE FEARFUL ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A CHINESE GRAB FOR THOSE ISLANDS
POD0000005509_S0000372 WHICH IS THAT WE'VE HAD THIS GO-IT-ALONE POLICY IN THE WORLD
POD0000005509_S0000389 AND IF WE EXPAND OUR GLOBAL WINGS
POD0000005509_S0000396 AND THAT WILL HELP I MEAN PETER WAS TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE AMERICAN OPINION AROUND THE WORLD HAS GONE UP
POD0000005509_S0000404 AND THE MORE WE LIVE UP TO THAT THE MORE THEY'RE GOING TO HATE US BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN IT SO THAT IS NOT A SOLUTION
POD0000005509_S0000415 BUT LET ME OFFER ONE WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT AND ONE WAY OF FORMULATING YOUR JUDGMENTS
POD0000005509_S0000420 I THINK KIM JONG-IL WOULD VOTE FOR IT
POD0000005509_S0000426 AUNG SAN SUU KYI IN BURMA
POD0000005509_S0000433 DARFUR
POD0000005509_S0000444 POWER IS A LOT OF THINGS
POD0000005509_S0000453 ELLIOT ABRAMS A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS WHO SERVED AS DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER IN THE GEORGE W BUSH ADMINISTRATION
POD0000005509_S0000463 WE REALLY CAN'T ESCAPE THE WORLD AS IT IS
POD0000005509_S0000475 I REMEMBER WHEN PEOPLE SAID IF YOU GOT OUT OF VIETNAM ALL SOUTHEAST ASIA AND COMMUNISM AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF
POD0000005509_S0000483 TWENTY SIX PERCENT AGAINST
POD0000005517_S0000009 OUR DEBATE GOES IN THREE ROUNDS
POD0000005517_S0000020 NOT ENTIRELY
POD0000005517_S0000041 SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT AND LIVING IN RUSSIA
POD0000005517_S0000053 AND HERE TO SPEAK FROM THE LECTERN FIRST IN SUPPORT OF THIS MOTION
POD0000005517_S0000062 SPACE
POD0000005517_S0000067 ABOUT HOW EAST ASIA SHOULD COPE WITH A RISING CHINA
POD0000005517_S0000074 NOW YOU MAY SAY WELL WHAT RUSSIA IS FOR IS SOVEREIGNTY
POD0000005517_S0000084 RUSSIA IS A MARGINAL POWER AND IT'S MARGINALIZED ITSELF IT'S NOT THE WEST WE SHOWERED YELTSIN'S RUSSIA WITH MONEY
POD0000005517_S0000090 ITDOESN'T LIKE RESPECTING OTHER COUNTRIES' RIGHTS
POD0000005517_S0000097 RUSSIA IS A MARGINAL POWER
POD0000005517_S0000109 I'M TERRIBLY SORRY
POD0000005517_S0000117 PAYING VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO WHAT THAT COUNTRY REALLY NEEDED WHICH WAS THE RULE OF LAW AND LIBERTY
POD0000005517_S0000130 YOU MIGHT BE LESS CONCERNED WITH FANCIFUL GLOBAL IDEAS OF WONDERFUL GLOBAL INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND YOU MIGHT BE MORE CONCERNED WITH THE SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD ISSUE OF WHETHER YOU COULD SURVIVE DEFENSIBLY AS A COUNTRY
POD0000005517_S0000142 IAN BREMMER WILL NOW GO TO THE LECTERN
POD0000005517_S0000152 RIGHT
POD0000005517_S0000163 IKEA USED TO MAKE MORE MONEY PER SQUARE METER IN RUSSIA THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD IN THE EARLY NINETY S
POD0000005517_S0000171 ARMENIA
POD0000005517_S0000183 WE DON'T WANT THE MONEY
POD0000005517_S0000189 WE TOLD THEM RED LINE
POD0000005517_S0000202 CHANGE THE SUBJECT
POD0000005517_S0000216 RUSSIA
POD0000005517_S0000222 WHAT AN ACHIEVEMENT IT WOULD BE WE COULD SAY THAT THE NUCLEAR ARSENALS OF BOTH RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO THE BAREST MINIMUMS
POD0000005517_S0000245 HOW DOES HE TAKE THAT POWER AND PUT RUSSIA AT THE CENTER OF WORLD AFFAIRS IS HE HELPING FOR EXAMPLE
POD0000005517_S0000259 WERE IT NOT FOR RUSSIA
POD0000005517_S0000273 IAN BREMMER I CEDE TO THE AMBASSADOR THAT A NUCLEAR WEAPON IS NOT A SUGAR BEET
POD0000005517_S0000282 I MEAN THERE IS A MAJOR POWER OUT THERE THAT DOESN'T AGREE WITH US ON THINGS IT'S CALLED CHINA
POD0000005517_S0000297 SO I WANT TO TAKE THAT BACK TO EDWARD LUCAS IN THE DEFINITION THAT WAS JUST GIVEN BY YOUR OPPONENT ABOUT RUSSIA BEING A CRUCIAL POWER
POD0000005517_S0000318 THIS IS NOT A DEBATE ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION
POD0000005517_S0000337 POLLUTE THE ENVIRONMENT DO HORRIBLE THINGS
POD0000005517_S0000348 AND THE DESTABILIZATION OF THE SYRIAN REGIME HAS REDUCED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO ABJECT MISERY WHICH WAS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY
POD0000005517_S0000383 DOES THIS SIDE WANT TO RESPOND
POD0000005517_S0000393 AND THAT'S THE WAY IN WHICH A COUNTRY PROJECTS AN IDEA A WAY OF DOING THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO COPY
POD0000005517_S0000409 AND THEY RESOLVED THAT THEY WOULD NOT DO THAT ANYMORE
POD0000005517_S0000424 NO ONE REALLY HAS DEFINED POWER WELL EITHER SO LET ME TRY TO DO IT
POD0000005517_S0000433 THE UNITED STATES
POD0000005517_S0000451 THAT IS ONLY POSSIBLE WITH RUSSIAN AGREEMENT
POD0000005517_S0000468 HERE IS HOW IT WENT
POD0000005525_S0000024 NO
POD0000005525_S0000033 WE GO IN THREE ROUNDS LET'S MOVE ON TO ROUND ONE
POD0000005525_S0000038 BUT IN FACT THERE ARE TWO IDEAS IN THAT PREMISE
POD0000005525_S0000051 AS LONG AS WE KEEP PAYING FREE-FOR-SERVICE HOSPITALS ARE GOING TO BE THINKING MORE ABOUT MARGIN THAN THEY ARE ABOUT MISSION
POD0000005525_S0000065 EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE US HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS BROKEN
POD0000005525_S0000072 MY PARTNER DAVID FEINBERG IS A CHILD PSYCHIATRIST I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S AN EXPERT IN TERMINAL I'M AN ONCOLOGIST
POD0000005525_S0000080 JUST ONE EXAMPLE
POD0000005525_S0000090 THE KEY IS BEHAVIOR CHANGE BEHAVIOR CHANGE OF DOCTORS AND BEHAVIOR CHANGE OF PATIENTS
POD0000005525_S0000097 WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS CHANGE IN BUNDLED PAYMENTS IN CREATING EFFICIENCY
POD0000005525_S0000106 THANK YOU ZEKE EMANUEL
POD0000005525_S0000116 THE SON OF TWO IMMIGRANT PARENTS
POD0000005525_S0000137 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
POD0000005525_S0000144 WE DRANK ALCOHOL IN MODERATION
POD0000005525_S0000151 BUT THAT GRAPH IS ACTUALLY MISLEADING
POD0000005525_S0000156 SO CAN IT BE DONE
POD0000005525_S0000162 IT STARTS IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE COMMITTED TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING THERE
POD0000005525_S0000169 SO WE'VE DONE SOME THINGS AT GEISINGER
POD0000005525_S0000177 EVERY SINGLE PATIENT HAS HAD A DECREASE IN THEIR HEMOGLOBIN A ONE C
POD0000005525_S0000184 THEY SAY TO YOU
POD0000005525_S0000190 PEOPLE CALL US
POD0000005525_S0000204 I WANT TO TAKE THE ARGUMENT TO THE SIDE ARGUING FOR THE MOTION AND START WITH YOU SHANNON BROWNLEE
POD0000005525_S0000219 WHAT HAVE WE SEEN WE'VE SEEN TWO THINGS PHYSICIANS DOING MORE TOTAL JOINTS NOW
POD0000005525_S0000255 AND THERE WERE BIKE RACKS YES
POD0000005525_S0000273 WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO GIVE MONEY BACK TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO SUPPORT THE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION UNINSURED AMERICANS WE'RE GIVING FOOD
POD0000005525_S0000293 WELL IT'S THIRTEEN YEARS I THINK WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY TO DOING TWO THINGS CHANGING HOW WE PAY
POD0000005525_S0000322 IF WE'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO CHANGE IT IT WILL HAVE A VERY GOOD IMPACT UPON THE HEALTH OF THE COUNTRY I'M JUST STILL VERY SKEPTICAL THAT PEOPLE WILL DO IT
POD0000005525_S0000330 IF WE CAN GET DOCS AND THE CHOOSING WISELY IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF DOCS COMING FORWARD AND SAYING LET'S DO THE RIGHT THING AND YOU CAN POKE FUN AT IT BUT IT HAS IMPROVED CARE AND IT HAS COME FROM THE BOTTOM UP
POD0000005525_S0000347 BUT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DOESN'T GET IT YET
POD0000005525_S0000357 BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE'RE TERMINALLY ILL
POD0000005525_S0000363 WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TEN YEARS AGO YOU'D HAVE NEW COMPANIES IN THESE SPACES TO TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM
POD0000005525_S0000374 WE'RE MEDIOCRE
POD0000005525_S0000385 WE HOPPED ON A RED EYE WE FLEW TO MIAMI THERE HE WAS STRAPPED IN HIS BED INTUBATED
POD0000005525_S0000395 AND I WAS PRETTY SLEEP DEPRIVED I WAS A SECOND-YEAR FELLOW IN PSYCHIATRY
POD0000005525_S0000403 AND I STARTED CRYING BECAUSE I WAS SLEEP DEPRIVED
POD0000005525_S0000410 THEY WERE ABLE TO GET IN WITHIN THREE WEEKS
POD0000005525_S0000416 IT'S GOING TO TAKE US
POD0000005525_S0000423 ON THE FIRST VOTE ON THAT FORTY TWO PERCENT OF YOU AGREED WITH THE MOTION
POD0000005525_S0000432 WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME
POD0000005534_S0000020 MICHAEL SHERMER
POD0000005534_S0000036 AND SO FAR FROM SCIENCE REFUTING GOD I SEE SCIENCE AS A WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT FOR HELPING US LEARN ABOUT THE WORLD AND THUS LEARNING ABOUT ITS CREATOR
POD0000005534_S0000046 SO ON TO ROUND ONE OPENING STATEMENTS FROM EACH DEBATER IN TURN OUR MOTION IS SCIENCE REFUTES GOD AND HERE TO DEBATE FIRST IN SUPPORT OF THIS MOTION
POD0000005534_S0000063 BY NATURAL LAW
POD0000005534_S0000076 WE HAVE A PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION OF HOW A UNIVERSE COULD PRECISELY COME FROM NOTHING
POD0000005534_S0000088 HE IS A PROFESSOR OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AT MIT AND THE AUTHOR OF MONOPOLIZING KNOWLEDGE THE SCIENTIST REFUTES RELIGION DENYING REASON DESTROYING SCIENTISM
POD0000005534_S0000096 IS CONTENT TO STAND ON THE SIDELINES ONCE THE UNIVERSE HAS BEGUN
POD0000005534_S0000104 MAXWELL
POD0000005534_S0000118 SCIENCE
POD0000005534_S0000126 MICHAEL SHERMER
POD0000005534_S0000136 WHAT I'M ASKING YOU TO DO IS JUST GO ONE GOD FURTHER WITH US
POD0000005534_S0000145 NOW WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE LAST SEVERAL CENTURIES SINCE THE ENLIGHTENMENT
POD0000005534_S0000151 AND SO AGAIN WHAT'S MORE LIKELY THAT ONE OF THEM HAPPENS TO BE THE ONE TRUE RELIGION AND THE ONE TRUE GOD AND ALL THOSE OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED ARE FALSE GODS OR THAT
POD0000005534_S0000159 SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE PAST COMMITTED THEM
POD0000005534_S0000172 AND WE CAN'T HELP IF WE'RE CURIOUS IF WE'RE THOUGHTFUL TO SAY
POD0000005534_S0000177 THE ANSWERS ARE FROM SCIENCE
POD0000005534_S0000182 BECAUSE NONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS IS AMENABLE TO BEING DECIDED EMPIRICALLY
POD0000005534_S0000188 WHEN THE DISCOVERY OF THE BIG BANG CAME THIS BY THE WAY WAS AT A TIME WHEN MOST SCIENTISTS BELIEVED THE UNIVERSE WAS ETERNAL
POD0000005534_S0000194 NO ENERGY
POD0000005534_S0000201 NOT ONLY FOR THE EXISTENCE OF LIFE
POD0000005534_S0000209 WE ARE LIVING AT A TIME WHEN RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS DO NOT NEED TO BE AFRAID OF SCIENCE THEY SHOULD AS I DO EMBRACE SCIENCE AND WELCOME SCIENCE BECAUSE CORRECTLY UNDERSTOOD FAR FROM POINTING AWAY FROM GOD
POD0000005534_S0000220 THE TEAM ARGUING AGAINST THE MOTION DINESH D'SOUZA AND IAN HUTCHINSON
POD0000005534_S0000232 AND BY THE WAY IT DIDN'T TAKE SCIENCE TO TELL US THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN THE FIRST CENTURY KNEW THAT PEOPLE DON'T RISE FROM THE DEAD WHEN THEY'VE BEEN HUNG ON CROSSES
POD0000005534_S0000248 IT WAS THE PHILOSOPHER HUME WHO POINTED OUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT FROM NO AMOUNT OF EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATIONS HOWEVER LARGE
POD0000005534_S0000265 AND IT HAPPENS WOULDN'T YOU BE CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW THE DEITY OR WHATEVER IT IS REACHES INTO THE WORLD STIRS THE PARTICLES RECONFIGURES THE DNA SO THE CANCER CELLS QUIT REPLICATING SO RAPIDLY AND SO ON
POD0000005534_S0000284 WE MAY HAVE NO WAY TO FIND OUT BUT THAT'S A FACTUAL CLAIM EITHER THERE IS OR THERE ISN'T
POD0000005534_S0000313 GREW UP IN THE WEST WAS IN PART BECAUSE CHRISTIANITY IN ITS PHILOSOPHICAL AND THEOLOGICAL VIEWPOINTS
POD0000005534_S0000339 BUT ONCE YOU BEGIN TO STUDY THE OTHER RELIGIONS YOU DISCOVER SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING
POD0000005534_S0000355 NOW THE BIBLE DOES MAKE CERTAIN CLAIMS ABOUT THE WORLD AND ABOUT MAN
POD0000005534_S0000374 AND THERE WERE A HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE AND NINETY FIVE OF THEM SAID THAT THEY KNEW A GUY NAMED BILL
POD0000005534_S0000384 THAT WOULD VIOLATE EVIDENCE OF REALITY
POD0000005534_S0000400 I AM PROUD OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING I CAN BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART TO BE ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND THE MINUTE THERE'S A BIT OF EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS IT ISN'T TRUE I THROW IT OUT LIKE YESTERDAY'S NEWSPAPER IN FACT
POD0000005534_S0000411 TALKING AS IF SCIENCE IS ALL THE REAL KNOWLEDGE THERE IS THAT AS THIS SCIENTISTIC MOTION DOES
POD0000005534_S0000417 AND THEY ARE IN THE END MISREPRESENTING SCIENCE TO THE PUBLIC
POD0000005534_S0000427 AND THERE I REALIZED THAT NONE OF THOSE ARGUMENTS ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE IN AND OF THEMSELVES THE ARGUMENTS FOR GOD'S EXISTENCE
POD0000005534_S0000439 THANK YOU DINESH D'SOUZA
POD0000005534_S0000447 AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT
POD0000005534_S0000465 BEFORE THE VOTE THIRTY FOUR PERCENT THE SECOND VOTE THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT THAT'S UP FOUR PERCENT IT'S NOT ENOUGH THE TEAM ARGUING FOR THE MOTION
POD0000005542_S0000007 WE HAVE FOUR SUPERBLY QUALIFIED DEBATERS TWO AGAINST TWO
POD0000005542_S0000028 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED TO BE CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT
POD0000005542_S0000041 NONPARTISAN RESEARCH ORGANIZATION THAT'S DEDICATED TO OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF SOME OF THE TOUGHEST POLICY QUESTIONS CONFRONTING OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD
POD0000005542_S0000049 BUT
POD0000005542_S0000060 PALLIATIVE CARE IS SPECIALIZED CARE THAT'S FOCUSED ON RELIEVING PAIN
POD0000005542_S0000068 THE PALLIATIVE CARE GROUP NOT ONLY HAD A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE AND LESS DEPRESSION PRIOR TO THEIR DEATH
POD0000005542_S0000077 THAT'S WHY AT THE END OF THIS EVENING I URGE YOU TO VOTE FOR THE PROPOSITION
POD0000005542_S0000087 SO BY LATE NOVEMBER MY MOTHER WAS HEMORRHAGING AND HAD LOST THIRTY FIVE POUNDS
POD0000005542_S0000093 IT IS WRONG FOR SOCIAL ENGINEERS AND GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS TO MAKE THESE LIFE DECISIONS FOR YOU
POD0000005542_S0000103 A STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE BRITISH JOURNAL LANCET ONCOLOGY
POD0000005542_S0000111 NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
POD0000005542_S0000122 WE HAVE FOUR DEBATERS TWO TEAMS OF TWO FIGHTING IT OUT OVER THIS MOTION
POD0000005542_S0000131 THE QUESTION THAT WE CAN DISCUSS IS WHETHER WE SHOULD BE OPEN AND EXPLICIT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING
POD0000005542_S0000141 WE RANK IN TERMS OF HEALTH OUTCOMES SOMEWHERE AROUND THE LEVEL OF COUNTRIES LIKE SLOVENIA AND COSTA RICA
POD0000005542_S0000152 AND WHEN HE CALCULATED HOW MUCH IT WOULD HAVE COST TO SAVE THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES
POD0000005542_S0000160 IN OTHER WORDS ALMOST TEN TIMES NINE TIMES AS MUCH AS WOULD HAVE SAVED THE LIVES OF THESE YOUNG ACCIDENT VICTIMS
POD0000005542_S0000176 AT THE BEDSIDE BY THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND WHO ARE AFFECTED
POD0000005542_S0000182 IT'S EASIER TO BALANCE THE BUDGET ON THE BACKS OF THE SICK AND DYING THAN IT IS TO REFORM YOUR WAYS OF WASTEFUL SPENDING IN GOVERNMENT AND TRY TO WRENCH MONEY BACK FROM THE HANDS OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AT HOME AND ABROAD
POD0000005542_S0000189 AND THAT MAINTAINS THAT EVERY HUMAN LIFE IS PRECIOUS AND OUT TO BE RESPECTED AND PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW
POD0000005542_S0000196 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I URGE YOU TO VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSITION BECAUSE BY THE TIME YOU REACH THE END OF YOUR LIFE
POD0000005542_S0000208 THEY SAY THAT IT WOULD BE FALLING TO GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS TO MAKE INTENSELY PERSONAL DECISIONS THAT COST SHOULD NOT BE THE DRIVER OF A DECISION REGARDING THE END OF LIFE AND THAT THEY DEPICT A FUTURE WHERE BASICALLY THE ELDERLY WILL BE THROWN OVERBOARD
POD0000005542_S0000233 NOT EVERYBODY THINKS IT'S NICE
POD0000005542_S0000263 YOU CAN BUY IT
POD0000005542_S0000279 YOU'RE GOING TO COST US TOO MUCH
POD0000005542_S0000289 I SAW A WOMAN IN HER THIRTY S A MOTHER OF THREE WHO ROLLED IN THE DOOR WITH A HEMORRHAGIC STROKE
POD0000005542_S0000294 LOST HER COVERAGE COULD NOT AFFORD HER THREE BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICINES
POD0000005542_S0000309 THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THE RIGHT TO LIFE
POD0000005542_S0000317 IS THAT MORE PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHEN THEY DIE ABOUT WHEN THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH
POD0000005542_S0000334 YOU HAVE THREE GENTLEMEN SEVENTY TWO YEARS OLD
POD0000005542_S0000347 IT'S NOT A HEDGE AGAINST INDIVIDUALS
POD0000005542_S0000376 KEN SAID WE ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT RATIONING OCCURS
POD0000005542_S0000393 THAT ASSUMES THE FALLACY OF ONLY ONE ALTERNATIVE
POD0000005542_S0000398 BUT IT'S WORK TO EFFECT THESE SAVINGS
POD0000005542_S0000403 WHAT WE NEED IS A RATIONAL APPROACH TO END-OF-LIFE HEALTH CARE
POD0000005542_S0000410 WHETHER OR NOT YOU NEED IT
POD0000005542_S0000416 LOVE
POD0000005542_S0000426 MAMA WOULD SAY IT'S TIME
POD0000005556_S0000013 SURE IN ONE SENTENCE UTILITARIANISM IS THE VIEW THAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS THE ACT THAT WILL HAVE THE BEST CONSEQUENCES
POD0000005556_S0000026 WELL IT'S SOMEWHAT LESS TABOO BUT IN A SOCIETY IN WHICH PEOPLE TEND TO BE IN DENIAL ABOUT THE REALITY OF MORTALITY ALTOGETHER
POD0000005556_S0000048 ANDREW SOLOMON
POD0000005556_S0000055 IT'S ABOUT DIGNITY
POD0000005556_S0000064 IF I EVER GET TO THAT STATE OF PAIN
POD0000005556_S0000070 BUT SHE ALSO HAD THE PILLS
POD0000005556_S0000078 AND THEN AS HER VOICE SLOWED WITH THE MEDICATION SHE SAID
POD0000005556_S0000085 SHE WAS THE SAME PERSON IN DEATH THAT SHE HAD BEEN IN LIFE
POD0000005556_S0000097 BUT EMPOWERING PHYSICIANS TO ASSIST PATIENTS WITH SUICIDE IS QUITE ANOTHER MATTER
POD0000005556_S0000105 AND IT ALSO FOLLOWS THAT INFANTICIDE OUGHT TO BE PERMITTED FOR CHILDREN WITH CONGENITAL ILLNESSES
POD0000005556_S0000110 MARTIN
POD0000005556_S0000119 TO MAKE THEM DEAD
POD0000005556_S0000124 OUR INTRINSIC DIGNITY
POD0000005556_S0000130 THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEIR ULTIMATE VALUE DOESN'T DEPEND UPON HOW THEY LOOK
POD0000005556_S0000140 WE HAVE FOUR DEBATERS TWO TEAMS OF TWO
POD0000005556_S0000150 SECONDLY
POD0000005556_S0000157 BUT THERE ARE VERY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH NONE OF THESE THINGS APPLY
POD0000005556_S0000163 VALUABLE BY THEIR JUDGMENT NOT VALUABLE BY SOMEBODY ELSE'S JUDGMENT IMPOSING ON THEM THE IDEA THAT THEIR LIFE IS STILL WORTHWHILE
POD0000005556_S0000171 THAT ARGUMENT HAS BEEN AROUND IN THIS DEBATE FOR A LONG TIME
POD0000005556_S0000181 THANK YOU
POD0000005556_S0000190 NOT SOME KIND OF FORMULA IC DEATH
POD0000005556_S0000196 HAD MENTAL CAPACITY WAS NOT BEING COERCED AND WAS VERY VERY DISTRESSED
POD0000005556_S0000204 OVER SIXTEEN YEARS OF OREGON'S LAW
POD0000005556_S0000209 LAWS AREN'T JUST REGULATORY INSTRUMENTS THEY SEND A MESSAGE
POD0000005556_S0000218 FORTY PERCENT OF SERIOUSLY ILL PEOPLE HAVE SOME MENTAL DISTURBANCE OFTEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE ILLNESS OR ANXIETY OR TREATMENT
POD0000005556_S0000227 PLEASE VOTE AGAINST THIS UTILITARIAN MOTION
POD0000005556_S0000237 THEY MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT TO ASSIST IN TAKING SOMEBODY'S LIFE IS TO MAKE A SOMEBODY INTO A NOBODY AND THAT THAT IS PLAINLY AND MORALLY WRONG THAT ASSISTED SUICIDE
POD0000005556_S0000247 SO IF THE PERSON DOESN'T WANT TO BE HAVE A TREATMENT THEY CAN REFUSE IT
POD0000005556_S0000256 BUT PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED FUTILE AND TERMINATED
POD0000005556_S0000272 THAT WAS PRETTY POINTLESS BUT IF YOU BELIEVE IN INTRINSIC WORTH OF HUMAN LIFE
POD0000005556_S0000285 AND WE HAVE MANY HIGHLY REGULATED SYSTEMS
POD0000005556_S0000297 SO YOUR REGULATORY SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY FAILING AND IN VERMONT UNDERSTAND THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT AFTER THREE YEARS THEY WOULDN'T NEED TO HAVE THE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE ANYMORE BECAUSE DOCTORS COULD BE TRUSTED
POD0000005556_S0000317 THE LAW IS NARROW AND SPECIFIC
POD0000005556_S0000334 OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION
POD0000005556_S0000345 AND FROM THAT POINT ON SHE NEVER ASKED FOR LETHAL OVERDOSES
POD0000005556_S0000364 THE PATIENT OF COURSE THEN DOES NOT EAT
POD0000005556_S0000390 NOT JUST TEN OUT OF TEN
POD0000005556_S0000404 SO SHE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT CANCER AND ABOUT PEOPLE DYING FROM CANCER
POD0000005556_S0000410 ARE DEPRESSED AND IN PAIN
POD0000005556_S0000417 MANY PERSONS WHO RAISE THE QUESTION OF ASSISTED SUICIDE ARE DOING SO BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY TESTING THE WATERS
POD0000005556_S0000423 RATHER WE SHOULD REDIRECT OUR ENERGIES TOWARDS MAKING SURE THAT ALL PATIENTS GET THE KIND OF CARE THAT I THINK WE ALL WANT
POD0000005556_S0000432 AND I ALSO TAKE EXCEPTION TO THE IDEA THAT WE VALUE LIFE BY INSISTING THAT SOMEBODY TO BORROW YOUR PHRASE NOT BECOME A NOBODY
POD0000005556_S0000439 SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR'S MOTHER BEGGED HER FOR HELP WHEN SHE WAS SICK
POD0000005556_S0000445 A RACE HAD BEGUN BETWEEN DEATH ANDTORTURE
POD0000005556_S0000455 I DON'T GIVE THE MESSAGE THAT YOU ARE OF WORTH
POD0000005556_S0000462 AND SHE SAID THEY WERE THE RICHEST YEARS OF HER LIFE
POD0000005556_S0000475 THEY PICKED UP TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS IS THE NUMBER TO BEAT
POD0000005564_S0000022 YOUR MOST RECENT BOOK THE SILO EFFECT
POD0000005564_S0000040 MY ADVICE IS LOOK WHAT HE DOES AND DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS BECAUSE I THINK HIS ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS I'M ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOVE TO TAKE HIS THUMBS AWAY SO HE COULDN'T TWEET SO MUCH
POD0000005564_S0000051 BECAUSE
POD0000005564_S0000059 WHOSE SUPPORTERS SEE IT AS THE STARTING POINT FOR A NEW ERA OF SPREADING PROSPERITY WELL WHICH IS IT
POD0000005564_S0000067 ALL OF THE ISSUES HERE INCLUDING THE DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACT INCLUDING THE INCENTIVES TO ORDINARY WORKING PEOPLE TO GO TO COLLEGE TO GET MORE EDUCATION
POD0000005564_S0000076 IT'S NOT VERY MUCH OF AN INCENTIVE FOR NEW INVESTMENTS
POD0000005564_S0000081 IN VERY DEEP RECESSIONS
POD0000005564_S0000089 WELL I'M GOING TO DECLARE YES PARTLY BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE THIS DEBATE A BIT MORE INTERESTING
POD0000005564_S0000112 THANK YOU STEPHEN MOORE
POD0000005564_S0000133 WE WENT TO DONALD TRUMP AND SAID
POD0000005564_S0000146 AND THAT POLICY'S NOT EXACTLY ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW
POD0000005564_S0000157 RATES GO UP
POD0000005564_S0000186 IF YOU DID YOU DID PRETTY WELL IN THE U S STOCK MARKET
POD0000005564_S0000205 I WOULD DECLARE NO BECAUSE I THINK IT'S ONE FACTOR THAT IS FED INTO THAT STORY BUT CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY ONE AND NOT NECESSARILY THE MAJOR ONE
POD0000005564_S0000223 I DECLARE YES
POD0000005564_S0000237 WHEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TURNED THE CORNER WITH A GREAT DEAL OF HELP FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND WE PULLED OUT OF THE GREATEST RECESSION
POD0000005564_S0000244 THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS ADVISORS ARE NOW ABOUT TO SQUANDER THANK YOU
POD0000005564_S0000256 HAVING COMPETITION
POD0000005564_S0000277 BUT IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA
POD0000005564_S0000288 YOU START LOOKING FOR A BODY IN THE LIBRARY
POD0000005564_S0000304 IF I GET THE FINANCIAL SECTOR FIRED UP I WILL GET SHORT-TERM GROWTH
POD0000005564_S0000316 AND THAT IS A WRAP ON THIS RESOLUTION DEREGULATION IS DRIVING THE BOOMING ECONOMY
POD0000005564_S0000336 EVER YOU WILL GET THERE AFTER THIS PRESIDENT
POD0000005564_S0000344 THE SECOND THING THAT JUSTIFIES A HIGHER STOCK VALUATION IS THE DENOMINATOR IN THAT EQUATION WHICH IS THE DISCOUNT RATE THAT'S TAKING THINGS FROM THE FUTURE
POD0000005564_S0000351 THANK YOU JASON FURMAN
POD0000005564_S0000386 I'M NOT SURE THE LAST TIME YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT THE PERHAPS GREATEST ICON OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY I'M SPEAKING OF COURSE

POD0000005598_S0000057 NEVER BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED DEEPEST DARKEST THOUGHTS GROWING UP IN A CONSERVATIVE CATHOLIC HOUSEHOLD THINKING OF SEX IN GENERAL IS UNTHINKABLE
POD0000005598_S0000062 STILL I OFTEN ESCAPE TO A WORLD WHERE I AM FREE FROM MY DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY
POD0000005598_S0000067 I KNOW THAT IF HE CONTACTED ME AGAIN I WOULD RESPOND FOR A FEW MOMENTS OF ATTENTION
POD0000005598_S0000072 WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER TELLING A PARTNER OR CLOSE FRIEND YOUR FANTASIES
POD0000005598_S0000080 SHE WRITES I'M SUPPOSED TO FEEL EXCITED TO BE LIVING BUT I DON'T I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO BE OVER I'M SUPPOSED TO FEEL LIKE TALKING ABOUT MY SEXUAL ABUSE IN THERAPY WILL MAKE ME FEEL BETTER BUT I DON'T I FEEL FROZEN AND ASHAMED AND I CAN'T DO IT
POD0000005598_S0000087 WOULD KNOWING OTHER PEOPLE FEEL THE SAME WAY MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF SHE WRITES YES I'VE STARTED GROUP THERAPY AND AM FIGURING OUT THAT I AM NOT ALONE IN SOME OF MY FEELINGS BUT I STILL CAN'T GET OUT THIS PRISON I'VE MADE FOR MYSELF THAT SEPARATES ME FROM EVERYONE ELSE

POD0000005598_S0000129 THREE SURVEY NUMBERS AFTER YOURS
POD0000005598_S0000139 AND THIS WAS FILLED OUT BY A GUY WHO CALLS HIMSELF TROUBLED NATION

POD0000005598_S0000541 IF I'D BEEN ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER
POD0000005598_S0000559 IF IT WAS OKAY FOR MEN TO BE EXPRESSIVE ABOUT THEIR EMOTIONAL PAIN
POD0000005598_S0000586 AND WERE REALLY REALLY BAD THEN AND THEN REALLY REALLY BAD AGAIN IN

POD0000005598_S0000710 THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

POD0000005598_S0000883 THIS IS ALSO FROM THE SHAME AND SECRETS FILLED OUT BY A WOMAN WHO CALLS HERSELF ALONE AND OVERWHELMED
POD0000005598_S0000892 I PREFER NOT BEING TOUCHED
POD0000005598_S0000913 OF BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF THEM MY ANGER IS OVERWHELMING AT TIMES

POD0000005598_S0000942 I SOMETIMES GET OFF ON PORN WITH WOMEN SHITTING BUT I HAVE NO DESIRE FOR THAT IN REAL LIFE
POD0000005598_S0000953 DO THESE SECRETS AND THOUGHTS GENERATE ANY PARTICULAR FEELINGS TOWARDS YOURSELF
POD0000005598_S0000961 KIND OF FIDDLING WITH MY BAG AND FEELING UBER-GUILTY THAT I GOT THE LAST SEAT
POD0000005598_S0000967 THAT MIGHT INSPIRE YOU TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING THE NEXT DAY

POD0000005633_S0000053 PLEASE KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING
POD0000005633_S0000063 PEDOPHILES AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE PEDOPHILIC THOUGHTS AND I WOULD PUT YOU INTO THE LATTER CATEGORY
POD0000005633_S0000102 UM
POD0000005633_S0000109 A VERY SUCCESSFUL HOCKEY PLAYER
POD0000005633_S0000121 GROWING UP THAT HAD DIVORCED PARENTS ISN'T THAT WILD TO THINK ABOUT
POD0000005633_S0000129 BUT THAT IS NOT EVERYBODY'S PARENTS THAT I KNEW GROWING UP CERTAINLY
POD0000005633_S0000141 NEGATIVE THING RIGHT
POD0000005633_S0000152 WANTED AND IMPORTANT TO THEM
POD0000005633_S0000170 I MEAN I FEEL LIKE EVERY DAY I COULD HAVE GOTTEN A CALL THAT WAS LIKE
POD0000005633_S0000193 OR LIKE
POD0000005633_S0000210 SO I THINK MY PARENTS WERE REALLY
POD0000005633_S0000222 WHAT'S IT LIKE HAVING THAT SECRET INSIDE YOU
POD0000005633_S0000242 I THINK SHE'S JUST LIKE A REALLY FUNNY PERSON AND DID YOU KNOW THAT THAT WAS WHY YOU WERE ATTRACTED TO HER THEN
POD0000005633_S0000281 LIKE HER FACE IS FIRST OF ALL NOT SEEMING REALLY INTO IT AND THEN ALSO HER BODY IS CLEARLY DOING SOMETHING THAT
POD0000005633_S0000314 YOU KNOW MEN ARE SO GENITAL-FOCUSED AND I THINK THEY ASSUME THAT WOMEN MUST BE TO A CERTAIN DEGREE AS WELL AND THEY THINK HOW CAN A LESBIAN BE TURNED ON BY AN ERECTION AND THEN NOT WANT IT OUTSIDE OF THAT SITUATION
POD0000005633_S0000327 EVEN MASTURBATED TO IT BUT
POD0000005633_S0000335 I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD
POD0000005633_S0000345 AS IF THERE'S LIKE A TALLY
POD0000005633_S0000387 BUT HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW HILARIOUS THIS IS YOU KNOW A KIND OF DIVERSION TACTIC

POD0000005633_S0000430 IT'S SHOCKING TO ME LOOKING BACK ON IT
POD0000005633_S0000453 I CAME OUT AT A COLLEGE WHERE THEY REFUSED TO HAVE A NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY ABOUT SEXUAL ORIENTATION
POD0000005633_S0000477 CATHOLIC PEOPLE
POD0000005633_S0000500 SO IT'S JUST A LACK OF THE RIGHT MEDICINES GETTING THERE
POD0000005633_S0000509 IF WE HAD HIRED OR PAID FOR
POD0000005633_S0000532 TWO DOLLARS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
POD0000005633_S0000560 THEN I JUST HAVE TO LIKE

POD0000005633_S0000645 STEP UP AND BECOME THAT ADULT BEFORE THEY SHOULD BE AN ADULT AND IT TAKES A PART OF THEIR INNOCENCE AWAY
POD0000005633_S0000651 IN MY TWENTIES
POD0000005633_S0000659 HELD DOWN
POD0000005633_S0000680 SO WHEN SOMEBODY
POD0000005633_S0000685 I HAVE GOOD SUGGESTIONS I EMPATHIZE
POD0000005633_S0000695 BUT I AM ALSO IN MY OWN HEAD
POD0000005633_S0000709 BECAUSE I KNOW FOR A LOT OF YEARS I THOUGHT THAT I WAS
POD0000005633_S0000721 I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS INTO UNDERSTANDING THAT ABOUT MYSELF BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT I HAVE
POD0000005633_S0000741 YOU KNOW YES
POD0000005633_S0000755 SORT OF PER REQUEST
POD0000005633_S0000771 WHICH IS AWKWARD SOMETIMES IN CONVERSATION NOT BECAUSE
POD0000005633_S0000779 IT WAS REALLY BAD ACTUALLY
POD0000005633_S0000794 WORKED THROUGH A LOT OF OUR ISSUES THERE
POD0000005633_S0000812 DEGENERATE SEX THAT WE PICTURE WHEN WE PICTURE
POD0000005633_S0000820 NOT THAT YOU CAN'T BE FEMININE
POD0000005633_S0000845 COMPLICATION OF SEXUAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN EITHER OF US
POD0000005633_S0000868 UNATTAINABLE TO ME ON A CERTAIN LEVEL BEFORE
POD0000005633_S0000887 YOU'RE ANNOYING AS HELL
POD0000005633_S0000903 I'M AFRAID MY LIFE HAS NO MEANING THAT I'M SIMPLY TAKING UP SPACE IN OUR WORLD
POD0000005633_S0000909 I'M AFRAID THAT THERE IS NO ONE IN THE WORLD THAT WILL LOVE ME IN A ROMANTIC WAY BECAUSE I HAVE BOTH GENITAL HERPES AND GENITAL WARTS EVEN THOUGH THE DISEASES WERE HOW I FOUND OUT THAT A FORMER LONG-TERM BOYFRIEND WAS CHEATING ON ME
POD0000005633_S0000929 OH YEAH
POD0000005633_S0000944 I'M AFRAID I WON'T BE A GOOD THERAPIST
POD0000005633_S0000958 CHAP STICK
POD0000005633_S0000969 I LOVE FINDING A SMALL TUBE OF HAND LOTION IN MY PURSE AND AFTER PUTTING IT ON OFFERING IT TO SOMEONE ELSE SEATED NEXT TO ME IN A GROUP

POD0000005825_S0000262 AN OBJECT OF COURSE BUT IT'S BETTER THAN YOU KNOW UGLY
POD0000005825_S0000269 THE CONSTANT MENTAL TURMOIL OF LIVING WITH SOMEONE WHO JUST CONSTANTLY PROJECTS
POD0000005825_S0000276 SOMETIMES MY INTELLIGENCE WAS SEEN BUT MOSTLY MY BEAUTY WAS SEEN AND THEN REFLECTED BACK AND I GOT I THRIVED ON THAT
POD0000005825_S0000283 AND NEGOTIATED FOR MY RELEASE WITH ONE OF THE POLITICIANS WHO WAS LIKE THE UNOFFICIAL LEADER OF THE NETWORK
POD0000005825_S0000294 OUT OF FEAR THAT REALLY I WAS AN ABUSER
POD0000005825_S0000303 SO YOU THINK YOU WERE THE ONE THAT

POD0000005825_S0000407 SO SHE HAD NO LIMITS BUT SHE WAS PRACTICAL TOO
POD0000005825_S0000418 OVER THE YEARS
POD0000005825_S0000427 YOU KNOW

POD0000005825_S0000448 IN THE TOWN WHERE SHE LIVED THERE WAS STARVATION
POD0000005825_S0000461 AND
POD0000005825_S0000473 THAT ABUSER WHO RESCUED ME
POD0000005825_S0000491 IN THE MOMENT WHEN HE RELEASED ME
POD0000005825_S0000496 AND HE CRIED AND ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS
POD0000005825_S0000501 AND THEN TURNED TO CRIME
POD0000005825_S0000511 HE DID THE SAME THING TO ME HE STABBED ME
POD0000005825_S0000519 BUT HE DID
POD0000005825_S0000524 EMBRACE IT
POD0000005825_S0000532 I FEEL VERY SOFT
POD0000005825_S0000545 AND HE HAD BEEN STABBED IN THE LEG BY HIS FATHER AND HE STABBED ME IN THE LEG
POD0000005825_S0000558 NO

POD0000005825_S0000575 BREAK
POD0000005825_S0000584 SO
POD0000005825_S0000601 AND
POD0000005825_S0000608 INSANE
POD0000005825_S0000616 WITHOUT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO HOPE FOR ME
POD0000005825_S0000622 I WOULD IMAGINE NINETY PERCENT OF THE KIDS
POD0000005825_S0000630 BELIEVING OR NOT BELIEVING AS IF
POD0000005825_S0000637 A REPETITION AND A BETRAYAL
POD0000005825_S0000648 MANY MANY YEARS I
POD0000005825_S0000654 SO NOW I'M BEING TRUE TO THAT
POD0000005825_S0000661 HOW SOCIETY VIEWS THEM
POD0000005825_S0000675 PHYSICALLY PLEASURABLE BECAUSE OF THE FEAR
POD0000005825_S0000682 SEXUALLY HEIGHTENED THERE HAD TO BE SOME KIND OF EXTERNAL STIMULUS THAT WAS RELATED TO THE ABUSE THAT YOU HAD EXPERIENCED I NEVER LOOKED FOR IT
POD0000005825_S0000691 SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WERE ABUSED BECOME PROMISCUOUS
POD0000005825_S0000706 BUT I HAVE OF COURSE SO MUCH ANGER IN ME AND IT IS MY GREATEST
POD0000005825_S0000719 OH MY GOD
POD0000005825_S0000734 I INSTEAD
POD0000005825_S0000740 BUT ALL IN A VERY SUBTLE LEVEL I HAVE TO SAY
POD0000005825_S0000757 YEAH THAT'S WHAT I DO I TRY TO HONOR MY TRIGGERS
POD0000005825_S0000763 WHITE
POD0000005825_S0000769 AND ALSO COULD
POD0000005825_S0000777 YOU KNOW LIKE TAKING MY DAUGHTER TO SCHOOL HAS BEEN A VERY BIG CHALLENGE AND YOU KNOW SO I'VE HAD TO MEET IT AND I'VE BECOME
POD0000005825_S0000788 TO WORK WITH TRIGGERS
POD0000005825_S0000808 VICTIMIZED
POD0000005825_S0000827 AND I LOOKED STRAIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE PERSON WHO WAS LOOKING AT ME THAT WAY AND THAT'S HOW I COULD MOVE ON BECAUSE I WAS INCLINED TO LOOK DOWN
POD0000005825_S0000843 BUT THE WAY THAT WE TEACH IS VERY DIFFERENT
POD0000005825_S0000848 A RESPECTFUL WAY OF SPEAKING TO SOMEONE
POD0000005825_S0000858 AND YES THAT WAS THE FIRST STRONG EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD THERE THAT IT'S UP TO ME
POD0000005825_S0000876 I ALSO SHARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE WITH THAT POPULATION
POD0000005825_S0000890 WHAT DO YOU SAY TO SOMEBODY WHO'S OUT THERE AND LISTENING AND JUST FEELING TRAUMATIZED BY THEIR STORY
POD0000005825_S0000899 AND I DON'T SAY THAT SELFISHLY I SAY THAT AS MY LIFE REALLY IS IN THE CONTEXT OF HEALING BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE
POD0000005825_S0000905 THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING RIGHT EXACTLY WHERE I AM
POD0000005825_S0000911 SO IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE THERE AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD BE FARTHER ALONG
POD0000005825_S0000918 THAT'S OK

POD0000005891_S0000867 THAT IS AN AWESOME NAME
POD0000005891_S0000874 WE WERE ROLLING DOWN THE HILL WITH THE NEIGHBOR AND HE KEPT KISSING ME ON THE MOUTH IT MADE ME FEEL REALLY WEIRD AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT I WENT INSIDE BUT I LEFT MY BROTHER
POD0000005891_S0000881 AND IT SEEMS THE MORE I TRY TO STOP THEM THE MORE THEY WON'T GO AWAY
POD0000005891_S0000892 HE MAKES A NOISE AND I HEAR HIM
POD0000005891_S0000901 HAVE YOU SHARED THESE THINGS WITH OTHERS YES PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTIVE
POD0000005891_S0000912 AND SHE WRITES MY DAD DIED A FEW YEARS AGO WE DIDN'T HAVE A VERY ACTIVE RELATIONSHIP
POD0000005891_S0000918 BUT THEN ENDED BIZARRELY WITH SOME STUDENTS OF MY STEPMOTHER'S DOING A BAREFOOT INTERPRETIVE DANCE TO CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIAN MUSIC
POD0000005891_S0000925 I REALLY HAD QUITE A GOOD TIME AT THAT FUNERAL AND THINK ABOUT THOSE DANCING VIRGINS ALL THE TIME
POD0000005891_S0000935 DARKEST THOUGHTS
POD0000005891_S0000943 I PLAY GAMES WITH PEOPLE'S HEARTS AND EMOTIONS BECAUSE I NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GIVE A DAMN
POD0000005891_S0000948 NOW THAT I'M NOT BEING MANIPULATED BY YOU ALL I WANT IS TO READ YOUR OBITUARY IN THE NEWSPAPER WHILE I HAVE MY MORNING TEA
POD0000005891_S0000956 UNEARTH ALL THAT UNCOMFORTABLE SHIT
POD0000005891_S0000964 BEING ABLE TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE NOT FEELING LIKE I HAVE TO CARRY THE BURDEN ON MY OWN
POD0000005891_S0000973 THIS IS FROM THE SHAME AND SECRET SURVEY FILLED OUT BY A GUY WHO CALLS HIMSELF NERVOUS ABOUT THIS AND HE ONLY PARTIALLY FILLED THIS OUT
POD0000005891_S0000982 AND I THINK THIS STUFF WITH HIS MOM IS
POD0000005891_S0000988 WE HAVE NEVER DISCUSSED IT ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM
POD0000005891_S0000997 AND
POD0000005891_S0001003 IT FELT HUMILIATING AND EMASCULATING WHICH I THINK WAS THE POINT
POD0000005891_S0001017 AND HE WRITES I CALLED MY DAD TO ASK IF HE WOULD BE OUT
POD0000005891_S0001026 I PRESSED SEND AND QUICKLY HEARD A SEXY VOICE INSTRUCT ME TO GIVE MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER BEFORE GETTING STARTED WITH OUR FUN
POD0000005891_S0001038 I JUST CAN'T STAND IT
POD0000005891_S0001045 BEING COMPLETELY NAKED IN THE BATH I AM VERY VERY UNHAPPY WITH MY APPEARANCE
POD0000005891_S0001051 AN EXCITING CALMNESS
POD0000005891_S0001057 JUST LOVE IT
POD0000005891_S0001067 AND THERE'S A HUGE STIGMA AGAINST IT IN MY FAMILY MY DAD USED TO SAY THAT MENTAL ILLNESS DIDN'T EXIST
POD0000005891_S0001074 I DECIDED THAT I HAD TO THANK HER FOR EVERYTHING SHE'S DONE FOR ME WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT I WAS KIND OF DIZZY AND FEVERISH AND TERRIFIED
POD0000005891_S0001080 SHE HUGGED ME
POD0000005891_S0001086 I WAS ECSTATIC
POD0000005891_S0001091 BY THE TIME MY FRIEND AND I LEFT THE BATHROOM SHE WAS SO SUPPORTIVE I'M LUCKY TO HAVE HER PEOPLE WERE LINING UP FOR PICTURES AND AUTOGRAPHS MY FRIEND ASKED ME IF I WANTED A PICTURE I SAID NO I CAN'T BOTHER HER AGAIN SHE'LL THINK I'M MARK DAVID CHAPMAN
POD0000005891_S0001096 AND SHE LAUGHED
POD0000005891_S0001101 BEFORE WE PARTED WAYS SHE ASKED ME IF I LISTENED TO THE MENTAL ILLNESS HAPPY HOUR AND I SAID YES
POD0000005891_S0001107 LISTENING TO THIS PODCAST HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR ME AND IT ALSO INSPIRED ME TO RESEARCH LOW-FEE MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN MY AREA
POD0000005891_S0001113 WHICH I NEED BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE MYSELF
POD0000005891_S0001118 AND I'M TAKING THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS GETTING A PSYCHIATRIST AND MEDICATION
POD0000005891_S0001125 I FEEL HAPPY
POD0000005908_S0000010 SONAL SHARES HER BELIEFS FOR WHY THE PODCAST MEDIUM HAS TAKEN OFF AND DESCRIBES HOW HER BACKGROUND IN EDUCATION
POD0000005908_S0000019 YOU CAN CONSIDER ASKING YOUR COMPANY OR YOUR MANAGER TO PAY FOR YOUR TICKET KAFKA SUMMIT IS AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH TOP ENGINEERS FROM PLACES LIKE NETFLIX
POD0000005908_S0000024 AS WELL AS CERTIFICATION
POD0000005908_S0000048 WHAT WOULD FORMALLY VERY ELITE IDEAS MORE AVAILABLE IN THE FORM OF MATH BOOKS
POD0000005908_S0000061 WHO IS ONE OF THE GENERAL PARTNERS WHO IS REALLY INTERESTED IN INVESTING IN PODCASTING STARTUP
POD0000005908_S0000073 I DON'T BELIEVE EVERYBODY WANTS TO FOLLOW EVERY SINGLE EPISODE OF A PODCAST IF IT'S NOT A SERIALIZED NARRATIVE SHOW THEY WANT TOPICAL THINGS
POD0000005908_S0000097 IN THE PAST APPLE HASN'T REALLY INVESTED DEEPLY IN PODCASTING YOU KNOW THE CLASSIC STORY THERE'S LIKE TWO PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OR FIVE PEOPLE OR WHATEVER IT IS IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE NOW BUT THE THING ABOUT APPLE IS THAT BECAUSE OF THEIR BIG POSITION ON PROTECTING USER PRIVACY
POD0000005908_S0000113 BUILDING SELF-DRIVING CARS IS COMPLEX INVOLVING PROBLEMS UP AND DOWN THE STACK
POD0000005908_S0000119 CRUISE IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN BUILD ON YOUR EXISTING SKILLS WHILE DEVELOPING NEW SKILLS AND EXPERIENCES THAT ARE PIONEERING THE FUTURE OF INDUSTRY
POD0000005908_S0000124 THANK YOU TO CRUISE FOR BEING A SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
POD0000005908_S0000147 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ESTABLISHED MEDIA CHANNELS
POD0000005908_S0000157 WHERE DO I FIND THE FIVE BEST EPISODES ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC
POD0000005908_S0000170 JUST LIKE I'M TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY IS NOT JUST OBJECTS AND CODE AND LIKE SORT OF THESE CLINICAL ALGORITHMS IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
POD0000005908_S0000183 BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY NOT WHAT THE PERSON DOES
POD0000005908_S0000193 THERE'S A LOT MORE NUANCE TO IT
POD0000005908_S0000202 AND I THINK THAT MEDIA IS ACTUALLY A VERY HELPFUL THING
POD0000005908_S0000218 WHY WOULDN'T WE LEARN THAT FROM MEDIA I MEAN MEDIA HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE HAVE CONVERSATIONS IN THE WORLD ALL THE TIME
POD0000005908_S0000228 ENGINEERS DON'T LIKE SACRIFICING THEIR TIME TO DO PHONE SCREENS
POD0000005908_S0000233 TRIPLEBYTE IS A PLATFORM FOR FINDING A GREAT SOFTWARE JOB FASTER
POD0000005908_S0000239 IF YOU PASS THAT INTERVIEW YOU MAKE IT STRAIGHT TO MULTIPLE ONSITE INTERVIEWS
POD0000005908_S0000246 THIS MEANS THAT THEY WORK WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE FROM NONTRADITIONAL AND UNUSUAL BACKGROUNDS
POD0000005908_S0000269 SO HERE'S MY VIEW ON WHERE ACADEMIA AND PLACES LIKE PARK HAVE A VERY SPECIAL ROLE TO PLAY THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN PLAY
POD0000005908_S0000285 GIVEN YOUR BACKGROUND IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF TECHNOLOGY
POD0000005908_S0000293 I'LL TELL YOU ONE OF MY FAVORITE ANECDOTES FROM WHEN I WAS IN GRAD SCHOOL I WAS WORKING IN A GRANT FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND NUMERACY IN PRESCHOOLERS
POD0000005908_S0000316 I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN EDITING
POD0000005908_S0000331 I ACTUALLY OFTEN SAY THAT THE HARDEST WORK IN A PODCAST HAPPENS BEFORE AND AFTER THE EPISODE NOT ACTUALLY DURING IT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THE HARDEST PART IS THE ACTUAL PODCAST ITSELF
POD0000005908_S0000350 CHECK OUT PODSHEETS DOT COM
POD0000005908_S0000356 THESE ARE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY WE KNOW THEM INTIMATELY
POD0000005908_S0000361 WE'LL HELP YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS
POD0000005916_S0000004 THE STORE NEEDS TO ORDER MORE OF THAT FOOD FROM A CENTRAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
POD0000005916_S0000009 AFRESH IS A COMPANY THAT BUILDS SOFTWARE FOR GROCERY STORES
POD0000005916_S0000014 AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE CHECKOUT SYSTEMS DETECT WHAT HAS BEEN SOLD TO HELP UPDATE THE INVENTORY
POD0000005916_S0000021 IT'S A PLACE TO FIND COLLABORATORS AND BUILD PROJECTS
POD0000005916_S0000027 AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU ON FIND COLLABS
POD0000005916_S0000036 AND ELASTIC SCALING
POD0000005916_S0000053 WHAT ARE THE AREAS OF WASTE WITHIN A GROCERY STORE
POD0000005916_S0000073 GROCERY STORES DO HAVE SOME TECHNOLOGY
POD0000005916_S0000087 YOU MENTIONED SECURITY CAMERAS THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY
POD0000005916_S0000105 NOW ALL THAT INFORMATION COMES VIA THE TABLET
POD0000005916_S0000121 SO FIRST OF ALL
POD0000005916_S0000140 OR AN ESTABLISHED COMPANY THAT WANTS ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING HELP
POD0000005916_S0000145 THESE ARE ENGINEERS WHO KNOW ABOUT THE REACT ECOSYSTEM ABOUT THE MOBILE ECOSYSTEM ABOUT GRAPHQL REACT NATIVE
POD0000005916_S0000154 THE PROBLEM IS YOU ARE KIND OF BY DEFINITION EARLY BECAUSE YOU'RE BUILDING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ADAPT
POD0000005916_S0000168 YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION
POD0000005916_S0000202 BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THE TECHNOLOGICAL SOPHISTICATION OF WHOLE FOODS WHICH IS VERY SOPHISTICATED VERSUS YOUR RANDOM MOM AND POP GROCERY STORE OR LIKE A FARMERS MARKET
POD0000005916_S0000221 BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY MOST OF THE PROFITS OF THESE STORES HAVE BEEN FROM NON-PERISHABLES
POD0000005916_S0000229 BUT NOW WE UNDERSTAND YOUR SYSTEMS REALLY WELL
POD0000005916_S0000235 WHETHER THEY'RE SELLING TO BANKS OR SELLING TO INSURANCE COMPANIES OR SELLING TO OIL COMPANIES THEY KIND OF HAVE TO DO THIS SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR KIND OF LIKE CONSULTATIVE APPROACH
POD0000005916_S0000262 NOW THE OUTPUT OF THIS MODEL IS A PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
POD0000005916_S0000277 BUT YOU HAVE LIKE A MOBILE APPLICATION THAT'S SITTING ON A TABLET SOMEWHERE
POD0000005916_S0000297 YEAH
POD0000005916_S0000324 IT RAISES SOMETHING IN MY MIND THAT'S KIND OF AN ADJACENT TOPIC TO THIS WHOLE SOFTWARE THING
POD0000005916_S0000334 EXPLAIN THE TERM ACCURATE UNCERTAINTY USING AN EXAMPLE FROM THE GROCERY DOMAIN
POD0000005916_S0000354 I MEAN THERE ARE MANY APPLICATIONS I MEAN
POD0000005916_S0000369 CONTINUOUS DELIVERY HELPS YOU RELEASE YOUR SOFTWARE FASTER AND MORE RELIABLY
POD0000005924_S0000010 THIS ROLE WILL INCLUDE WORK ON SOFTWAREDAILY DOT COM
POD0000005924_S0000015 WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS HUNGRY AND WANTS TO LEARN QUICKLY AND WANTS TO BUILD LOTS OF SOFTWARE
POD0000005924_S0000021 REPLICATED PROVIDES TOOLS TO DELIVER YOUR KUBERNETES-BASED APPLICATION TO ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS AS A MODERN ON PREM PRIVATE INSTANCE
POD0000005924_S0000026 INSTEAD OF YOUR CUSTOMER SENDING THEIR DATA TO YOU
POD0000005924_S0000033 THAT'S A STRONG SIGN OF ADAPTION
POD0000005924_S0000039 E C TWO WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT ON THE ZEN HYPERVISOR
POD0000005924_S0000114 LOOKING FOR A JOB IS PAINFUL
POD0000005924_S0000122 WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO FIND A JOB
POD0000005924_S0000147 THE OTHER PART OF THE PROBLEM WAS FOR CUSTOMERS USING VPC WITH LAMBDA HOW QUICKLY CAN I INSTANTIATE THE NETWORKING RESOURCES
POD0000005924_S0000236 THE WORLD IS NOW MORE MOBILE
POD0000005924_S0000267 TEAMS TRUST PAGERDUTY TO HELP THEM DELIVER HIGH-QUALITY DIGITAL EXPERIENCES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS
POD0000005924_S0000274 I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE PAGER DUTY AS A SPONSOR I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THEM ON A PODCAST PROBABLY MORE THAN FIVE YEARS AGO
POD0000005932_S0000008 SARAH DRASNER HAS BEEN EVANGELIZING THE VALUE OF ANIMATIONS FOR YEARS AND SHE'S AN EXPERT AT IMPLEMENTING COMPLEX AND BEAUTIFUL ANIMATIONS ON THE WEB
POD0000005932_S0000021 IN ADDITION TO THE VUE WEB APP AT SOFTWAREDAILY DOT COM
POD0000005932_S0000053 WHERE EVERYTHING WAS
POD0000005932_S0000077 YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORKING WITH ANIMATIONS AND TINKERING AS WELL AS BUILDING LARGER SCALE PROJECTS THAT HAVE A LARGE ANIMATED COMPONENT
POD0000005932_S0000098 VUE DID DO A REALLY COOL THING HERE IN TERMS OF ANIMATION THAT MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT BUT THEN
POD0000005932_S0000117 DO YOU WANT TO WORK WITH A Y COMBINATORY STARTUP
POD0000005932_S0000125 I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR REACT OR REACT NATIVE EMPLOYMENT FULL-TIME
POD0000005932_S0000140 ANOTHER EXAMPLE I COULD USE FOR THIS IS LIKE
POD0000005932_S0000168 IF YOU LOOK AT LIKE SOMETHING LIKE AN AIRPORT
POD0000005932_S0000189 SO THERE'S ALL THESE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS AND COMMANDS
POD0000005932_S0000201 YOU COULD SAY FINGER ONE
POD0000005932_S0000212 THIS IS WHERE I GET REALLY EXCITED
POD0000005932_S0000233 MAYBE YOU ARE JUST STARTING OUT WITH A NEW APP BUT YOU HAVE DREAMS OF SCALING INTO THE NEXT GIANT UNICORN
POD0000005932_S0000239 IF YOU LIKE TO WORK WITH A FULLY MANAGED PLATFORM AS A SERVICE
POD0000005932_S0000259 I BROUGHT IT DOWN TO UNDER TWO SECONDS
POD0000005932_S0000275 WE HAVE OPERA MINI IT'S SUPPORTED BACK TO I E EIGHT
POD0000005932_S0000311 MAKES SENSE
POD0000005932_S0000343 DEVELOPERS LISTEN TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE LATEST STRATEGIES AND TOOLS FOR BUILDING SOFTWARE
POD0000005932_S0000348 OR EMAIL YOUR MARKETING DIRECTOR AND TELL THEM THAT THEY SHOULD SEND ME AN EMAIL
POD0000005940_S0000072 THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO EXPERIMENT WITH
POD0000005948_S0000008 WHILE ALSO PROVIDING SOME COST SAVINGS
POD0000005948_S0000015 BEFORE WE GET STARTED
POD0000005948_S0000021 AND THE SECOND PLACE PRIZE IS SIMILAR BUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS
POD0000005948_S0000029 WE HAVE AN IOS CLIENT AND AN ANDROID CLIENT AND WE GET BUG REPORTS ALL THE TIME FROM USERS THAT ARE ON OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT WE DID NOT TEST
POD0000005948_S0000035 BITBAR TESTS YOUR APP ON REAL DEVICES
POD0000005948_S0000042 YOU HAVE A MOBILE APP THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS DEPEND ON
POD0000005948_S0000049 AND THANKS TO BITBAR
POD0000005948_S0000061 LIKE A PHYSICAL SERVER
POD0000005948_S0000069 IT'S ACTUALLY THE FIRST THING I EVER DID ON E C TWO BACK IN THE DAY
POD0000005948_S0000088 SO IF YOU HAVE NO WORK TO DO
POD0000005948_S0000093 DON'T RUN IT ON MORE THAN ONE MACHINE
POD0000005948_S0000104 A DOCKER CONTAINER RUNNING ON AN E C TWO INSTANCE
POD0000005948_S0000118 THOSE ARE THINGS THAT A CUSTOMER SETS UP
POD0000005948_S0000129 WE WILL GIVE YOU AN INSTANCE AND WE WILL GUARANTEE THAT UNDERNEATH THE HOOD WE ARE DOING THE BEST WE CAN TO GIVE YOU A HIGH QUALITY EXPERIENCE
POD0000005948_S0000137 AND WHAT'S ON TOP IS A CUSTOMER'S RESPONSIBILITY
POD0000005948_S0000147 THE NEXT STEP OF THAT IS FARGATE THE MACHINE GOES AWAY
POD0000005948_S0000159 IS LAMBDA WHERE ALL YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR IS THE CODE THAT YOU BRING NOT THE CONTAINER
POD0000005948_S0000167 MAKE IT RUN
POD0000005948_S0000180 IF WE WERE TO MAP THOSE DIFFERENT WORKLOAD TYPES THE BATCH
POD0000005948_S0000189 THAT IS THE CANONICAL CONTAINER USE CASE
POD0000005948_S0000202 LIKE SLURM THEY WERE DOING IT ON E C TWO
POD0000005948_S0000211 JUST TELL US HOW MUCH CPU YOU NEED ROUGHLY
POD0000005948_S0000219 JUST SPIN EVERYTHING DOWN
POD0000005948_S0000232 BUT THE FACT THAT WE COULD BUILD A PURPOSE BUILT SERVICE FOR BATCH COMPUTING IS WHAT DID THAT
POD0000005948_S0000242 WE WANT TO ABSTRACT THAT AWAY AND PUT THEM INTO PURPOSE BUILT SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO DO
POD0000005948_S0000249 WIX CODE UNITES DESIGN FEATURES WITH ADVANCED CODE CAPABILITIES SO YOU CAN BUILD DATA-DRIVEN WEBSITES AND PROFESSIONAL WEB APPS VERY QUICKLY
POD0000005948_S0000257 ALTHOUGH OF COURSE IF YOU ARE A DEVELOPER
POD0000005948_S0000266 YEAH SO BATCH COMPUTING AT ITS HEART IS I HAVE SOME WORK TO DO THAT WORK IS BEST DONE BY SPLITTING IT UP ACROSS MANY MANY MACHINES
POD0000005948_S0000272 TEN COPIES I CAN SPIN IT UNDER TEN MACHINES
POD0000005948_S0000283 I HAVE A BUNCH OF IMAGES I WANT TO CONVERT THEM INTO FIVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF THUMBNAILS
POD0000005948_S0000301 THE SECOND ONE IS A CONCEPT CALLED ARRAY JOBS WHERE YOU HAVE AN EXECUTABLE
POD0000005948_S0000311 YOU ARE USING A SET OF TOOLS THAT PROBABLY MOST BIOLOGISTS ARE FAMILIAR WITH
POD0000005948_S0000323 SO WE BUILT OUR OWN SCHEDULER THAT UNDERSTANDS THINGS LIKE SPOT INSTANCES
POD0000005948_S0000332 PLEASE DO IT FOR ME
POD0000005948_S0000347 USUALLY
POD0000005948_S0000356 SO YOU HAVE A FINITE RESOURCES
POD0000005948_S0000367 I HAVE WORK
POD0000005948_S0000379 TYPES OF RUNTIMES WE DISCUSSED EARLIER E C TWO
POD0000005948_S0000390 BUT YOU CAN DEFINE A GRAPH IN STEP FUNCTIONS
POD0000005948_S0000399 FARGATE AND LAMBDA I THINK PEOPLE STILL HAVEN'T WITH EXCEPTIONS
POD0000005948_S0000413 THAT'S THE ONLY INTERFACE THAT REALLY SEE THAT'S THE ONLY INTERFACE THAT SHOULD CARE ABOUT
POD0000005948_S0000425 WOULD IT BE EVEN MORE ECONOMICAL IF YOU COULD SCHEDULE THESE BATCH JOBS ON TO LAMBDA
POD0000005948_S0000448 I DO THIN WITH TRADITIONAL BATCH COMPUTING
POD0000005948_S0000466 VISUALIZE KEY METRICS SET ALERTS TO IDENTIFY ANOMALIES AND COLLABORATE WITH YOUR TEAM TO TROUBLESHOOT AND FIX ISSUES FAST
POD0000005948_S0000471 THAT'S SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH DATADOG
POD0000005948_S0000492 A LOT OF THESE KINDS OF APPLICATIONS ARE BEING WRITTEN FOR CONTAINERS AND DEPLOYED INSIDE A CONTAINER ORCHESTRATION SYSTEM
POD0000005948_S0000506 THEY ARE RUN ON E C TWO WHICH COULD ALSO HAVE A SIDECAR PROXY RUNNING IN IT
POD0000005948_S0000520 THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE ENVOY PLUGINS THEY ALL HAVE ENVOY PLUGINS OR IN SOME CASES LIKE X-RAY WE UPSTREAM THE PLUGIN
POD0000005948_S0000534 THEY NEED PERMISSIONS TO TALK TO EACH OTHER THEY NEED POLICIES THAT DEFINE IS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO TALK TO EACH OTHER
POD0000005948_S0000561 NOW YOU'RE APPLYING VERY FIND-GRAINED POLICY AT AN APPLICATION LEVEL
POD0000005948_S0000572 WHERE IS THE ORGANIZATION GOING
POD0000005948_S0000581 HUGE
POD0000005956_S0000010 W S O TWO CREATED THE BALLERINA LANGUAGE AND IS INVESTING HEAVILY INTO IT WITH AROUND EIGHTY PEOPLE WORKING ON BALLERINA AS OF THE PUBLICATION OF THIS EPISODE
POD0000005956_S0000018 YOUR JOB SHOULD REWARD YOU FOR BEING A CONSTANT LEARNER AND HIRED HELPS YOU FIND YOUR DREAM JOB
POD0000005956_S0000025 TO GET THAT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS SIGNING BONUS UPON FINDING A JOB
POD0000005956_S0000059 AND THE ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM IS ABOUT SETTING UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN SUCH A WAY WHERE YOU CAN HANDLE ALL THESE POLICIES THAT YOU'VE GOT
POD0000005956_S0000094 THOSE MICROSERVICES CAN BE DEPLOYABLE IN SOMETHING LIKE CLOUD FOUNDRY OR KUBERNETES
POD0000005956_S0000118 AND THE DEVELOPER WILL WRITE SYNTAX THAT IS AWARE OF ITS ENVIRONMENT
POD0000005956_S0000134 OR YOU'RE A PRODUCT MANAGER DROWNING IN BUG REPORTS
POD0000005956_S0000139 HEAD OVER TO SOFTWAREENGINEERING DAILY DOT COM SLASH RAYGUN
POD0000005956_S0000155 RIGHT
POD0000005956_S0000188 INVOKING SOME VARIABLES
POD0000005956_S0000216 OR IT COULD BE AN ERROR
POD0000005956_S0000250 THEN YEAH BALLERINA IS INTENDED TO BE THAT IT IS A DSL
POD0000005956_S0000260 PACKAGE NAMES VERSIONS AND LICENSES AND THE SNAPSHOT IS SENT EACH TIME THE APPLICATION IS RUN OR A NEW PACKAGE IS LOADED
POD0000005956_S0000281 WE HAVE THESE VERY LONG-LIVED RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM
POD0000005956_S0000312 AND YOU CAN DO MAIN METHODS
POD0000005956_S0000321 IT IDENTIFIES THE BINDING ELEMENT
POD0000005956_S0000340 AND THEN HOW DOES THE BALLERINA MIDDLEWARE TALK TO SERVICE B
POD0000005964_S0000005 THE COMMON MISUNDERSTANDINGS OF BITCOIN AND THE MYTHS OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES
POD0000005964_S0000015 THEY CRAVE LITTLE CARS ZOOMING AROUND ON THE MAP
POD0000005964_S0000020 EMBEDDED INTO HARDWARE AND ANY OTHER DEVICE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET
POD0000005964_S0000034 I THINK IT'S BEEN A FUN TOPIC TO TEACH FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE WELL WHEN I GOT TO PRINCETON WHICH WAS THREE YEARS AGO NOW AS A POST DOC
POD0000005964_S0000052 IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE CONSENSUS LAYER IS PRETTY HARD
POD0000005964_S0000065 THERE ARE NOT THOROUGH PROOFS AROUND THEM OR THERE ARE PROOFS THAT SEEM I GUESS SPECULATIVE
POD0000005964_S0000078 IS IT OKAY IF WE GO IN THAT DIRECTION WITH CRYPTOCURRENCIES
POD0000005964_S0000092 AND THAT DIDN'T HAVE THIS TWENTY ONE MILLION RESTRICTION THAT WAS GOING TO KEEP CREATING NEW UNITS
POD0000005964_S0000106 WHO PRETTY MUCH ALL AGREE THAT YOU WANT SOME SLIGHT CONSTANT INFLATION TO YOUR CURRENCY IT'S A FAIRLY WELL
POD0000005964_S0000129 AS EACH NEW ANALYTICAL TOOL REQUIRES DESIGNING FROM SCRATCH THERE'S A NEW OPEN SOURCE PROJECT CALLED DREMIO THAT IS DESIGNED TO SIMPLIFY ANALYTICS ON ALL THESE SOURCES
POD0000005964_S0000143 THAT'S FINE WHEN THE FACT THAT THEY USE LESS ENERGY IS DEFINITELY A PLUS BUT THEY'RE NOT DIRECT SUBSTITUTE
POD0000005964_S0000161 SO WHY ARE SMART CONTRACTS USEFUL
POD0000005964_S0000196 YEAH I MEAN
POD0000005964_S0000210 I JUST THINK THAT THE MODEL OF SMART CONTRACTS AND A FULLY PROGRAMMABLE BLOCKCHAIN IS A LOT MORE INTERESTING TECHNICALLY IS THIS A BET ON DEVELOPER NETWORK EFFECTS OVER USAGE NETWORK EFFECTS
POD0000005964_S0000227 THINK AGAIN
POD0000005964_S0000274 ARE THEY IMPLEMENTATION BOTTLENECKS OR DO WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF THEORETICAL WORK TO OVERCOME
POD0000005964_S0000299 I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FOCUS MY IMPACT ON TEACHING
POD0000005964_S0000320 YOUR ENTERPRISE PRODUCES LOTS OF DATA
POD0000005964_S0000325 USE THE MAPR ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING ENGINES TO ANALYZE YOUR DATA IN BATCH OR INTERACTIVELY ACROSS ANY CLOUD ON PREMISE OR AT THE EDGE MAPR'S TECHNOLOGY IS TRUSTED BY MAJOR INDUSTRIES LIKE AUDI WHICH USES MAPR TO ACCELERATE DEEP LEARNING IN AUTONOMOUS DRIVING APPLICATIONS
POD0000005964_S0000331 OR A MAJOR FINTECH PROVIDER LIKE KABBAGE
POD0000005972_S0000006 SO WHEN KUBERNETES ARRIVED IT PROVIDED AN OUT-OF-THE-BOX TOOL FOR MANAGING INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE GOOGLE WOULD
POD0000005972_S0000013 ELIMINATE THE COMPLICATED PLANNING AND DEPLOYMENT OF FULLY ORCHESTRATED CONTAINERIZED APPLICATIONS WITH KUBERNETES
POD0000005972_S0000018 ALSO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY SCALE TO MAXIMIZE YOUR RESOURCE UTILIZATION WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE YOUR APPLICATIONS OFF-LINE
POD0000005972_S0000031 YOU MENTIONED ALL THESE DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT ARE GOING TO BE TOUCHED
POD0000005972_S0000068 TO HAVE THIS KIND OF LAYER IN BETWEEN DEVELOPERS AND THE CONTAINERS RUNNING THEMSELVES
POD0000005972_S0000091 LITERALLY MANY MEMBERS OF THE TEAM OF BORG ITSELF BORG AND OMEGA
POD0000005972_S0000106 THIS YEAR DIGITALOCEAN IS MAKING THAT EVEN EASIER WITH NEW NODE TYPES
POD0000005972_S0000115 YOU CAN USE THE CREDIT FOR HOSTING OR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT INCLUDES LOAD BALANCERS OBJECT STORAGE DIGITALOCEAN SPACES IS A GREAT NEW PRODUCT THAT PROVIDES OBJECT STORAGE AND OF COURSE COMPUTATION
POD0000005972_S0000127 ON TOP OF THAT NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE GOOGLE BEHIND IT
POD0000005972_S0000144 BUT THEN YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOUR CURRENT STATE IS AND IF YOU NEED TO LAUNCH A NEW ENVIRONMENT FROM SCRATCH THAT REPLICATES FOR ENVIRONMENT
POD0000005972_S0000163 WE'RE GOING TO REALLY START TO PUT SOME PRODUCTION STUFF ON HERE
POD0000005972_S0000180 BUILD AN IMAGE PUSH THAT IMAGE TO A REPOSITORY
POD0000005972_S0000185 NOW THAT APP CONF WE DIDN'T HAVE A WAY ON DAY ONE OF PULLING THAT DOWN AND EXPOSING IT TO THE SERVICE
POD0000005972_S0000205 THERE ARE SOME TECHNICAL PEOPLE IN YOUR COMPANY WHO HAVE TIME TO BUILD APPS
POD0000005972_S0000211 DOES YOUR BANK NEED A SIMPLE MOBILE APP FOR MOBILE BANKING TRANSACTIONS
POD0000005972_S0000226 BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY HAVING A SINGLE KERNEL THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TARGETING IS PRETTY POWERFUL
POD0000005972_S0000256 THE FEWER INTERFACES I HAVE TO TARGET AND TO MAINTAIN AND MANAGE
POD0000005972_S0000295 IF YOU ARE BUILDING A PRODUCT FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS OR YOU ARE HIRING SOFTWARE ENGINEERS
POD0000005972_S0000304 THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH BUT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN TAKING YOUR SUPPORT OF THE SHOW TO THE NEXT LEVEL
POD0000005980_S0000011 YOUR JOB SHOULD REWARD YOU FOR BEING A CONSTANT LEARNER
POD0000005980_S0000016 FROM STARTUPS TO LARGE PUBLIC COMPANIES
POD0000005980_S0000025 YOU CAN REFER THEM TO HIRED AND GET A ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS BONUS
POD0000005980_S0000042 IN AN INFLATIONARY ECONOMY WHERE THINGS ARE CHANGING EVERY DAY
POD0000005980_S0000061 MOST OF THESE CHALLENGER BANKS AND I THINK THOSE ARE CHALLENGER BANKS NOT NECESSARILY FIN TECHS
POD0000005980_S0000073 YOU GET DATA THAT YOU CAN USE TO CORRELATE WITH CREDIT OUTCOMES
POD0000005980_S0000089 THE FIRST CRITICAL MILESTONE THAT WE HAD WAS INTEGRATION WITH MASTERCARD
POD0000005980_S0000105 ANOTHER ONE WAS SIZING CERTAIN SERVICES RIGHT WE MADE A SERVICE CALLED ACCOUNTS AND IT DID ACCOUNTS RIGHT
POD0000005980_S0000119 AN EASY WAY TO INVEST IN LARGE SCALE SOLAR ENERGY PROJECTS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES
POD0000005980_S0000134 WITH THAT CAVEAT
POD0000005980_S0000148 PARTIALLY BECAUSE WE WERE NAIVE AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW BIG THAT MONSTER WAS TO REALLY REWRITE IT RIGHT
POD0000005980_S0000166 EVEN IF THEY DON'T FULLY PULL IT OFF
POD0000005980_S0000187 IN THROUGH KAFKA OUT THROUGH HTTP INTO THE DATABASE AND BACK OUT
POD0000005980_S0000200 KAFKA BEING OUR MAIN ASYNCHRONOUS I O
POD0000005980_S0000225 WHAT WOULD YOU USE KAFKA STREAMS FOR AND DESCRIBE WHAT KAFKA STREAMS ALLOW YOU TO DO
POD0000005980_S0000240 PLURALSIGHT IS A PERSONALIZED LEARNING EXPERIENCE THAT HELPS YOU KEEP PACE
POD0000005980_S0000263 AND THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY
POD0000005980_S0000290 THE ONE ON ONES AND THE SOFT SKILL STYLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE A MANAGER
POD0000005980_S0000323 YOU REALLY MAKE THAT A VIABLE STRATEGY RIGHT
POD0000005980_S0000357 YOU CHOSE POSTGRES BECAUSE YOU TRUST IT
POD0000005980_S0000362 CITUS CAN PARALLELIZE YOUR SQL QUERIES ACROSS MULTIPLE NODES DRAMATICALLY SPEEDING THEM UP AND GIVING YOU MUCH LOWER LATENCY
POD0000005988_S0000004 MUCH LIKE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS HAVE DIFFERENT CULTURES AND FOCUS ON DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES
POD0000005988_S0000009 FINDCOLLABS IS THE COMPANY I'M WORKING ON
POD0000005988_S0000016 IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO START A PODCAST
POD0000005988_S0000023 AND WE DON'T LIKE DOING WHITEBOARD PROBLEMS AND WORKING ON TEDIOUS TAKE HOME PROJECTS
POD0000005988_S0000028 TRIPLEBYTE WORKS WITH FOUR HUNDRED PLUS TECH COMPANIES
POD0000005988_S0000037 TRIPLEBYTE DOES NOT LOOK AT CANDIDATE'S BACKGROUNDS LIKE RESUMES AND WHERE THEY'VE WORKED AND WHERE THEY WENT TO SCHOOL
POD0000005988_S0000044 THANK YOU TO TRIPLEBYTE
POD0000005988_S0000064 AND VOCATION SCHOOL HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND AUTOMATION IS SOMETHING THAT HAS PERSISTED OVERTIME
POD0000005988_S0000081 LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THE OUTCOME LET'S ASSUME I CAN PAY FOR MY BOOT CAMP AND I CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT BOOT CAMPS THAT I GO TO
POD0000005988_S0000089 THE SKILLSET TO GET A JOB IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE SKILLSET TO LEARN HOW TO CODE
POD0000005988_S0000100 YEAH I THINK THE OTHER BIG FACTOR THAT AT LEAST WHEN I WAS DOING THE JOB SEARCH AFTER THE BOOT CAMP IS JUST THE IMPOSTER SYNDROME LIKE THE SELF-DOUBT YOU FEEL
POD0000005988_S0000122 OVER A HUNDRED EPISODES I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT ALL THREE OF YOU AT THIS POINT I BELIEVE HAVE LEFT THE JOBS THAT YOU WERE WORKING AT THE COMPANIES THAT YOU WERE WORKING AT
POD0000005988_S0000127 BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WANTED TO START WE HAD IDEAS
POD0000005988_S0000136 RADIO IS REALLY POWERFUL
POD0000005988_S0000158 LIKE SINGLE PARENTS PEOPLE THAT HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS ATHLETES VETERANS
POD0000005988_S0000184 AND THEN MATCH IT UP WITH WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING IN THE WORLD
POD0000005988_S0000194 IF YOU WANT TO INNOVATE IN THE WORLD OF CAR BUYING SELLING AND OWNERSHIP
POD0000005988_S0000199 THANKS TO COX AUTOMOTIVE
POD0000005988_S0000205 PROSPECTIVE BOOT CAMP ATTENDEES
POD0000005988_S0000218 SO ONCE YOU HAVE DECIDED THAT YOU WANT TO GET INTO THIS PROGRAM OR THESE PROGRAMS
POD0000005988_S0000230 THEY ARE PUT INTO SOMETHING THAT WE CALL A SQUAD THAT IS ESSENTIALLY ACCOUNTABILITY BUDDY AND THEY CAN DECIDE WHO'S INSIDE OF THOSE SQUADS USUALLY IT'S FIVE TO TWENTY PEOPLE
POD0000005988_S0000241 MOST OF THE CURRICULUM ONLINE IS GEARED TOWARDS THE VERY VERY BASICS
POD0000005988_S0000268 ABOUT THREE MONTHS FOR THE JOB SEARCH
POD0000005988_S0000280 BEING WITH OTHER VETERANS THAT KNOW HOW TO DO THAT CAN DO IT WAY BETTER THAN WE DO
POD0000005988_S0000297 I'M SURPRISED IT HASN'T CAUGHT ON MORE
POD0000005988_S0000316 LEARN HOW TO CODE
POD0000005988_S0000334 WHY IS THERE PUSHBACK AGAINST THE LEARN TO CODE MOVEMENT
POD0000005988_S0000351 YOU WILL LITERALLY SEE EVERY FIVE MINUTES SOMEONE TWEETING ABOUT WHAT THEY LEARNED THAT DAY
POD0000005988_S0000366 IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT
POD0000005988_S0000395 GOOD QUESTION
POD0000005988_S0000409 YOU KNOW WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET ACCEPTED
POD0000005988_S0000428 I STARTED TO LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO I COULD START A BUSINESS WITH
POD0000005988_S0000435 THAT'S WHY I STARTED FINDCOLLABS
POD0000005988_S0000440 LIKE CRYPTOCURRENCIES OR REACT OR KUBERNETES OR VUE JS
POD0000005988_S0000446 I'D ALSO LOVE IF YOU CHECK OUT WHAT I'M BUILDING MAYBE YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN WORKING ON IT WITH ME
POD0000005988_S0000456 I'M GOING TO BECOME A SOFTWARE ENGINEER THIS YEAR
POD0000005988_S0000470 THAT ACTUALLY BECOMES JUSTIFICATION OF TRUTH
POD0000005988_S0000476 WANTING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
POD0000005988_S0000486 THEY CAN AMPLIFY THEIR VOICE THROUGH OUR MEDIA NETWORK
POD0000005988_S0000499 I'M GOING TO CREATE THIS AMAZING FIVE-MINUTE VIDEO AND I'M GOING TO PUT IT OUT THERE AND I'M GOING TO GET THOUSANDS OF VIEWS THE NEXT DAY
POD0000005988_S0000520 WE INTERVIEW OTHER PEOPLE THAN KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN US
POD0000005988_S0000540 WE BELIEVE THE BEST SOLUTION TO PODCASTING WILL BE OPEN SOURCE
POD0000005988_S0000546 AND WE WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOU GET STARTED WITH YOUR PODCAST
POD0000005988_S0000551 AND YOU CAN REACH US AT ANY TIME BY EMAILING HELP AT PODSHEETS DOT COM
POD0000005996_S0000005 LYFT DRIVERS DOORDASH FOOD DELIVERY PEOPLE
POD0000005996_S0000010 WE WANT SOME GUARANTEES ABOUT THEIR REPUTATION
POD0000005996_S0000021 OPENSHIFT IS A KUBERNETES PLATFORM FROM RED HAT
POD0000005996_S0000027 OPENSHIFT FROM RED HAT GIVES YOU KUBERNETES WITHOUT THE COMPLICATION
POD0000005996_S0000032 WHETHER YOU'RE AN ENGINEER AT A LARGE ENTERPRISE OR A DEVELOPER GETTING YOUR STARTUP OFF THE GROUND

POD0000005996_S0000075 AND THEY EMAIL THEIR PREFERRED BACKGROUND CHECK COMPANY
POD0000005996_S0000089 BUT THEY HELP YOUR INTERNAL PEOPLE WORK MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN AT THE LEGACY COMPANIES
POD0000005996_S0000114 OR FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF CASES WHERE IT'S MORE SEVERE CHARGES THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HAVE EXTRA LEVELS OF SCRUTINY
POD0000005996_S0000127 YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE EVERYWHERE
POD0000005996_S0000132 YOU CAN USE TRANSIFEX WITH IN-HOUSE TRANSLATION TEAMS LANGUAGE SERVICE PROVIDERS
POD0000005996_S0000139 WHETHER YOU ARE TRANSLATING A WEBSITE A GAME A MOBILE APP OR EVEN VIDEO SUBTITLES
POD0000005996_S0000170 THAT CAN BE A VERY DISCOURAGING SITUATION TO BE IN AND YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT THERE IS A DOZEN OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WHERE YOUR BACKGROUND IS ACTUALLY A FIT FOR AND WOULDN'T PREVENT YOU FROM HAVING AN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
POD0000005996_S0000192 YOU WOULD DEFINITELY SOLVE SOME PART OF THE QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED
POD0000005996_S0000199 WHAT IS THE PRODUCT TO BUILD
POD0000005996_S0000226 THEY SHOULD DO THAT THAT'S GREAT
POD0000005996_S0000257 AND IT MAKES IT SO THAT THEY MAKE MORE CONSISTENT DECISIONS AROUND THE THINGS THAT AREN'T IMPORTANT
POD0000005996_S0000273 MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE FINDING OUT ABOUT DIGITALOCEAN AND REALIZING THAT DIGITALOCEAN IS PERFECT FOR THEIR APPLICATION WORKLOADS
POD0000005996_S0000282 YOU CAN MAKE A HUNDRED DOLLARS GO PRETTY FAR ON DIGITALOCEAN
POD0000005996_S0000299 WE'RE ABLE TO PUSH THAT INTO THE FEED OF THE DYNAMIC CHECK SO THAT INFORMATION IT'S PROCESSED REAL TIME
POD0000005996_S0000316 AND MAYBE TO SOME EXTENT IT IS
POD0000005996_S0000354 AND THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTING PROBLEMS IN HERE THAT GET INTO THE TECHNOLOGY THE MISSION POWERING EMPLOYMENT EVEN THINGS LIKE TENANT SCREENING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON
POD0000005996_S0000365 BUT DEBUGGING IS AN UNAVOIDABLE PART OF MOST DEVELOPERS' LIVES
POD0000005996_S0000371 AND WITH THE DEBUGGER YOU OFTEN AREN'T TESTING THE CODE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT YOU'RE TESTING IT ON YOUR OWN MACHINE OR IN A STAGING SERVER
POD0000005996_S0000376 YOU CAN INSERT THESE NONBREAKING BREAKPOINTS ON THE FLY
POD0000006004_S0000013 TRY IT YOURSELF BY STARTING A FREE FOURTEEN DAY TRIAL TODAY
POD0000006004_S0000030 OKAY LET'S SAY I HAVE STARTED A COMPANY IT'S A PHOTO-SHARING APP
POD0000006004_S0000039 THIS WILL YIELD OPTIMIZATIONS AS FAR AS COST IS CONCERNED
POD0000006004_S0000062 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COST TRADEOFFS FOR STORAGE
POD0000006004_S0000093 MANIFOLD MAKES YOUR LIFE EASIER BY PROVIDING A SINGLE WORKFLOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR SERVICES
POD0000006004_S0000099 WHICH I THINK CAN BE REALLY PRODUCTIVE FOR ALLOWING YOU TO BUILD AND LEVERAGE YOUR CREATIVITY FASTER
POD0000006004_S0000106 OR PROJECT
POD0000006004_S0000127 NORMALLY IT COME BY THE WAY JUST TO COMPLETE THAT POINT WHEN CUSTOMERS OPT TO MANAGED SERVICES ON THEIR OWN IT'S COMING DUE TO A LACK OF FUNCTIONALITY
POD0000006004_S0000138 BUT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT THE INPUTS AND OUTPUTS OF A BUSINESS
POD0000006004_S0000168 FULL DISCLOSURE YOU'RE A SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
POD0000006004_S0000193 BECAUSE IF YOU ADVICE YOUR CUSTOMER IN A CERTAIN ARCHITECTURE
POD0000006004_S0000204 TRIPLEBYTE TAKES ENGINEERS SERIOUSLY AND DOES NOT WASTE THEIR TIME
POD0000006004_S0000237 YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU WORK
POD0000006004_S0000268 BUT THEN AS THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING BECAME MORE COMPLEX
POD0000006004_S0000296 WITH OPENSHIFT YOU CAN AVOID BEING LOCKED INTO ANY OF THE PARTICULAR LARGE CLOUD PROVIDERS
POD0000006004_S0000301 YOU CAN FOCUS ON YOUR APPLICATION INSTEAD OF COMPLEX KUBERNETES ISSUES
POD0000006004_S0000307 IT WAS MEANT AS A LOWER LEVEL INFRASTRUCTURE PIECE TO BUILD PLATFORMS AS A SERVICE ON TOP OF
POD0000006012_S0000006 THERE ARE NO WAITERS
POD0000006012_S0000013 ASHLEY JOINS THE SHOW TO TALK ABOUT THE DYNAMICS OF VIRTUAL RESTAURANTS AND THE CLOUD KITCHEN INDUSTRY
POD0000006012_S0000022 EVERY BUSINESS NEEDS INTERNAL TOOLS
POD0000006012_S0000032 I'VE HEARD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ABOUT RETOOL FROM ENGINEERS WHO I RESPECT
POD0000006012_S0000050 WHICH IS JUST A CENTRALIZED LOCATION FOR MASS FOOD PRODUCTION
POD0000006012_S0000067 WHAT'S REQUIRED TO SET UP A VIRTUAL RESTAURANT FOR ME
POD0000006012_S0000094 GAUGE SUPPORTS SPECIFI CATIONS IN MARKDOWN
POD0000006012_S0000100 TOGETHER GAUGE AND TAIKO REDUCE THE PAIN AND INCREASE THE RELIABILITY OF TEST AUTOMATION
POD0000006012_S0000135 WE ALSO HAVE THE SOFTWARE THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK
POD0000006012_S0000150 BEVERAGE PRODUCERS ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT FOOD ENTREPRENEURS THAT NEED ACCESS TO THESE COMMERCIAL SPACES
POD0000006012_S0000188 VISUALIZE KEY METRICS SET ALERTS TO IDENTIFY ANOMALIES
POD0000006012_S0000195 BUT WE CAN MAKE SOME GUESSES BASED ON THE ACTIONS OF LARGER CORPORATE PLAYERS AND PEOPLE WHO'VE GOTTEN FUNDED SIGNIFI CANTLY SUCH AS THE CLOUD KITCHENS COMPANY
POD0000006012_S0000210 YEAH
POD0000006012_S0000240 DOES IT SURPRISE YOU AT ALL THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A HIGHLY DEVELOPED SECONDHAND FOOD MARKET
POD0000006012_S0000268 LIKE ME
POD0000006012_S0000274 THESE ARE ENGINEERS WHO KNOW ABOUT THE REACT ECOSYSTEM ABOUT THE MOBILE ECOSYSTEM ABOUT GRAPHQL REACT NATIVE
POD0000006020_S0000003 MANY SEARCH APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN BUILT ON ELASTICSEARCH AN OPEN SOURCE DISTRIBUTED SEARCH ENGINE ELASTICSEARCH IS THE CODE THAT POWERS SOME SEARCH AS A SERVICE PRODUCTS OFFERED BY MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDERS
POD0000006020_S0000010 MACHINE LEARNING CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE ARE SEARCHING ACROSS YOUR SEARCH INDEX AND TO OPTIMIZE THE SEARCH INDEX TO INCORPORATE THOSE USER PREFERENCES LIAM CAVANAGH IS THE PRINCIPAL PROGRAM MANAGER ON AZURE SEARCH HE JOINS THE SHOW TO TALK ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF A SEARCH INDEX
POD0000006020_S0000018 THOUGH I'VE GOTTEN BETTER AT TALKING ABOUT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING I HAVE DEFINITELY GOTTEN WORSE AT ACTUALLY WRITING CODE AND DOING SOFTWARE ENGINEERING MYSELF
POD0000006020_S0000030 AND UNLIKE SQL WHERE YOU WOULD DO A SQL QUERY TYPICALLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING AGAINST IN AN INDEX IS THEY'RE DOING WHAT'S CALLED A FULL-TEXT SEARCH
POD0000006020_S0000039 BUT TRADITIONALLY THERE'S A LOT OF METADATA THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH IT THAT IS VERY VERY EFFECTIVE
POD0000006020_S0000053 THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME STEP IN THE SEARCH INDEX INGESTION PROCESS WHERE TEXT METADATA AROUND THOSE ENTITIES NEEDS TO BE CREATED
POD0000006020_S0000069 COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BUILDING A SEARCH INDEX FOR UNSTRUCTURED DOCUMENTS VERSUS BUILDING A SEARCH INDEX FOR STRUCTURED DATA
POD0000006020_S0000084 TRYING TO DO YOUR BEST TO GET MEANING
POD0000006020_S0000092 SO THAT WHENEVER YOU QUERY YOU NEED TO PASS IN THE KEY SO THAT YOU CAN AUTHENTICATE AND GET THE PROPER RESULTS BACK AS NEEDED
POD0000006020_S0000107 I WANT TO QUERY THIS INDEX AS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT'S A PLACE THAT WE STORE THE DATA
POD0000006020_S0000124 A FIFTEEN DOLLARS FLEXIBLE DROPLET THAT CAN MIX AND MATCH DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS OF CPU AND RAM TO GET THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES FOR YOUR APPLICATION
POD0000006020_S0000149 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID DO IS THROUGH BING
POD0000006020_S0000187 HERE ARE THE SIMILARITIES THAT I AM SEEING
POD0000006020_S0000203 DATADOG INTEGRATES SEAMLESSLY WITH CONTAINER TECHNOLOGIES LIKE DOCKER AND KUBERNETES
POD0000006020_S0000210 THAT'S SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH DATADOG THANK YOU DATADOG
POD0000006020_S0000221 THEY DON'T SEE THAT THERE IS AN ELASTICSEARCH SERVICE THEY DON'T SEE THAT THERE ARE VMS THAT'S CREATED ON THEIR BEHALF
POD0000006020_S0000227 WE ARE PURELY USING AZURE TECHNOLOGIES WHETHER IT'S AZURE VMS WE'RE USING THE BLOB STORAGE
POD0000006020_S0000246 WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING TO ME AT THE START
POD0000006020_S0000263 PROBABLY NOT
POD0000006020_S0000282 ONE IS IN THE AREA OF WHAT WE CALL A CUSTOM-NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION
POD0000006020_S0000293 WE'VE ACTUALLY STARTED USING MACHINE LEARNING SPECIFICALLY NEURAL NETS
POD0000006020_S0000300 ISOLATE YOUR APPLICATION FROM INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES AND TRANSPARENTLY SCALE THE UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE TO MEET GROWING DEMANDS
POD0000006028_S0000007 A COLLABORATIVE SQL EXPLORER
POD0000006028_S0000014 X-TEAM IS ABLE TO SUPPORT A WIDE RANGE OF NEEDS
POD0000006028_S0000020 THEY OFFER FLEXIBLE OPTIONS IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO GROW YOUR TEAM EFFICIENTLY
POD0000006028_S0000028 YOU'RE THE FOUNDER OF POPSQL
POD0000006028_S0000047 I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY HOW SQL IS USED ANYMORE I THINK NOW YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCESSING SQL DATABASES BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING TRANSACTIONAL OPERATIONS LIKE PEOPLE THAT ARE BUILDING MICROSERVICES THAT ACTUALLY SERVE A BUSINESS FUNCTION
POD0000006028_S0000073 THE OTHER USE CASES FOR PEOPLE WANTING TO DO ANALYTICS
POD0000006028_S0000092 OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ARE LIKE SNIPPETS
POD0000006028_S0000103 EVEN CONNECTING TO THE DATABASE IS DIFFICULT
POD0000006028_S0000119 YOU MAY NOT HAVE SPENT MUCH TIME LEARNING ABOUT BUSINESS SOFTWARE
POD0000006028_S0000126 NETSUITE CAN GIVE YOU THE TOOLS TO HELP CHARGE YOUR GROWTH
POD0000006028_S0000140 FOR EXAMPLE
POD0000006028_S0000152 I THINK GOOGLE SHEETS DOES THIS REALLY WELL
POD0000006028_S0000170 THEN THAT'S A GREAT CANDIDATE FOR THE DESKTOP APP
POD0000006028_S0000182 YOU CAN BUILD CHARTS IN THE APP
POD0000006028_S0000214 JUST LIKE GOOGLE DOCS
POD0000006028_S0000228 THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE UNDERLYING QUERY
POD0000006028_S0000240 YOU CAN TRY OUT DIFFERENT THINGS AND THERE'S ALSO DATA VISUALIZATION SO USERS CAN MAKE DASHBOARDS IN POPSQL
POD0000006028_S0000261 HOW ARE THOSE QUERIES GETTING ROUTED TO THE ACTUAL DATABASE THAT THE USER IS CONNECTED TO DOES IT HAVE TO GO THROUGH YOUR BACKEND OR DOES IT GO DIRECTLY TO THEIR DATABASE
POD0000006028_S0000273 SO YOU CAN USE OCTA TO CONNECT TO SNOWFLAKE
POD0000006028_S0000282 AND THAT BRINGS TO MIND THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE ABILITY TO CONNECT TO SO MANY DIFFERENT SQL INTERFACES I MEAN YOU GOT POSTGRES
POD0000006028_S0000288 ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE TWO DIFFERENT WAYS OF CONNECTING
POD0000006028_S0000299 BUT MAYBE GET ME A LIST OF MATERIALIZED VIEWS MAYBE THAT CHANGES MAYBE THE QUERY FOR THAT HAS CHANGED
POD0000006028_S0000340 THE ERROR REPORTING BETTER BE GOOD
POD0000006028_S0000357 AND TODAY F FIVE CLOUD SERVICES PROVIDES GLOBAL DNS INFRASTRUCTURE FOR LIGHTNING FAST ACCESS AROUND THE WORLD
POD0000006028_S0000368 BUT FOR SOME REASON THEIR SCHEMA IS NOT LOADING
POD0000006028_S0000389 CAN YOU EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL HOW ENGINEERS WANT TO COLLABORATE IN A SQL EDITOR LIKE THIS
POD0000006028_S0000410 WE'RE PRETTY BULLISH ON NOTEBOOKS
POD0000006028_S0000449 BUT NOW THE GYM IS CLOSED AND OBVIOUSLY I CAN MEET THE TRAINER
POD0000006028_S0000460 AWESOME
POD0000006036_S0000010 DOES YOUR BANK NEED A SIMPLE MOBILE APP FOR MOBILE BANKING TRANSACTIONS
POD0000006036_S0000045 WHAT ARE SOME OF THE DESIGN DECISIONS THAT SOMEBODY HAS TO MAKE WHEN THEY ARE ARCHITECTING ONE OF THESE CONTAINER PLATFORM SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE SEEN SEVERAL OF OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS
POD0000006036_S0000070 ISOLATE YOUR APPLICATION FROM INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES AND TRANSPARENTLY SCALE THE UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE TO MEET GROWING DEMANDS ALL WHILE INCREASING THE SECURITY RELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF CRITICAL BUSINESS WORKLOADS WITH AZURE
POD0000006036_S0000111 IT'S ALL THREE OF THOSE THINGS RIGHT THE INFRASTRUCTURE'S INVISIBLE IT'S MICRO BUILT AND IT'S EVENT BASED PROGRAMMING MODEL RIGHT
POD0000006036_S0000151 FAKE ACCOUNTS OR USER GENERATED CONTENT PROBLEMS LIKE SPAM
POD0000006036_S0000168 IN PRACTICE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE CONTROL PLANE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE TRUST YOU KNOW PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE FAULT DOMAINS FOR THE CONTROL PLANE FOR THAT CLUSTER SO FOR EXAMPLE
POD0000006044_S0000011 I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS EPISODE WITH OREN
POD0000006044_S0000019 LOGROCKET ALSO RECORDS CONSOLE LOGS JAVASCRIPT ERRORS
POD0000006044_S0000025 QUICKLY UNDERSTAND YOUR BUGS AND FIX THEM WITH LOGROCKET
POD0000006044_S0000047 SO TODAY YOU HAVE CLICK STREAMS OF DATA OR FAST INCOMING DATA ABOUT SENSORS FROM A SELF-DRIVING CAR
POD0000006044_S0000061 I MEAN I SAID DUMB BUT THERE'RE TONS OF SMARTS IN THERE THAT COULD READ THE METADATA COMING IN OFF OF THE DATA TYPE AND JUST PROVIDE ALL THESE FUNCTIONALITY
POD0000006044_S0000085 IT WAS SCARY
POD0000006044_S0000103 THAT'S A TOUGH ONE BECAUSE I'D NEVER REALLY SAW IT FROM THE REGULATION PERSPECTIVE
POD0000006044_S0000121 OH DEFINITELY
POD0000006044_S0000138 I AM WAY MORE PRODUCTIVE WORKING AT HOME BECAUSE I CAN GET INTO MY LIKE FRAME OF MIND NOBODY COMES BY TO BOTHER ME
POD0000006044_S0000154 AND IN BETWEEN THE TALKS I HANG OUT AND EAT SOME MIXED NUTS CHAT WITH OTHER ENGINEERING LEADERSHIP ABOUT THE LATEST TALKS AND STUFF THAT THEY'RE SEEING
POD0000006044_S0000159 ITS TECHNICAL A LOT OF IT IS ALSO CULTURAL AND ABOUT MANAGEMENT
POD0000006044_S0000174 OR WHATEVER IT SEEMS LIKE LOTS OF YAK SHAVING
POD0000006044_S0000182 AND THESE ARE TOOLS THAT I KNEW VERY VERY WELL INSIDE AND OUT
POD0000006044_S0000203 NOW THEY NEED TO TAKE IT TO THAT NEXT LEVEL AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'VE ENGAGED BLUE METAL AND INSIGHT HELP DO THAT
POD0000006044_S0000212 THAT WAS CERTAINLY A BIG PART OF IT
POD0000006044_S0000242 PARTY ON
POD0000006044_S0000267 I THINK IT'S ALL THERE ARE SIMILARITIES AND THERE ARE DIFFERENCES
POD0000006044_S0000292 BUT IF YOU'RE DOING SIX OTHER THINGS LIKE
POD0000006044_S0000303 I THINK THERE CAN BE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS AROUND SUPPORT FOR PROJECTS THAT
POD0000006044_S0000329 MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE FINDING OUT ABOUT DIGITALOCEAN AND REALIZING THAT DIGITALOCEAN IS PERFECT FOR THEIR APPLICATION WORKLOADS
POD0000006044_S0000338 YOU CAN MAKE A HUNDRED DOLLARS GO PRETTY FAR ON DIGITALOCEAN
POD0000006044_S0000346 NODE JS IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE THESE ARE OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS THAT HAVE MASSIVE TRACTION
POD0000006044_S0000364 ARE YOU SIGNING YOUR CODE WITH AUTHENTIC CODE
POD0000006044_S0000382 SO IT'S ONE THING TO SAY WELL
POD0000006044_S0000390 YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THAT RUNNING ON A MACHINE BEHIND YOUR FIREWALL IN YOUR NETWORK
POD0000006044_S0000401 EVENTUALLY THEY MAY OR MAY NOT LOOK AT IT
POD0000006044_S0000414 I MEAN IF IT DOESN'T BUILD OR THE TEST FAIL STOP RIGHT THERE
POD0000006044_S0000425 BEING ABLE TO TEST THE CODE IN AS MANY DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS AS POSSIBLE IS REALLY IMPORTANT
POD0000006044_S0000450 ALL OF THE POPULAR SIGNING FORMATS WHERE THE CERTIFICATE IS STORED IN AZURE KEY VAULTS HARDWARE SECURITY MODULE FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY
POD0000006044_S0000478 TRANSIFEX IS A SAAS BASED LOCALIZATION AND TRANSLATION PLATFORM THAT EASILY INTEGRATES WITH YOUR AGILE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
POD0000006044_S0000484 WITH TRANSIFEX SOURCE CONTENT AND TRANSLATIONS ARE AUTOMATICALLY SYNCED TO A GLOBAL CONTENT REPOSITORY THAT'S ACCESSIBLE AT ANY TIME
POD0000006052_S0000007 BUT ORCHESTRATING THEM TOGETHER TO BUILD DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS WAS STILL VERY HARD
POD0000006052_S0000013 THESE TOOLS ARE INVALUABLE BECAUSE THEY ALLOW A DEVELOPER TO QUICKLY BUILD APPLICATIONS ON TOP OF DURABLE
POD0000006052_S0000018 HOW DO YOU MANAGE RESOURCES ACROSS MULTIPLE CLOUDS
POD0000006052_S0000031 AND AS ALWAYS YOU CAN FIND ALL OF OUR OLD EPISODES BY DOWNLOADING THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY APP FOR IOS OR ANDROID
POD0000006052_S0000052 THEN YOU SHOULD PRETTY MUCH GO WITH THESE MANAGED SERVICES BECAUSE YOU JUST GET MORE FLEXIBILITY YOU GET TO MOVE FASTER
POD0000006052_S0000084 THERE ARE SOME COMPANIES THAT OFFER WAYS TO CONNECT ACROSS CLOUDS THAT ARE NOT JUST THROUGH PUBLIC INTERNET BUT THE MOST COMMON ONE IS JUST THROUGH THE PUBLIC INTERNET
POD0000006052_S0000098 FULLSTORY ALLOWS YOU TO RECORD AND REPRODUCE REAL USER EXPERIENCES ON YOUR SITE
POD0000006052_S0000105 THIS FREE TRIAL DOUBLES THE REGULAR FOURTEEN DAY TRIAL AVAILABLE FROM FULLSTORY DOT COM
POD0000006052_S0000112 GET TO KNOW YOUR USERS WITH FULLSTORY
POD0000006052_S0000136 RIGHT SO WE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN OUR LAST SHOW WE DID A PRETTY DEEP DIVE INTO ROOK
POD0000006052_S0000162 SO I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY TRUE AT MOST COMPANIES THAT ARE ADAPTING KUBERNETES
POD0000006052_S0000180 BECAUSE YOU GET ESSENTIALLY A SINGLE CONTROL PLANE THAT'S ABLE TO CONTROL MULTIPLE SO YOU COULD DO THINGS LIKE
POD0000006052_S0000205 SO CROSSPLANE THIS CONTROL PLANE FOR MULTIPLE CLOUDS
POD0000006052_S0000224 FOR YOUR PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO REACH THESE NEW MARKETS YOU'LL NEED A RELIABLE SOLUTION TO LOCALIZE YOUR DIGITAL CONTENT QUICKLY
POD0000006052_S0000231 WITH TRANSIFEX SOURCE CONTENT AND TRANSLATIONS ARE AUTOMATICALLY SYNCED TO A GLOBAL CONTENT REPOSITORY THAT'S ACCESSIBLE AT ANY TIME
POD0000006052_S0000241 YOU CAN PROVISION IT THROUGH CROSSPLANE
POD0000006052_S0000260 THAT THE DECISION TO USE AURORA OR THE DECISION TO USE VITESS OR THE DECISION TO USE MYSQL SHOULD BE A LAID-BOUND RUNTIME LEVEL DECISION NOT DEV TIME ENGINEERING DECISION
POD0000006052_S0000277 I'VE GOT AN APPLICATION LET'S SAY IT'S WORDPRESS
POD0000006052_S0000302 BUT YOU'LL BE PROVISIONING THESE THINGS THAT TODAY ARE A REAL PAIN TO STITCH TOGETHER CORRECT
POD0000006060_S0000005 ADWARE SERVES YOU RANDOM POPUP ADS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE
POD0000006060_S0000011 CLOUD PROVIDERS THEMSELVES ARE VERY SECURE
POD0000006060_S0000017 MY COSTS COULD SHOOT UP
POD0000006060_S0000022 AN UPDATE ON FINDCOLLABS THE NEW COMPANY THAT I'M STARTING
POD0000006060_S0000028 THERE ARE ALSO RUNNER UP PRIZES AND THE WINNERS WILL APPEAR ON SE DAILY TO TALK ABOUT THEIR PROJECTS
POD0000006060_S0000033 THE HACKATHON WILL RUN UNTIL APRIL FOURTEENTH AT MIDNIGHT
POD0000006060_S0000038 FINDCOLLABS IS A PLATFORM FOR ONLINE COLLABORATION AND IT WAS BUILT FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU THE PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
POD0000006060_S0000043 HASEEB HAS BEEN A FREQUENTLY REQUESTED GUEST TO COME BACK ON THE SHOW
POD0000006060_S0000051 YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOUR SYSTEM WILL BREAK BUT YOU KNOW IT WILL HAPPEN
POD0000006060_S0000056 TERMINATE PROCESSES AND HOSTS
POD0000006060_S0000065 OTHER TYPES OF MALWARE COULD BE WORMS WHICH ARE THE ONE THAT PROPAGATES THROUGH A WI-FI NETWORK
POD0000006060_S0000075 BUT THREATS ARE EVOLVING AND CRYPTOJACKING IS A CLEAR CASE OF THAT
POD0000006060_S0000100 WHEN THIS HAPPENS TO US MORE BUSINESS IN THE U S
POD0000006060_S0000114 BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ACTOR IN THIS WHOLE ECOSYSTEM THAT SUFFERS THE MOST WHEN A CRYPTOJACKING SCRIPT IS DEPLOYED
POD0000006060_S0000135 AND WE'RE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATIONS
POD0000006060_S0000140 USERS CAN HAVE A MORE TRANSPARENT IDENTITY SYSTEM RATHER THAN THE MODERN INTERNET IDENTITY SYSTEMS THAT ARE CLOSELY TIED TO ADVERTISING
POD0000006060_S0000146 DEVELOPERS WHO BUILD ON BLOCKSTACK CAN EVEN GET PAID TO BUILD BETTER APPLICATIONS USING BLOCKSTACK VIA THE APP MINING PROGRAM
POD0000006060_S0000153 SO IF YOU'RE GETTING STARTED
POD0000006060_S0000172 I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CRYPTOJACKING SCRIPT ACTUALLY WORKS SO I GO TO TESLA DOT COM
POD0000006060_S0000190 SO WE CANNOT DEPEND ON SUCH BASIC DEFENSE
POD0000006060_S0000223 THEIR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE BLACKLISTED BY THEIR BIG CUSTOMERS LIKE BANKS AND ALL THOSE
POD0000006060_S0000242 AND THAT'S BASICALLY THE PATH
POD0000006060_S0000280 BUT NOT ONE NOT ONE PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON PREVENTING THAT A CRYPTOJACKING SCRIPT IS DEPLOYED SO THAT'S THE THING ANYONE IS FREE TO DEPLOY A CRYPTOJACKING SCRIPT AT ANY TIME
POD0000006060_S0000312 AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE HOSTED ON CLOUD PROVIDERS I GUESS SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO INTRODUCE WHAT YOU'RE WORKING ON
POD0000006060_S0000325 SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE IS A GREAT PLACE TO LEARN ABOUT MICROSERVICES DOMAIN-DRIVEN DESIGN
POD0000006060_S0000330 I'VE MET GREAT PEOPLE AT EVERY O'REILLY CONFERENCE I'VE GONE TO
POD0000006060_S0000351 BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DETECT IF CRYPTOJACKERS ARE RUNNING ON THESE COMPANIES DOMAINS
POD0000006060_S0000360 NEWER DEVELOPERS THE THING IS THEY MIGHT BE CONSUMING REALLY RANDOM GITHUB REPOSITORIES
POD0000006060_S0000382 I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT THAT
POD0000006060_S0000407 SO THIS GUY STARTED LIKE HERE IN COLOMBIA UNIVERSITY AND THEN IN CHILE MEXICO ETC
POD0000006060_S0000437 WIX HAS YOU COVERED SO YOU CAN SPEND MORE TIME FOCUSING ON YOURSELF AND YOUR CLIENTS
POD0000006060_S0000442 YOU CAN EXPLORE ALL THE RESOURCES ON THE WIX CODE'S SITE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WEB DEVELOPMENT WHEREVER YOU ARE IN YOUR DEVELOPER CAREER
POD0000006068_S0000006 BUT WHEN YOU BUILD A DOMAIN SPECIFIC DATA APPLICATION FOR A KNOWLEDGE WORKERS
POD0000006068_S0000014 AND COUCHBASE SYNC GATEWAY
POD0000006068_S0000021 RYANAIR
POD0000006068_S0000037 BUT IT'S JUST REPORTING
POD0000006068_S0000062 THE PEOPLE THAT TEND TO MAKE IT ARE NOT ALWAYS SOFTWARE PROFESSIONALS SO SOMETIMES THEY'RE INEFFICIENT IN THE ITERATION
POD0000006068_S0000084 YOU MIGHT JUST FOCUS ON DATA OR ALGORITHM OR VISUALIZATION AND SO I THINK FOR SOMEONE THAT'S COMING AT IT FROM A PARTICULAR DIRECTION LIKE IN YOUR EXAMPLE SOMEONE WHO HAS SOME DATA
POD0000006068_S0000102 MAKE IT EASIER TO WORK WITH LINK DATA
POD0000006068_S0000109 AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS SORT OF BECOMES LIKE A FORMULA IN EXCEL THAT CAN BE CONNECTED TOGETHER TO WORK ON THESE DATA STRUCTURES IN A WAY THAT'S INTERACTIVE
POD0000006068_S0000121 I SPEND NINETY PERCENT OF MY TIME CLEANING DATA
POD0000006068_S0000138 WHERE YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THOSE SENTENCES LIKE A SUBJECT
POD0000006068_S0000154 THIS STARTS TO BUILD A GRAPH INSTEAD OF A TABLE IT STARTS TO BUILD A GRAPH MEANING NODES AND EDGES ALL INTERCONNECTED
POD0000006068_S0000174 BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY EASY TO CONNECT R FUNCTIONALITY TO SOME SIDEKIT LEARN FUNCTIONALITY IN PYTHON
POD0000006068_S0000206 APICA SYSTEM HELPS COMPANIES WITH THEIR END-USER EXPERIENCE
POD0000006068_S0000214 GO TO SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH APICA TO FIND THE LATEST WEBINARS ON LOAD TESTING AND LOTS OF OTHER TOPICS
POD0000006068_S0000233 THAT PROVIDES AN ENTRY POINT INTO THE APPLICATION THAT REALLY GENERATES SORT OF A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF REVIEW AND DISCUSSION
POD0000006068_S0000253 AS A WAY TO SHOW HOW DIFFERENT FRAGMENTS ARE CONNECTED
POD0000006068_S0000273 THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE PUT MORE AND MORE IN A POSITION OF BEING ABLE TO CREATIVELY EXPLORE THE SPACES THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN
POD0000006068_S0000286 HOW CAN TECHNOLOGY FACILITATE INNOVATION WE LIVE IN A WORLD TODAY WHERE WE ARE BUILDING TECHNOLOGICAL PLATFORMS FOR FACILITATING ALL KINDS OF THINGS WE FACILITATE FINDING NEW MUSIC THROUGH THINGS LIKE PANDORA
POD0000006068_S0000297 IT IS THIS RECURSIVE DESIRE TO GIVE PEOPLE THE CREATIVE ACCESS BECAUSE
POD0000006068_S0000309 AND THEY DON'T NEED TO KNOW AHEAD OF TIME ALL OF THE PERFECT USES FOR IT
POD0000006068_S0000323 UNLESS YOU GO THROUGH AND CHANGE ALL THE DIV NAMES YOU END UP WITH THEM STEPPING ON EACH OTHER'S TOES
POD0000006068_S0000335 IT'S SMALLER AND SMALLER SPECIALIZED SERVICES THAT DO A CERTAIN THING VERY WELL
POD0000006076_S0000003 THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS HAS SEEN A RISE IN MODERN DATA MANAGEMENT COMPANIES BUILT IN A TIME OF DECREASING STORAGE COSTS
POD0000006076_S0000010 SEAN JOINS THE SHOW TO TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A DATA INFRASTRUCTURE COMPANY AS WELL AS HIS LESSONS BUILDING ASCEND
POD0000006076_S0000015 AND OUR NEW HACKATHON PRODUCT ALLOWS YOU TO ORGANIZE YOUR HACKATHON PARTICIPANTS TO MAKE YOUR HACKATHON AS PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE
POD0000006076_S0000020 AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE
POD0000006076_S0000027 IF YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY FOR A WHILE YOU KNOW THAT THESE SYSTEMS ARE HARD TO BUILD AND THEY TAKE ENGINEERING DETAILS AT BOTH THE HIGH-LEVEL AND AT THE LOW-LEVEL
POD0000006076_S0000034 SO CHECK IT OUT
POD0000006076_S0000054 WE FIND A LOT OF PEOPLE START TO BUILD PRETTY COMPLEX DATA PIPELINES
POD0000006076_S0000066 IF I KEEP RUNNING THE SAME INQUIRY AS MY DATA ITSELF CHANGES
POD0000006076_S0000074 AND WHERE DID ALL THAT DATA GO
POD0000006076_S0000096 WE USE KUBERNETES TO DECLARE AND DEFINE OUR CONTAINER ORCHESTRATION
POD0000006076_S0000107 INSPECT WHAT'S BEEN MAYBE CACHED INSIDE OF S THREE
POD0000006076_S0000117 LIKE UBER OR LYFT
POD0000006076_S0000126 THERE IS REALLY AN INCREMENTAL MIGRATION STRATEGY THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
POD0000006076_S0000141 HEROKU'S FOCUS HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON THE DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE
POD0000006076_S0000146 AND THAT MEANS YOU CAN FOCUS ON BUILDING DATA-DRIVEN APPS NOT DATA INFRASTRUCTURE
POD0000006076_S0000152 AND THANKS TO HEROKU FOR BEING A SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
POD0000006076_S0000162 THAT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE IT SEEMS REALLY REALLY HARD SO HOW DO YOU AVOID BECOMING A COMPANY WHERE YOU GO FROM CUSTOMER TO CUSTOMER AND JUST KIND OF HAVE TO PROVIDE A BESPOKE SYSTEM
POD0000006076_S0000186 WE CAN SIMPLY THEN FIT IT INTO THAT SAME ARCHITECTURE
POD0000006076_S0000203 AND THEY'RE ORCHESTRATING A TON OF THESE JOBS TO THEN MOVE THE DATA INTO USUALLY SNOWFLAKE OR RED SHIFT
POD0000006076_S0000216 THE EQUIVALENT WOULD BE FOR EXAMPLE
POD0000006076_S0000231 DATA LAKES DATA PLATFORMS DATABASES
POD0000006076_S0000245 YOU GET TO DO THINGS LIKE REALLY PROACTIVE PERSISTENCE WHICH FROM THE OTHER WORLDS THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN ENGINEERS IN AND THINK OF IT AS LIKE REALLY SMART CACHING RIGHT
POD0000006076_S0000258 IN A DECLARATIVE MODEL YOU CAN ACTUALLY THEN PUSH THAT BURDEN BACK DOWN TO THE SYSTEM ITSELF THAT CONTROL PLANE
POD0000006076_S0000269 WHEN WE START TO WRITE TRANSFORMS ON DATA
POD0000006076_S0000274 WE CAN ACTUALLY INFER A LOT OF THE OUTPUT SCHEMAS AS WELL
POD0000006076_S0000284 AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE DATASTAX THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTED TO THE CASSANDRA PROJECT SINCE DAY ONE AS A SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY DATASTAX PROVIDES DATASTAX ENTERPRISE A POWERFUL DISTRIBUTION OF CASSANDRA CREATED BY THE TEAM THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED THE MOST TO CASSANDRA
POD0000006076_S0000289 IMPROVE SCALABILITY AND SECURITY
POD0000006076_S0000305 IF YOU GO TALK TO DATA ENGINEERING MANAGERS
POD0000006076_S0000327 BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
POD0000006076_S0000343 PRICING IS REALLY INTERESTING IT'S A GOOD QUESTION
POD0000006076_S0000357 WE'RE ONLY GOING TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE TWO CORES FOR THE SECONDS THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING IT
POD0000006076_S0000380 SIMPLY PUT
POD0000006076_S0000393 WE KNOW ALL THREE CLOUD VENDORS HAVE THEIR IMPERATIVE-BASED ORCHESTRATION TOOLS
POD0000006076_S0000402 WE'LL FIND THE DATA
POD0000006076_S0000417 I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BUILDING DATA PRODUCTS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND IT'S TRULY INTERESTING MARKET RIGHT NOW I THINK
POD0000006076_S0000429 THERE ARE STILL HUGE INEFFI CIENCIES FOR OUR LIVES AS DATA ENGINEERS
POD0000006076_S0000445 OR AN ESTABLISHED COMPANY THAT WANTS ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING HELP
POD0000006076_S0000450 THESE ARE ENGINEERS WHO KNOW ABOUT THE REACT ECOSYSTEM ABOUT THE MOBILE ECOSYSTEM ABOUT GRAPHQL REACT NATIVE
POD0000006084_S0000005 WE'RE LOOKING FOR OUTSIDE VOICES WHO HAVE INTERESTING SUBJECTS AROUND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING THAT THEY WANT TO REPORT ON
POD0000006084_S0000012 SPRING IS A SEASON OF GROWTH AND CHANGE HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING YOU'D BE HAPPIER AT A NEW JOB IF YOU'RE DREAMING ABOUT A NEW JOB AND HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME TO MAKE A MOVE
POD0000006084_S0000019 YOU AND YOUR SKILLS ARE IN HIGH DEMAND
POD0000006084_S0000031 AND SO I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE ON THAT FRONT
POD0000006084_S0000040 IT COULD BE A HEAT MAP FRAME WHERE THE BIGGEST SPENDERS LIVE
POD0000006084_S0000058 DATABASES
POD0000006084_S0000068 FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE TRACKING PURCHASES AT A STORE
POD0000006084_S0000083 THE ACCRUES WILL TAKE LONGER THE ANALYSIS WILL TAKE LONGER
POD0000006084_S0000107 I'VE SEEN THAT STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE USING EXCEL
POD0000006084_S0000116 TOOLS LIKE PERISCOPE DATA INVOLVE USING THE CUSTOMER DATA BECAUSE YOU WANT TO GET ANALYTICS IN YOUR DATA
POD0000006084_S0000134 ORACLE DYN PROVIDES DNS THAT IS AS DYNAMIC AND INTELLIGENT AS YOUR APPLICATIONS
POD0000006084_S0000141 RETHINK DNS
POD0000006084_S0000157 YOU'RE A PRODUCT MANAGER CURRENTLY
POD0000006084_S0000168 DO CUSTOMER RESEARCH
POD0000006084_S0000180 WITH OUR SUPPORT TEAM WITH OUR SALES TEAM
POD0000006084_S0000188 ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF THIS IS SHARING THE DATA BETWEEN THE ORGANIZATION
POD0000006084_S0000198 WE'VE FOUND THAT THERE IS A LOT OF RISK IN THAT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T DEFINE THE DATA MODELS PROPERLY IT'S REALLY EASY TO MAKE A MISTAKE
POD0000006084_S0000211 HOW OFTEN DO THEY USE THEM IN ANY GIVEN DAY HOW MANY DASHBOARDS MIGHT THESE FILTERS EXIST ON
POD0000006084_S0000218 ANOTHER WAY THAT I KNOW OF GATHERING DATA IS GETTING CUSTOMERS IN A FOCUS ROOM AND JUST WATCHING THEM
POD0000006084_S0000228 GOOGLE IS NINETEEN PERCENT FEMALE IN TECHNICAL ROLES
POD0000006084_S0000243 ONCE THERE'S WOMEN IN TECHNICAL ROLES WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE STILL A SMALL NUMBER OF THEM IN LEADERSHIP ROLES THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT COMPANIES
POD0000006084_S0000260 BUT THE DEVICE THAT YOU INTERACT WITH THE MOST IS YOUR SMARTPHONE AND YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW TO PROGRAM IT
POD0000006084_S0000265 CODEPATH HAS FREE EVENING CLASSES FOR DEDICATED EXPERIENCED ENGINEERS AND DESIGNERS
POD0000006084_S0000270 CODEPATH IS ALSO SOMETHING YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT
POD0000006092_S0000010 IF ALICE WANTS TO PAY CASH TO BOB SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO AND MEET HIM AT A PHYSICAL BANK
POD0000006092_S0000017 THESE PEOPLE KEEP THEIR CRYPTOCURRENCIES SPREAD OUT ON THEIR HARDWARE WALLETS
POD0000006092_S0000028 WHAT HAPPENS IF ALL OF THE DATA CENTERS AT AMAZON WEB SERVICES GET SIMULTANEOUSLY WIPED
POD0000006092_S0000041 IN ORDER TO FIX A VERY SPECIFIC SYSTEM WE CREATE A NEW TOOL
POD0000006092_S0000048 BOB LOGS ON TO THE E-COMMERCE WEBSITE FROM A DIFFERENT COMPUTER AT THE SAME TIME THAT ALICE IS LOGGED ON BOB JUST WANTS TO BUY A TUXEDO
POD0000006092_S0000053 BOB WANTS TO DELETE ALL THE ITEMS IN THE SHOPPING CART
POD0000006092_S0000058 WHICH REQUEST SHOULD EXECUTE FIRST
POD0000006092_S0000063 THERE IS NO WAY TO AVOID THAT
POD0000006092_S0000069 IMAGINE ALL THE OTHER WAYS THAT YOU COLLABORATE WITH OTHER USERS
POD0000006092_S0000075 AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION IS CONFLICT-FREE REPLICATED DATA TYPES
POD0000006092_S0000085 ELEGANT ABSTRACTIONS THAT LET INEXPERIENCED PROGRAMMERS BUILD PEER-TO-PEER APPLICATIONS WITHOUT THE FEAR OF CONFLICTS MARTIN KLEPPMANN IS TODAY'S GUEST AND HE IS A DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS RESEARCHER
POD0000006092_S0000093 YOU CAN FIND A LINK TO THAT EPISODE IN THE SHOW NOTES
POD0000006092_S0000100 MAYBE YOUR BUSINESS HAVE BEEN USING ON-PREMISE SERVERS AND YOU WANT TO START MOVING SOME OF YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO A SECURE CLOUD PROVIDER THAT YOU CAN TRUST
POD0000006092_S0000111 OR IF WE HAPPEN TO BE SOMEWHERE WITHOUT OUR LAPTOP WE CAN ACCESS OUR FILE IN THE CLOUD
POD0000006092_S0000133 BUT ACTUALLY THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT SEEMS TO BE VIA A DATA CENTER IN VIRGINIA
POD0000006092_S0000162 I WANT TO WORK OUR WAY SLOWLY TOWARDS THE DISCUSSION OF RESOLVING THAT KIND OF CONFLICT THE CONFLICT IN A DISTRIBUTED DOCUMENT
POD0000006092_S0000175 AND THEN YOU CAME ALONG AND WANTED TO REMOVE A AND INSTEAD ADD B
POD0000006092_S0000185 DATADOG PROVIDES YOUR TEAM WITH THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO QUICKLY TROUBLESHOOT AND OPTIMIZE MODERN APPLICATIONS SEE FOR YOURSELF
POD0000006092_S0000200 YOU RUN INTO THE PROBLEM THAT YOU NOW HAVE TO SEND ALL OF THE UPDATES TO A CENTRAL SERVER
POD0000006092_S0000236 THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF OPERATIONAL TRANSFORMATION RESEARCH HAS JUST BEEN SUCH A TRAIN WRECK
POD0000006092_S0000261 I HAVE A BUNCH OF CHANGES TO DOCUMENT YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF CHANGES TO THE DOCUMENT
POD0000006092_S0000289 SUCH THAT WHEN SEVERAL PEOPLE CHANGE THAT DATA STRUCTURE CONCURRENTLY
POD0000006092_S0000317 REACT NATIVE REACT AND MOBILE
POD0000006092_S0000322 IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO BUILD CROSS-PLATFORM APPLICATIONS IN REACT NATIVE
POD0000006092_S0000341 A CHARACTER YOU CAN REPRESENT IN ONE BYTE
POD0000006092_S0000380 AND WE'LL ATTACH MY NODE ID TO THAT
POD0000006092_S0000416 THEN THE MERGED OUTCOME WOULD BE THAT YOU HAVE THIS ITEM IN A TO-DO LIST WHICH CONSISTS ONLY OF THE BOUILLON FIELD THAT WHERE THE TITLE HAS DISAPPEARED
POD0000006092_S0000442 OR DO YOU JUST WANT TO SAY WELL
POD0000006092_S0000478 WHICH IS SIMPLE
POD0000006092_S0000497 WE'VE REPORTED ON TRANSFERWISE IN PAST EPISODES AND I LOVE THE COMPANY BECAUSE THEY MAKE INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS MORE EFFICIENT LAST YEAR TRANSFERWISE'S VP OF ENGINEERING HARSH SINHA CAME ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY TO DISCUSS HOW TRANSFERWISE WORKS
POD0000006100_S0000005 BUT EVERY COMPANY WORKS DIFFERENTLY AND THERE ARE FEW HARD AND FAST RULES FOR THE WORKFLOWS AROUND MACHINE LEARNING OPERATIONS DETERMINED AI IS A PLATFORM THAT PROVIDES A MEANS FOR COLLABORATING AROUND DATA PREPARATION MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING AND MODEL DEPLOYMENT
POD0000006100_S0000011 IT SUPPORTS NOT ONLY LOCAL STORAGE FOR YOUR ARTIFACTS
POD0000006100_S0000025 AND IN PRACTICE THE BOTTLENECK THAT I HEAR ABOUT MOST OFTEN IS WE'VE GOT A DATA SCIENTIST THAT'S WORKING WITH A NOTEBOOK A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
POD0000006100_S0000036 YOU WOULD THINK THAT THAT WOULD REALLY BE TABLE STAKES
POD0000006100_S0000057 THAT EXAMPLE OF HAVING HETEROGENEOUS HARDWARE
POD0000006100_S0000063 WHAT IS IT GOING TO PERFORM LIKE
POD0000006100_S0000077 AND WE'RE IN A TIME WHERE THERE ARE SO MUCH GOOD TOOLING A LOT OF THESE TOOLING IS DISPARATE
POD0000006100_S0000088 WE MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO EITHER DO YOUR TRAINING ON-PREMISE OR IN THE CLOUD TO WORK WITH WHEREVER YOUR EXISTING TRAINING DATA HAPPENS TO LIVE
POD0000006100_S0000108 AND WHAT WE ENABLE YOU TO DO IS CONTINUE TO USE TOOLS LIKE TENSORFLOW AND PYTORCH TO WRITE ON YOUR MODEL ARCHITECTURE
POD0000006100_S0000120 THAT'S JUST A CONFIGURATION SETTING WHERE YOU SAY HEY
POD0000006100_S0000147 THESE ARE ANNOYING PROBLEMS
POD0000006100_S0000153 THAT MEANS VIDEO REPLAYS
POD0000006100_S0000164 AND WE TAKE CARE OF SCHEDULING AND ORCHESTRATING THAT WORKLOAD
POD0000006100_S0000172 YOU ARE TRAINING MANY DIFFERENT MODELS
POD0000006100_S0000185 IF THAT'S THE BOTTLENECK ON
POD0000006100_S0000210 THAT IS HARDER TO PARALYZE
POD0000006100_S0000218 SOME MODELS THAT WORKS WELL
POD0000006100_S0000249 AND WE REALLY FOUND THAT THE LEVEL OF KUBERNETES PENETRATION FOR GPU AND DEEP LEARNING WORKLOADS THREE YEARS AGO WAS VERY SMALL
POD0000006100_S0000266 I WOULDN'T SAY THERE'S LIKE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO DO THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO
POD0000006100_S0000278 BUT IF WE'RE BEING HONEST I DON'T KNOW OF MANY ENGINEERS WHO REALLY ENJOY BUILDING INTERNAL TOOLS
POD0000006100_S0000284 AND THEY CAN SPEND MORE TIME BUILDING FEATURES THAT CUSTOMERS WILL SEE
POD0000006100_S0000304 YOU CAN KIND OF SET PARAMETERS THERE IN TERMS OF THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF INSTANCES YOU WANT TO PROVISION OR WHAT TYPE OF INSTANCE YOU WANT TO PROVISION
POD0000006100_S0000317 AND THEY WANT TO SEE SOME EVIDENCE THAT DEEP LEARNING CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SOLVE
POD0000006100_S0000340 FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
POD0000006100_S0000351 WHEREAS OTHER PEOPLE THEY'RE SORT OF STILL TRYING TO LOOK AROUND THE CORNER AND PREDICT
POD0000006100_S0000370 COMPANIES LIKE CEREBRAS AND GRAPHCORE
POD0000006100_S0000386 BUT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE
POD0000006100_S0000391 TRIPLEBYTE IMPROVES THE HIRING PROCESS BY SAVING YOU TIME AND FAST-TRACKING YOU TO FINAL INTERVIEWS
POD0000006100_S0000399 TRIPLEBYTE ONLY CARES ABOUT WHETHER SOMEONE CAN CODE
POD0000006108_S0000004 HUMANS CAN READ AND UNDERSTAND NEWS ARTICLES VIDEOS AND WIKIPEDIA PAGES
POD0000006108_S0000009 HOW TO DERIVE STRUCTURE FROM THE UNSTRUCTURED WEB
POD0000006108_S0000023 IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN BECOMING A HOST FOR FINTECH DAILY SEND US AN EMAIL
POD0000006108_S0000030 MANIFOLD MAKES YOUR LIFE EASIER BY PROVIDING A SINGLE WORKFLOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR SERVICES
POD0000006108_S0000037 ONCE YOU HAVE THE SERVICES THAT YOU NEED YOU CAN DELIVER YOUR CONFIGURATION TO ANY ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN DEPLOY ON ANY CLOUD
POD0000006108_S0000045 THANKS AGAIN TO MANIFOLD
POD0000006108_S0000063 THEN YOU COULD PROCESS THAT ARTICLE AND PROVIDE STRUCTURE TO IT
POD0000006108_S0000074 AS AN EXAMPLE
POD0000006108_S0000101 WE WOULD RETURN BACK THE ARTICLE'S TITLE ITS AUTHOR ITS PUBLICATION DAY
POD0000006108_S0000130 ON THE ENTERPRISE SIDE
POD0000006108_S0000153 A LITTLE SECURITY A LITTLE SYSTEM DESIGN
POD0000006108_S0000162 THANKS TO TRIPLEBYTE FOR BEING A SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY WE APPRECIATE IT
POD0000006108_S0000191 THEY PAY YOU A LITTLE BIT AND YOU GET THE INFORMATION FROM THAT EXTRACTION
POD0000006108_S0000216 AND ALSO SKY DAYTON WHO IS THE FOUNDER OF EARTHLINK
POD0000006108_S0000247 BUT IT'S STILL AN AREA THAT WE'RE ACTIVELY RESEARCHING
POD0000006108_S0000282 WE HAVE OTHER FARMS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOOKING AT THE PIXELS OF AN IMAGE AND DETERMINING OKAY
POD0000006108_S0000292 START MONITORING YOUR MICRO SERVICES TODAY WITH A FREE TRIAL
POD0000006108_S0000342 IF YOU LOOK AT THE GOOGLE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH
POD0000006108_S0000382 SO WE SEE
POD0000006108_S0000393 AND THEY MAKE IT EASY TO INSTALL MONITORING AND LOGGING AND OTHER TOOLING ALONGSIDE YOUR KUBERNETES CLUSTER
POD0000006108_S0000400 AND HE WAS SO GOOD AND SO GENEROUS WITH HIS EXPLANATIONS OF VARIOUS DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS CONCEPTS
POD0000006116_S0000009 AND IN THIS EPISODE WE'RE GOING TO DIVE INTO SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THE INTEL NERVANA TEAM IS WORKING
POD0000006116_S0000014 ADD YOUR TEXT IMAGES VIDEOS AND MORE
POD0000006116_S0000021 OR SIMPLY EXPLORE AND SHARE NEW IDEAS
POD0000006116_S0000026 AND WHEN YOU'RE READY TO UPGRADE
POD0000006116_S0000035 WE'VE COVERED RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS AND REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AND TENSORFLOW
POD0000006116_S0000045 DESCRIBE THE PROCESS OF TRAINING THAT NEURAL NETWORK
POD0000006116_S0000069 WHAT DOES THAT TERM GRADIENT MEANS IN STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT WE'RE REFINING THIS GRADIENT EXPLAIN WHAT THE GRADIENT IS
POD0000006116_S0000094 I'M NOT REALLY SURE I THINK YOU COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION ON A REALLY SMALL MODEL IN A SMALL DATASET
POD0000006116_S0000115 LIKE CLOSER TO THE INPUT SIDE
POD0000006116_S0000121 THIS IS KNOWN AS SYNCHRONOUS TRAINING
POD0000006116_S0000136 DYN MAPS ALL INTERNET PATHWAYS EVERY TWENTY FOUR SECONDS VIA MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TRACEROUTES THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF SEVEN LIGHT YEARS OF DISTANCE OR ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION TIMES AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE EARTH
POD0000006116_S0000150 AND SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE ONE OF YOUR LAYERS IS ACTUALLY TOO BIG TO FIT IN MEMORY AND YOU NEED TO SPLIT IT UP ACROSS DEVICES
POD0000006116_S0000167 IN ASYNCHRONOUS CASES
POD0000006116_S0000185 THEN IT LIMITS HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN CLONE THE MODEL OUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIVIDE BY TWO EACH TIME
POD0000006116_S0000207 UPDATE YOUR MODEL AND THEN YOU CAN START THE NEXT STEP
POD0000006116_S0000224 NOW MODEL PARALLELISM DIVIDES UP THE MODELS AND THEN SENDS THE SAME DATASET THE ENTIRE DATASET
POD0000006116_S0000243 ON A SINGLE MACHINE
POD0000006116_S0000253 HOW ARE WE CHOOSING BETWEEN THESE TWO APPROACHES WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS THAT ARE GOOD FOR DATA PARALLELISM AND WHAT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOOD FOR MODEL PARALLELISM
POD0000006116_S0000270 IT'S BEEN DONE VERY MANUALLY IN THE PAST AND EVEN TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S CUMBERSOME AND IF YOU WANT OPTIMIZE IT WELL YOU END UP HAVING TO MAKE CHANGES AT A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT LAYERS IN THE STACK WHICH MAKES YOUR APPROACH FAIRLY FRAGILE
POD0000006116_S0000280 TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE COMPANY CHECK OUT THE INTERVIEWS THAT I'VE CONDUCTED WITH ITS ENGINEERS
POD0000006116_S0000291 IF YOU'RE IN THE SYNCHRONOUS REGIME IF YOU'RE BREAKING YOUR MODEL DOWN INTO EIGHT WORKERS AND THEY'RE ALL SYNCHRONOUS WITH EACH OTHER IF ONE WORKER GOES DOWN
POD0000006116_S0000304 THEY MAY NOT BE PHYSICALLY CLOSE TO A SWITCH
POD0000006116_S0000323 YOU CAN BUILD A NEURAL NETWORK MODEL AS A FUNCTION OF KIND OF CONSTRUCTING THESE GRAPHS
POD0000006116_S0000341 LIKE A SOFTMAX WHICH IS A FUNDAMENTAL ACTIVATION FUNCTION THAT'S USED IN NEURAL NETWORKS
POD0000006116_S0000356 SPECIFICALLY ZEROING IN ON THE KINDS OF NUMBER REPRESENTATIONS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR DEEP LEARNING USING FLOATING POINT THIRTY TWO OR SIXTY FOUR BIT IS IMPORTANT FOR A SCIENTIFIC COMPUTE
POD0000006116_S0000384 I GUESS IF YOU SORT OF EXTRAPOLATE ON THAT TOO
POD0000006116_S0000401 YOU PROBABLY NEED TO START USING A DIFFERENT APPROACH LIKE AN ASYNCHRONOUS SYSTEM WITH A PARAMETER SERVER
POD0000006116_S0000414 SPECIFICALLY SYNCHRONOUS DATA PARALLELISM BUT LONGER-TERM
POD0000006116_S0000428 WE CAN ACTUALLY DESIGN IN A LOT MORE OF THE DISTRIBUTION
POD0000006116_S0000438 IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MOBILE DEVELOPMENT FROM GREAT INSTRUCTORS FOR FREE CHECK OUT CODEPATH
POD0000006116_S0000443 BUT THE FREE CLASSES THAT CODEPATH OFFERED HIM ALLOWED HIM TO DEVELOP A NEW SKILL WHICH WAS MOBILE DEVELOPMENT
POD0000006116_S0000449 AND THANKS TO THE TEAM AT CODEPATH FOR SPONSORING SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY AND FOR PROVIDING A PLATFORM THAT IS USEFUL TO THE SOFTWARE COMMUNITY
POD0000006124_S0000011 THE CUSTOMER IS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH THAT CHATBOX WITH A BOT THAT REPRESENTS THE COMPANY THE CUSTOMER CAN LEARN ABOUT THE PRODUCT SCHEDULE A CALL WITH A SALESPERSON AND GET OTHER USEFUL UTILITIES FROM THE DRIFT SALES BOT
POD0000006124_S0000024 A CLOUD MONITORING PLATFORM BRINGING FULL VISIBILITY TO DYNAMIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND APPLICATIONS
POD0000006124_S0000042 SO THAT THEY CAN TREAT YOU LIKE A PERSON
POD0000006124_S0000080 WE WOULD INSTANTLY HAVE MORE CUSTOMER INSIGHTS WITHIN THAT UNSTRUCTURED MESSY CRAZY DATA ONLY COMING IN THROUGH ONE CHANNEL AT THE TIME WHICH WAS CHAT
POD0000006124_S0000100 THE OTHER IS PREDICTIONS THAT WE'VE MADE BASED ON THAT UNSTRUCTURED DATA
POD0000006124_S0000120 MESOSPHERE'S KUBERNETES AS A SERVICE HEALS ITSELF WHEN IT DETECTS A PROBLEM WITH THE STATE OF THE CLUSTER SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR CLUSTER GOING DOWN
POD0000006124_S0000139 SURE
POD0000006124_S0000180 BUT WE'RE CONSTANTLY GOING FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER WHAT IS YOUR DEPLOYMENT MODEL FOR THESE DIFFERENT SERVICES WE HAVE FOR A LONG TIME NOW
POD0000006124_S0000207 THEY WILL GIVE YOU FIFTY THOUSAND CREDITS FREE
POD0000006124_S0000227 WHEN THIS GDPR COMPLEXITY STARTED APPEARING FOR LOTS OF COMPANIES
POD0000006132_S0000005 FOR MANY USE CASES THIS WORKS JUST FINE
POD0000006132_S0000010 MAYBE YOU WANT TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS MAYBE YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY THAT PERSON AND SEND THEM A TEXT MESSAGE TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY'RE BEING RECORDED ON VIDEO
POD0000006132_S0000015 WHERE IS THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL RUNNING
POD0000006132_S0000020 AND SINCE WE'RE AT THE EDGE WE HAVE INCREASED CONSTRAINTS ON THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE ACCESSIBLE TO US
POD0000006132_S0000029 AND WHEN MULTIPLE LARGE COMPANIES GET INVOLVED IN THAT OPEN SOURCE PROJECT
POD0000006132_S0000037 TAKE THE TRIPLEBYTE QUIZ AND INTERVIEW AND THEN SKIP STRAIGHT TO FINAL INTERVIEW OPPORTUNITIES WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY TOP TECH COMPANIES
POD0000006132_S0000043 TRIPLEBYTE WILL EVEN COVER THE COST OF YOUR FLIGHTS AND HOTELS FOR FINAL INTERVIEWS AT THE HIRING COMPANIES THAT'S PRETTY SWEET
POD0000006132_S0000050 BYTE AS IN EIGHT BITS
POD0000006132_S0000059 THAT BRINGS A SET OF VERY LOW-LATENCY SUPPORT CLOSER TO THE APPLICATIONS AS POSSIBLE
POD0000006132_S0000082 THE CONNECTED CARS NEED VIDEO THE DRONES NEED VIDEO
POD0000006132_S0000124 CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE ROLE OF THE TELECOMS WHEN IT COMES TO THE DYNAMIC OF EDGE COMPUTING
POD0000006132_S0000155 AND I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE FOCUS ON USER EXPERIENCE THE GREAT DOCUMENTATION AND THE SIMPLE USER INTERFACE
POD0000006132_S0000164 THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO EXPERIMENT WITH
POD0000006132_S0000183 AND I WOULD SAY I WOULD NOT CLASSIFY THEM AS EDGE OKAY HERE'S WHY
POD0000006132_S0000215 THE MARKET AND THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO BE HARMONIZED IN ORDER TO GET MORE ADAPTION BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY IF YOU ARE AN END USER A DEVELOPER A VENDOR A SUPPLIER OR A USER
POD0000006132_S0000242 AND THEN ALONG WITH THAT
POD0000006132_S0000266 IT OPENS UP A NEW SET OF APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE LOW-LATENCY
POD0000006132_S0000304 ETC
POD0000006132_S0000335 AND THAT HAS JUST MOVED TO OPEN SOURCE IN JUST THE LAST THREE YEARS
POD0000006140_S0000006 WE USE WIKIPEDIA AS A RUNNING EXAMPLE FOR HOW A QUERY IS PROCESSED AND HOW DOCUMENTS ARE STORED
POD0000006140_S0000015 HIRED MAKES FINDING WORK ENJOYABLE
POD0000006140_S0000021 YOU LISTEN TO A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PODCAST IN YOUR SPARE TIME
POD0000006140_S0000030 BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE SEARCHED THROUGH WHAT ARE SOME APPLICATIONS THAT SEARCH IS USEFUL FOR
POD0000006140_S0000052 YOU'VE GOT THE ENTIRETY OF WIKIPEDIA IT'S ALL OF THESE ARTICLES ABOUT BIOLOGY AND PHYSICS AND HISTORY
POD0000006140_S0000068 EVEN THOUGH THAT'S BIT HARD ON THAT SPECIFIC WORD
POD0000006140_S0000088 I GUESS ELASTIC IS VERY FITTING
POD0000006140_S0000100 THE DATA WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED OVER YOUR MULTIPLE SERVERS AUTOMATICALLY
POD0000006140_S0000118 BECAUSE
POD0000006140_S0000129 YOU CAN TAKE MORE NUMBERS OF SERVICE THAT FAIL
POD0000006140_S0000148 BUT IF YOU NEVER HAVE THAT PROBLEM TO SCALE THAT MUCH YOU'RE JUST WASTING LOTS OF RESOURCES ON THE NUMBER OF SHARDS
POD0000006140_S0000157 FROM THE VISUALLY APPEALING DASHBOARD YOU CAN SEE OUTSTANDING REVENUE SPENDING
POD0000006140_S0000163 YOUR CLIENTS CAN PAY BY CREDIT CARD STRAIGHT FROM THEIR INVOICE
POD0000006140_S0000179 WHICH ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD BE TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE SEARCH USE CASE
POD0000006140_S0000189 YOU WILL GIVE EVERY BLOG POST A MAPPING THAT SETS UP IT GIVES THE SEARCH INDEX SOME INFORMATION ABOUT HOW YOU WANT RESULTS TO BE RETURNED
POD0000006140_S0000201 WHICH IS OFTEN WORKING REASONABLY WELL FOR THE PROTOTYPING PHASE BUT FOR PRODUCTION YOU SHOULD NOT REALLY RELY ON THAT
POD0000006140_S0000211 THIS MUST HAVE A SPECIFIC FEED
POD0000006140_S0000222 BUT THAT WOULD NEVER MATCH ON ANYTHING THAT IS BLUE
POD0000006140_S0000232 AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE ELASTICITY COMPONENT
POD0000006140_S0000244 THIS IS THIS SPECIFIC INDEX THE INDEX HAS THESE SHARDS AND REPLICAS
POD0000006140_S0000251 ALL THE SHARDS WOULD ONLY RETURN KIND OF THEIR MATCHES IF YOU SEARCH FOR THE TEN BEST HITS EACH OF THESE SHARDS WOULD RETURN ITS OWN TEN BEST MATCHES BUT ONLY THE I D AND THE SO-CALLED SCORE WHICH IS BASICALLY A QUALITY ATTRIBUTE
POD0000006140_S0000267 QUITE FRESHLY IN THE LATEST FIVE RELEASE WE HAVE SO-CALLED INGEST NODES
POD0000006140_S0000281 THEY'RE GOOD FOR COORDINATING YOUR QUERIES AND THEN COMBINING RESULTS TOGETHER TO THE FINAL SET YOU WANT TO RETURN TO YOUR APPLICATION
POD0000006140_S0000302 YOU COULD SET IT TO ZERO OR MORE THAN ONE
POD0000006140_S0000310 LUCENE WOULD CREATE A NEW SEGMENT FOR EACH OF THESE ONE SECOND INTERVALS YOU HAVE
POD0000006140_S0000322 THAT'S WHY WE USE ENCAPSULA TO STOP ATTACKERS AND IMPROVE PERFORMANCE
POD0000006140_S0000331 OR A WORDPRESS SITE LIKE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
POD0000006140_S0000343 THOSE SHARDS WOULD THEN BE REPLICATED TO ANOTHER NODE TO AGAIN GET TO YOUR REPLICA FACTOR YOU HAVE CONFIGURED
POD0000006140_S0000356 THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO THE CANONICAL PARTIAL FAILURE
POD0000006140_S0000371 YOUR CLUSTER WOULD BE IN THE RED STATE
POD0000006140_S0000388 THAT IS FINE FOR YOU
POD0000006140_S0000422 AND I THINK THERE ARE NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THIS ONE I CAN THINK OF IS THAT THE LOG DATA THERE'S SO MUCH LOG DATA
POD0000006140_S0000447 SINCE IT'S OPEN-SOURCE IT'S VERY EASY AND CHEAP TO GET STARTED
POD0000006140_S0000470 WHICH SHOULD HELP WITH SPEEDING UP THE REPLICATIONS IN CASE OF FAILURES
POD0000006140_S0000491 RIGHT NOW IT'S PRETTY MUCH BLOCKS OF LEGOS SO YOU HAVE ALL THESE ELEMENTS BUT THERE'S SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED TO PUT THEM TOGETHER
POD0000006140_S0000508 OKAY
POD0000006148_S0000005 BUT THE POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF ENVOY INCLUDE FRONTEND CLIENT APPLICATIONS AS WELL
POD0000006148_S0000011 GRPC AND QUICK
POD0000006148_S0000020 I WILL BE COMMENTING ON EACH EPISODE GOING FORWARD FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE
POD0000006148_S0000025 FINDCOLLABS IS THE COMPANY I'M BUILDING
POD0000006148_S0000030 THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD PODCASTS TO LISTEN TO THESE DAYS AND IT CAN BE HARD TO MAKE TIME TO SIT DOWN AND READ A FULL-LENGTH BOOK
POD0000006148_S0000035 I LIKE BLINKIST BECAUSE I LIKE AUDIO
POD0000006148_S0000045 GIVE A REMINDER OF THE NETWORKING PROBLEMS THAT ENVOY ADDRESSES
POD0000006148_S0000062 HOW DO THE NETWORKING CHALLENGES OF MOBILE DIFFER FROM THE NETWORKING CHALLENGES THAT ARE EXPERIENCED ON THE SERVER-SIDE
POD0000006148_S0000082 SO
POD0000006148_S0000097 GOOGLE HAS A LIBRARY CALLED PRONET WHICH THEY HAVE SHIPPED FOR QUITE SOME TIME IT'S A SECTION OF THE CODE THAT SHIFTS WITH THE CHROME BROWSER
POD0000006148_S0000109 OUR INITIAL TARGET FOR ENVOY MOBILE IS TO ACTUALLY BUNDLE THE CODE AS A LIBRARY COMPONENT AND THEN ACTUALLY SHIP THAT OUT
POD0000006148_S0000127 SO IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE WILL CONSUME THIS IN THE FUTURE
POD0000006148_S0000142 AND THEY'LL SEND YOU A FREE T-SHIRT
POD0000006148_S0000161 SO
POD0000006148_S0000184 SO
POD0000006148_S0000197 BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE WE ARE TODAY
POD0000006148_S0000224 RIGHT
POD0000006148_S0000241 ALL OF THESE APPLICATIONS CAN GET A COMMON SET OF FUNCTIONALITY
POD0000006148_S0000253 BUT IF I GET TO A SPOTTY CELLULAR CONNECTION
POD0000006148_S0000285 INSTABUG ALLOWS YOUR USERS TO GIVE FEEDBACK INSIDE THE APP BY SHAKING THEIR PHONE
POD0000006148_S0000290 OR IF YOU HAVE A LIVE APP WHERE YOU'RE IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH YOUR USERS
POD0000006148_S0000298 AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH YOU
POD0000006148_S0000308 DID ENVOY MOBILE CHANGE YOUR VISION FOR WHAT THE IDEAL SERVICE MESH WOULD LOOK LIKE
POD0000006148_S0000331 WHENEVER I TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
POD0000006148_S0000343 AS YOU'VE SAID
POD0000006148_S0000377 SO
POD0000006148_S0000404 IF YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT STARTING A PODCAST
POD0000006148_S0000409 WE WILL HELP YOU THROUGH THE HURDLES OF STARTING A PODCAST ON PODSHEETS
POD0000006148_S0000415 IF YOU'VE WRITTEN A BLOG POST YOU CAN START A PODCAST
POD0000006148_S0000420 AND I HOPE YOU START A PODCAST BECAUSE I AM STILL RUNNING OUT OF CONTENT TO LISTEN TO
POD0000006156_S0000008 THE IPHONE
POD0000006156_S0000016 WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT MORE TECHNICAL AREAS OF THE ETHEREUM ECOSYSTEM SUCH AS THE ETHEREUM NAME SERVICE
POD0000006156_S0000025 A FIFTEEN DOLLARS FLEXIBLE DROPLET THAT CAN MIX AND MATCH DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS OF CPU AND RAM TO GET THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES FOR YOUR APPLICATION
POD0000006156_S0000044 SOME OF YOUR LISTENERS ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY
POD0000006156_S0000066 IS THAT TOO MUCH OF A HURDLE
POD0000006156_S0000098 LAST WEEK WE HAD AN INVESTOR
POD0000006156_S0000131 YOU SEND THEM A HEXADECIMAL STRING
POD0000006156_S0000157 OH MY GOD WHAT IS THIS WALLET ADDRESS THING I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE A VIRUS
POD0000006156_S0000175 IT'S THE MOST COMPACT DATA STRUCTURE
POD0000006156_S0000198 THESE ARE ISSUES THAT YOU WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ALONE
POD0000006156_S0000230 HOW WOULD YOU RUN A BUSINESS
POD0000006156_S0000263 DNS
POD0000006156_S0000312 I LOVE IT
POD0000006156_S0000327 YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE GOING AROUND QUERYING SMART CONTRACTS OVER A FIVE-DAY PERIOD
POD0000006156_S0000347 TRIPLEBYTE WILL EVEN COVER THE COST OF YOUR FLIGHTS AND HOTELS FOR FINAL INTERVIEWS AT THE HIRING COMPANIES THAT'S PRETTY SWEET TRIPLEBYTE HELPS ENGINEERS IDENTIFY HIGH-GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES
POD0000006156_S0000371 HOW IT WORKS RIGHT NOW IS THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED META MASK AND THERE'S A SIMILAR THING FOR LIGHTNING
POD0000006156_S0000410 I'M NOT UP TO DATE ON IT YEAH
POD0000006156_S0000452 THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A BIG BULL CASE FOR CITIES LIKE AUSTIN
POD0000006156_S0000473 LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THERE'S THE HUGE FORCING FUNCTION FOR MAKING THINGS EASY
POD0000006156_S0000495 YEAH IF YOU CAN PUT YOUR CONDO IN A TOKEN
POD0000006156_S0000505 THEN YOU GET TWENTY PERCENT OF THE RENT EVERY MONTH
POD0000006164_S0000003 ANTONIO GARCIA MARTINEZ IS THE AUTHOR OF CHAOS MONKEYS
POD0000006164_S0000008 THERE WERE MANY DRAMATIC EVENTS THAT ANTONIO TELLS IN GREAT DETAIL
POD0000006164_S0000014 IT'S A PLACE TO FIND COLLABORATORS FOR YOUR SOFTWARE PROJECTS
POD0000006164_S0000020 YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF PAGERDUTY
POD0000006164_S0000027 VISIT PAGERDUTY DOT COM
POD0000006164_S0000084 I PROBABLY SPOKE TO ONE OR TWO PEOPLE
POD0000006164_S0000117 WHICH WOULD'VE BEEN TERRIBLE
POD0000006164_S0000128 OR AT LEAST HOW THOSE THINGS ORIGINATED BECAUSE I JUST WASN'T THERE
POD0000006164_S0000141 ATOMIST IS A PLATFORM FOR BETTER
POD0000006164_S0000150 GO TO SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH ATOMIST TO LEARN ABOUT ATOMIST AND HOW TO AVOID APPLICATION DRIFT
POD0000006164_S0000163 AND I KNOW I'M GOING TO SOUND LIKE A FAN BOY SAYING THIS
POD0000006164_S0000180 IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET A LOT OF BOT TRAFFIC OR FAR LESS THAN LIKE THE WIDER WORLD OF THE INTERNET AND MOBILE APPS
POD0000006164_S0000254 I GOT BACK ON THE ONE ON ONE AND SHOT SOUTH AND GOT OFF IN SHORELINE AND WENT TO GOOGLE JUST LIKE OUT OF CURIOSITY
POD0000006164_S0000267 YOU TO UNDERSTAND
POD0000006164_S0000282 WHETHER THAT'S A VEHICLE FOR PERSONAL SELF-ACTUALIZATION NARCISSISM LIKE INSTAGRAM WHETHER IN THE FUTURE IT'S FINDING THE TIME FOR VIRTUAL REALITY AND ITS OCULUS WHATEVER IT IS
POD0000006164_S0000316 OR YOU SAY OH NO NO NO NO
POD0000006164_S0000372 OH
POD0000006164_S0000424 JUST LOOK UP LITTLE RED BOOK FACEBOOK AND YOU'LL FIND IT
POD0000006164_S0000453 LIKE ADS DATA AND PRIVACY THINGS THAT I'VE ACTUALLY WORKED AND UNDERSTAND
POD0000006164_S0000489 THEIR BIG GROWTH AREAS ARE NOT KINDLE KINDLE SALES ARE PRETTY FLAT I MEAN
POD0000006164_S0000508 BECAUSE FACEBOOK USED TO BE REALLY TIGHTLIPPED AND LEAKS DIDN'T HAPPEN
POD0000006164_S0000533 I MEAN HUMANS BOND OVER A COMMON ENEMY AND SHARED SUFFERING
POD0000006164_S0000549 I THINK INSTAGRAM IS FOR DIRECT TO CONSUMER BRANDS INFLUENCERS
POD0000006164_S0000565 GIVE YOUR USERS INTUITIVE ACCESS TO DATA IN THE IDEAL PLACE FOR THEM TO TAKE ACTION WITHIN YOUR APPLICATION
POD0000006164_S0000570 BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST YOUR COMPANY THAT WANTS ANALYTICS
POD0000006172_S0000006 THE DATA IN OPENSTREETMAP IS CROWDSOURCED BY USERS WHO SUBMIT UPDATES TO THE OPENSTREETMAP DATABASE
POD0000006172_S0000012 SAURAV MOHAPATRA AND JACOB WASSERMAN WORK AT FACEBOOK ON ITS MAPPING INFRASTRUCTURE
POD0000006172_S0000025 THE COMPANY GRAVITATIONAL
POD0000006172_S0000042 THEY COULD SAY THINGS LIKE GO UNDER THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND THEN TURN RIGHT AT THE STOP SIGN
POD0000006172_S0000066 WE CAN DO THAT AT SCALE WE ARE VERY GOOD AT GRAPH DATABASES
POD0000006172_S0000082 HOW ACCURATE DOES THE MAPPING DATA WITHIN FACEBOOK NEED TO BE
POD0000006172_S0000104 I THINK IN TANDEM WITH SOME OTHER APPROACHES LIKE SATELLITE DATA
POD0000006172_S0000124 THEY ARE JUST ON TOP OF IT AND MAPPING IT OR ANY ROAD CHANGE
POD0000006172_S0000140 IF YOU WANT TO DEVELOP SKILLS TO BUILD MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
POD0000006172_S0000147 GO TO SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH SPRINGBOARD
POD0000006172_S0000159 THE FIRST ONE IS A POINT
POD0000006172_S0000189 BECAUSE THIS IS NOT TRANSACTIONAL LIKE WE'RE NOT CHANGING IT WE ARE JUST CONSUMING IT
POD0000006172_S0000207 MALLS SCHOOLS
POD0000006172_S0000229 WHICH CONSISTS OF INDIVIDUAL CHANGES
POD0000006172_S0000249 WE CAN HOLD THOSE PARTS BACK AND FIND ALL THE OTHER CHANGES THAT ARE INTERCONNECTED OR INTERLOCKED AS SAURAV WAS SAYING
POD0000006172_S0000267 IN FACT
POD0000006172_S0000287 IT'S ABOUT MAKING THE BEST CHANGE YOU CAN
POD0000006172_S0000302 OR AN ESTABLISHED COMPANY THAT WANTS ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING HELP
POD0000006172_S0000307 THESE ARE ENGINEERS WHO KNOW ABOUT THE REACT ECOSYSTEM ABOUT THE MOBILE ECOSYSTEM ABOUT GRAPHQL REACT NATIVE
POD0000006172_S0000315 THERE IS BOTH AUTOMATED REVIEW AND HUMAN REVIEW IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING WHICH OF THESE LOCATION CHANGES YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY APPLY TO YOUR LOCAL COPY
POD0000006172_S0000360 BUT WHAT WERE THE LEARNINGS THAT WENT INTO CREATING THE RULE ENGINE FOR THIS AUTOMATED REVIEW PROCESS
POD0000006172_S0000381 GENERATE THESE CATEGORIES AND THEN ULTIMATELY LIKE BUILD SOME AUTOMATED SYSTEM AROUND THEM
POD0000006172_S0000405 BUT IF THAT DOUBT IS BLOW A THRESHOLD IT'S PROBABLY GOOD TO GO UNLESS IT HITS SOME OTHER LIKE THREAT MARKERS
POD0000006172_S0000437 WITHOUT STANDARDIZED APPLICATIONS OR SECURITY POLICIES
POD0000006172_S0000443 UNDERSTAND YOUR IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT PAYLOADS TO LOOK FOR CREDENTIAL HARVESTING AND BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS AND AUTOMATE THE SECURITY SETTINGS OF YOUR CLOUD PROVIDER INTEGRATIONS
POD0000006180_S0000005 ENGINEERS WITHIN THE COMPANY MUST MOVE FAST
POD0000006180_S0000010 AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CAN SOMETIMES SUFFER
POD0000006180_S0000015 THEY JOIN THE SHOW TO REFLECT ON THEIR TIME AT FACEBOOK AND THE DOWNSIDES OF MOVING FAST AS WELL AS THE UPSIDES
POD0000006180_S0000020 FIND COLLABS IS NOT ONLY FOR OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
POD0000006180_S0000025 AND IF YOU ARE IN SOFTWARE AND YOU HAVE THE SKILLSET NEEDED TO GET A JOB IN TECHNOLOGY
POD0000006180_S0000031 NO MORE OF THOSE RECRUITERS SENDING YOU BLIND MESSAGES THAT SAY THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A JAVA ROCKSTAR WITH THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WHO'S WILLING TO RELOCATE TO ANTARCTICA
POD0000006180_S0000043 THE FIRST ONE THAT COMES TO MIND IS THAT WHEN AN ENGINEER IS DROPPED INTO AN ENVIRONMENT THAT MOVES THAT QUICKLY IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY OVERWHELMING IN TERMS OF LIKE BEING ABLE TO ONBOARD THAT QUICKLY
POD0000006180_S0000067 THE CULTURE AT GOOGLE OTHER COMPANIES
POD0000006180_S0000076 WHERE GOOGLE HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF CREATING AN INNOVATION MACHINE
POD0000006180_S0000093 DASHBOARDS AND DATA VISUALIZATIONS THAT DEVELOPERS LOVE
POD0000006180_S0000098 JASPERSOFT IS GREAT FOR ADMIN DASHBOARDS OR FOR HELPING YOUR CUSTOMERS MAKE DATA-DRIVEN DECISIONS WITHIN YOUR PRODUCT
POD0000006180_S0000109 THERE WAS MORE BOTTOMS UP AND THEN NOW IT'S MORE OF A TOP-DOWN ORGANIZATION
POD0000006180_S0000117 IS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THAT OVERALL COMPANY STRATEGY
POD0000006180_S0000128 AND THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH IT
POD0000006180_S0000147 I THINK EVERYTHING IS LIKE TECHNICALLY PRETTY EXCELLENT
POD0000006180_S0000161 THERE IS A GENERAL FEELING
POD0000006180_S0000195 LIKE AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POWER GRAB IN THE INDUSTRY AND SO ON AND SO FORTH
POD0000006180_S0000211 MY WORK WAS VERY PRESCRIBED TO ME
POD0000006180_S0000231 SHOULD I SAY THAT'S ALIGNED WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMPANY
POD0000006180_S0000244 AND IT PROBABLY HAD ALL THE STANDARD STUFF THAT EVERY OTHER COMPANY HAS BUT
POD0000006180_S0000263 WHY THIS IS SO RARE TO SEE IN THE INDUSTRY RELATIVE TO THE EPIDEMIC OF THE MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE
POD0000006180_S0000273 WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SAME
POD0000006180_S0000281 WE OVERLAPPED
POD0000006180_S0000297 AND I THINK THAT THE TOOLS THAT YOU HAVE FOR MONOLITHS ARE BAKED INTO THE FRAMEWORKS LIKE RUBY ON RAILS
POD0000006180_S0000310 EASIER AND END UP PAYING SUBSTANTIALLY LESS
POD0000006180_S0000330 AT LEAST IN THAT ERA
POD0000006180_S0000373 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INVEST A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TOOLING
POD0000006180_S0000390 AT THE SAME TIME
POD0000006180_S0000403 THE MORE THAT I REALIZE THAT LIKE TEAMS AND PEOPLE LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF ANALOGIES TO LIKE DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
POD0000006180_S0000424 THE LOUDER AND MORE ASSORT ASSERTIVE VOICES IN THE ROOM TEND TO BE THE ONES TELLING YOU ALL THE RISKS AND NOT ALL THE REWARDS
POD0000006180_S0000444 YEAH ONE OTHER THING I WOULD JUST ADD IS A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT FACEBOOK DID ARE PACKAGE DEALS I WANT TO SAY
POD0000006188_S0000009 ASK SOLEM IS AN ENGINEER WITH ROBINHOOD AND HE'S THE AUTHOR OF FAUST WHICH IS A STREAM PROCESSING LIBRARY THAT PORTS THE IDEAS OF KAFKA STREAMS TO PYTHON
POD0000006188_S0000014 ASK JOINS THE SHOW TO PROVIDE HIS PERSPECTIVE ON LARGE SCALE DISTRIBUTED STREAM PROCESSING
POD0000006188_S0000021 AFTER ALL POSTGRES IS BATTLE TESTED TRUSTWORTHY DATABASE SOFTWARE
POD0000006188_S0000027 AVAILABLE AS OPEN SOURCE AS A DATABASE AS A SERVICE AND AS ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE
POD0000006188_S0000036 I'D LIKE TO START WITH A DISCUSSION OF STREAM PROCESSING AND BATCH PROCESSING
POD0000006188_S0000044 YOU COULD CONSIDER THAT STREAM IF YOU CONSTANTLY PROCESS IT
POD0000006188_S0000067 IF YOU WANTED TO PROCESS LARGER AND LARGER SETS OF BATCH TRANSACTIONS WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST INCREASE THE SIZE OF YOUR HADOOP CLUSTER AND HAVE THAT SCALE UP MAGICALLY I GUESS THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT HADOOP IS NOT REALLY SUITABLE FOR REAL-TIME STREAMING JOBS THEY HAVE SOME EXTENSIONS FOR IT
POD0000006188_S0000079 AND WE'VE DONE SHOWS ABOUT SPARK AND STORM AND THEN KAFKA STREAM WHICH IS LIKE A SYSTEM A STREAMING SYSTEM THAT'S CLOSELY COUPLED WITH KAFKA
POD0000006188_S0000099 AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO
POD0000006188_S0000118 EVERY MICRO-SERVICE HAS ITS OWN INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
POD0000006188_S0000136 THEY CAN HELP YOU RUN YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE MORE EFFICIENTLY BY HELPING YOU USE COMMITMENTS SPOT INSTANCES RIGHTSIZING AND UNIQUE PURCHASING TECHNIQUES
POD0000006188_S0000149 YEAH
POD0000006188_S0000180 YES I MEAN
POD0000006188_S0000195 IT HAS A NAME I DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME
POD0000006188_S0000210 THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK UP IS THIS USER BANNED
POD0000006188_S0000247 YEAH
POD0000006188_S0000261 ACCENTURE IS COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING TALENT
POD0000006188_S0000279 RIGHT
POD0000006188_S0000307 I DO QUOTATIONS MARKS HERE I'VE HEARD THAT WAS REALLY HARD TO BUILD
POD0000006188_S0000344 BUT IF IT WAS MILLIONS OF RECORDS THEN IT COULD TAKE HOURS TO RECOVER
POD0000006188_S0000388 ONCE YOU HAVE BEEN VETTED AND ACCEPTED TO VETTERY
POD0000006188_S0000394 VETTERY IS COMPLETELY FREE FOR JOBSEEKERS
POD0000006196_S0000005 THERE'S MANY OTHERS
POD0000006196_S0000014 MAXIMILIAN MICHELS HAS WORKED ON THE APACHE FLINK AND APACHE BEAM STREAM PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND CURRENTLY WORKS ON DATA INFRASTRUCTURE AT LYFT
POD0000006196_S0000023 EVERY BUSINESS NEEDS INTERNAL TOOLS
POD0000006196_S0000030 AND THEY CAN SPEND MORE TIME BUILDING FEATURES THAT CUSTOMERS WILL SEE
POD0000006196_S0000044 NOT LIKE COMPLETELY NEW TECHNIQUE TO PROCESS DATA
POD0000006196_S0000084 CAN YOU GIVE A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION FOR WHAT FLINK KEEPS IN-MEMORY AND WHAT FLINK SNAPSHOTS TO DISK WHEN IT'S DOING ITS PROCESSING
POD0000006196_S0000109 BUT THAT WOULD CAUSE A LOT OF BACKLOG AND LATENCY
POD0000006196_S0000127 SEEN BY INDEED PROVIDES A PATH TO NEW CAREER OPPORTUNITIES WHILE REDUCING THE PAIN OF THE TRADITIONAL JOB SEARCH PROCESS
POD0000006196_S0000134 SEEN BY INDEED IS A TECH-FOCUSED MATCHING PLATFORM
POD0000006196_S0000142 WHAT YOU DESCRIBE IS ACTUALLY LIKE THE PRIME USE CASE OF FLINK
POD0000006196_S0000156 GROUP BY
POD0000006196_S0000168 THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION
POD0000006196_S0000178 HOWEVER AND I THINK EVEN THE KAFKA FOLKS HAVE POINTED THAT OUT
POD0000006196_S0000188 AND THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A SYSTEM THAT CAN DO STREAM PROCESSING ON TOP OF A VARIETY OF STREAM PROCESSING ENGINES
POD0000006196_S0000206 LATER ON
POD0000006196_S0000219 CAN YOU GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE CONCEPTS OF THE DATAFL OW PAPER AND HOW THEY IMPACTED BEAM
POD0000006196_S0000249 ANOTHER CONCEPT THAT IS IN THAT PAPER WHICH I SHOULD MENTION IS WINDOWING
POD0000006196_S0000275 IT MIGHT BE HELD BACK FOR THE DOWNSTREAM OPERATOR
POD0000006196_S0000282 OF EVENT TIME DATA AND THEN I CAN KICK-OFF THE COMPUTATION FOR THAT WINDOW
POD0000006196_S0000295 YEAH I UNDERSTAND
POD0000006196_S0000302 AS YOUR BUSINESS GROWS YOU NEED TO START DOING INVOICING
POD0000006196_S0000310 YOU HAVE TOO MANY SYSTEMS TO MANAGE
POD0000006196_S0000319 I THINK
POD0000006196_S0000331 THAT'S JUST AN EASIER WAY THEN
POD0000006196_S0000356 WHICH REQUIRE
POD0000006196_S0000377 WHICH STILL EXIST TODAY IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT FOR SURE
POD0000006196_S0000393 MAX THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW IT'S BEEN GREAT TALKING TO YOU THANK YOU JEFF FOR HAVING ME
POD0000006196_S0000398 BUT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE
POD0000006196_S0000403 TRIPLEBYTE IMPROVES THE HIRING PROCESS BY SAVING YOU TIME AND FAST-TRACKING YOU TO FINAL INTERVIEWS
POD0000006196_S0000410 TRIPLEBYTE DOES NOT LOOK AT CANDIDATE'S BACKGROUNDS LIKE RESUMES AND WHERE THEY'VE WORKED AND WHERE THEY WENT TO SCHOOL
POD0000006204_S0000003 BUT FREECODECAMP IS THE BEST PLACE TO START
POD0000006204_S0000008 IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT A NEW PROGRAMMER LEARNS FROM AN UNBIASED SOURCE OF INFORMATION
POD0000006204_S0000014 WHY WOULD SOMEBODY BUILD A NONPROFIT WHEN THEY COULD SPEND THEIR TIME BUILDING A HIGHLY-PROFITABLE SOFTWARE COMPANY
POD0000006204_S0000021 SO WHY WOULD SOMEBODY DO THAT
POD0000006204_S0000029 DATAS TAX PROVIDES DATAS TAX ENTERPRISE A POWERFUL DISTR IBUTION OF CASSANDRA CREATED BY THE TEAM THAT HAS CONTR IBUTED THE MOST TO CASSANDRA
POD0000006204_S0000046 SO FREECODECAMP FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE UNAWARE IS GIGANTIC IT HELPS TONS OF PEOPLE
POD0000006204_S0000056 THERE ARE CHARITIES THAT ARE WILDLY PROFITABLE THERE ARE VERY FEW OF THEM
POD0000006204_S0000062 IT'S ALMOST A NONPROFIT THAT SWALLOWED A MUCH MUCH LARGER FOR-PROFIT ENTERPRISE
POD0000006204_S0000068 WHERE DID YOU DERIVE THAT CONFIDENCE FROM
POD0000006204_S0000078 WE COULD'VE KEPT IT SMALL
POD0000006204_S0000088 BUT WERE ABLE TO USE FREECODECAMP AND LEARN ENOUGH THAT THEY COULD GO OUT AND GET A JOB AS A DEVELOPER
POD0000006204_S0000099 AND TESTING
POD0000006204_S0000113 I WOULD DESCRIBE BOB ROSS AS A TEACHER
POD0000006204_S0000133 SO MY DAD WAS A STRICT DISCIPL INARIAN
POD0000006204_S0000158 FOR ME
POD0000006204_S0000176 CONTRAST THE INVIGORATION OF YOUR ACTIVE LEARNING PROCESS TO THE STAGNATION OF THE TRADITIONAL EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT YOU GREW SO DISILLUSIONED WITH
POD0000006204_S0000190 LIKE HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE GROWING BUREAUCRACY
POD0000006204_S0000209 I HAD A BUNCH OF KOREAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE STUDENTS WHO SHARED ROOM WITH ME
POD0000006204_S0000220 SHE WAS ABLE TO BECOME A U S CITIZEN
POD0000006204_S0000244 I WAS IN A SITUATION WHERE I NOTICED THAT MY TEACHERS WERE SPENDING A WHOLE LOT OF TIME
POD0000006204_S0000260 ABOUT THE DYNAM ICS OF CREATING SOFTWARE AND MAINTAINING SOFTWARE DURING DEPLOYMENTS
POD0000006204_S0000272 MY SENSE IS THAT IT IS BIG AND GROWS EVERY YEAR
POD0000006204_S0000281 AND THAT INFORMED FREECODECAMP BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS LIKE WHY DO PEOPLE MEET IN-PERSON FOR SCHOOL
POD0000006204_S0000292 ONLINE SELF-PACED LEARN ING AND UNDERSTANDING THE MOTIVATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT GO ALONG WITH IT
POD0000006204_S0000307 OR HAD ANY MOMENTS OF
POD0000006204_S0000320 THE ENTIRE TIME YOU WERE IN A CODE EDITOR CODING AND YOU HAD THIS TEST SUITE
POD0000006204_S0000333 AND WITHIN A FEW
POD0000006204_S0000342 I HAVE USED HERROKU PERSONALLY MORE THAN ANY OTHER CLOUD PROVIDER
POD0000006204_S0000350 OUR VERY OWN SITE SOFTWAREDAILY DOT COM RUNS ON HEROKU
POD0000006204_S0000361 BUT I REMEMBER TALKING TO YOU AT THIS BERKELEY BURRITO PLACE
POD0000006204_S0000381 SO EARLY ON
POD0000006204_S0000398 SO I WOULD SAY THAT I'M NOT THE BEST DEVELOPER IN THE WOR LD I'M PROBABLY NOT THE BEST ON THE SPOT LIKE GO UP AND GIVE A LECTURE STYLE TEACHER IN THE WOR LD
POD0000006204_S0000405 COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE HAD AN OUTAGE
POD0000006204_S0000426 THEY DONATE FIVE BOOKS A MONTH OR TEN BUCKS A MONTH OR THIRTY FIVE BUCKS A MONTH
POD0000006204_S0000444 SHAWN WANG
POD0000006204_S0000470 HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE WHAT FREECODECAMP IS
POD0000006204_S0000494 ALGOLIA GIVES US SEARCH AND THAT MEANS WE DON'T HAVE TO RUN AN ELASTICSEARCH SERVER
POD0000006204_S0000517 BECAUSE FREECODECAMP IS SO NEW
POD0000006204_S0000529 YOU KNOW WHAT QUINCY
POD0000006204_S0000536 HOW HAS THE MARKET FOR CODING EDUCATION PRODUCTS CHANGED SINCE YOU STARTED FREECODECAMP
POD0000006204_S0000551 I'M NOT SURE I MEAN THERE ARE DEFINITELY MORE DEVELOPERS
POD0000006204_S0000568 YOU CAN DO THIS
POD0000006204_S0000576 THE TIME WHEN I FIRST CROSSED PATHS WITH YOU ON THE INTERNET WAS WHEN I WAS ON QUORA A LOT
POD0000006204_S0000594 WHAT YOU DESCRIBED WITH THE UNIVERS ITY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU WENT THROUGH
POD0000006204_S0000614 WHO'S IN THE FIELD AND SAYING WELL WE CAN DO THAT TOO
POD0000006204_S0000621 EDUCATION
POD0000006204_S0000628 AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SUFFER FROM THOSE MIS TAKES WHO WOULD BE SOMEWHAT INSULATED FROM THEM IF THEY WERE IN ONE OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS
POD0000006204_S0000637 SO THE IDEA OF FREECODECAMP BECOMING KIND OF LIKE LEARN TO CODE AND BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR I THINK IS PROBABLY BEYOND THE SCOPE OF FREECODECAMP BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE THAT'S NECESSARILY POSSIBLE TO DO RE LIAB LY I DO THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD GO OUT AND GET JOBS
POD0000006204_S0000650 YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN B IF THINGS GO SOUTH
POD0000006204_S0000660 YOU HAVE A LOT OF CURR ICULUM
POD0000006204_S0000675 THEN WE HAVE THE FREECODECAMP FORUM AND THAT'S THE THIRD PILLAR OF FREECODECAMP
POD0000006204_S0000696 IF YOU BUILT YOUR OWN JAVASCRIPT GAME FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD SUBMIT THAT
POD0000006204_S0000718 PLACES LIKE THAT
POD0000006204_S0000729 YOUR RECENT ARTICLES ABOUT IT ON FREECODECAMP NEWS
POD0000006204_S0000742 SO THOSE ARE THINGS WHERE WE'VE ALMOST HAD TO TAILOR THE INSTRUCTION TO THE MEDIUM AND THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE MEDIUM
POD0000006204_S0000771 THERE'LL BE A LOT MORE REPETITION THAN THERE IS CURRENTLY
POD0000006204_S0000790 WHEN YOU HAVE A SOLUTION TO MANAGE FEATURE FLAGS AT SCALE
POD0000006204_S0000796 YOU CAN TOGGLE FEATURES
POD0000006204_S0000810 EXHAUS T
POD0000006204_S0000815 BUT FOCUSING COMPLETELY ON THE PROJECT OR IENTATION BECAUSE THAT IS MORE FUN AND THAT THE MOTIVATION IS SO IMPORTANT THERE
POD0000006204_S0000828 PEOPLE DON'T SIT DOWN AND START MEMORIZING EQUATIONS
POD0000006204_S0000849 A LOT OF IT IS NOT SO MUCH A TEACHING ISSUE AS IT IS A COMMUNICATING ISSUE HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE TO THE MIL LIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THE FREECODECAMP CURR ICULUM THAT HEY THIS IS CHANGING
POD0000006204_S0000863 I WORK FULL-TIME BEAU CARNES
POD0000006204_S0000879 ESPECIALLY THE INTERVIEW PRACTICE PREPARATION SECTIONS
POD0000006204_S0000894 NOW IN ADDITION TO THEM WE HAVE DOZENS OF MONTHLY ACTIVE CODE CONTR IBUTORS WHO ARE CONTR IBUTING CODE DIRECTLY TO THE FREECODECAMP PLATFORM
POD0000006204_S0000910 MOST OF THOSE HAVE COME FROM OUTSIDE OF THE FREECODECAMP FULL-TIME STAFF
POD0000006204_S0000925 IT'S SPRAW LING
POD0000006204_S0000945 SO THERE ARE DIMINISHING RETURNS TO WHAT YOU CAN GET FROM FOCUSING ON DIFFERENT AREAS
POD0000006204_S0000953 WOULD BE CODE RADIO
POD0000006204_S0000987 AGAIN IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BE INSPIRATIONA L
POD0000006204_S0001010 OR SOME OF THE MORE CONTEMPORARY DEVELOPERS
POD0000006204_S0001023 GIVE ME SOME SUBTLE TIPS ABOUT HOW TO MANAGE THIS KIND OF WORK
POD0000006204_S0001047 AND FOR AUDIOBOOKS
POD0000006204_S0001058 THAT SOMEBODY'S THAT'S HOW THEY SURVIVE FOR THE ENTIRE MONTH
POD0000006204_S0001086 PROBABLY FOR THE BETTER
POD0000006204_S0001098 LIKE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
POD0000006204_S0001111 AND WE EDIT EVERYTHING THAT GETS PUBLISHED ON OUR PUBLICATION WE ARE VERY SELECTIVE ABOUT WHOM WE LET BE AN AUTHOR
POD0000006204_S0001119 IF YOU WEREN'T WORKING ON FREECODECAMP
POD0000006204_S0001126 BUT I THINK IT GOES HAND-IN-HAND WITH HELPING PEOPLE GET TWENTY FIRST CENTURY JOBS
POD0000006204_S0001139 AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SEE THAT AND I'LL ALMOST CERTAINLY RE-TWEET IT AS WEL L
POD0000006204_S0001146 AS SOFTWARE BUILDERS YOU HAVE THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO UNLOCK THE VALUE OF YOUR DATA TO USERS THROUGH YOUR PRODUCT OR YOUR SERVICE
POD0000006212_S0000003 DENNARD SCALING IS ALSO COMING TO AN END
POD0000006212_S0000008 WHEREAS SOFTWARE ENGINEERS WRITING CODE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMFORTABLY ABLE TO PROJECT THAT THEIR CODE WOULD GET SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER TO RUN OVER TIME DUE TO HARDWARE ADVANCES
POD0000006212_S0000018 ENGINEERS ARE DEVELOPING DOMAIN SPECIFIC CHIPS WHICH ARE OPTIMIZED FOR THOSE MACHINE LEARNING WORKLOADS
POD0000006212_S0000025 YOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE TOOLS THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW SO JUST HELM AND MOVE APPLICATIONS TO ANY KUBERNETES DEPLOYMENT INTEGRATE WITH YOUR CHOICE OF CONTAINER REGISTRY INCLUDING AZURE CONTAINER REGISTRY
POD0000006212_S0000043 THAT THE TIME BETWEEN DEPLOYING NEW FAB LINES IS BEGINNING TO SLOW DOWN
POD0000006212_S0000058 IF IT ONLY LASTS THREE HOURS REMEMBER THE EARLY CELLPHONES WHICH YOU BASICALLY IF YOU USE THEM HEAVILY DURING THE DAY THEY'D RUN OUT OF POWER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
POD0000006212_S0000076 IF YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THAT COMPUTE POWER USING TRADITIONAL GENERAL PURPOSE PROCESSORS
POD0000006212_S0000082 IF YOU'VE GOT AN APPLICATION THAT'S PARALLEL AND RUNS MOST OF THE TIME ON A HUNDRED PROCESSORS
POD0000006212_S0000097 IT HAS TWO DOWNSIDES
POD0000006212_S0000110 HAVE THEM MEDIATE THEIR SHARED UNDERSTANDING
POD0000006212_S0000127 YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A LOT OF VERSIONS OF THOSE
POD0000006212_S0000139 FOR MANY OF YOU YOUR POSTGRESSQL DATABASE IS THE HEART OF YOUR APPLICATION
POD0000006212_S0000145 CITUS CAN PARALLELIZE YOUR SQL QUERIES ACROSS MULTIPLE NODES
POD0000006212_S0000152 COMPANIES LIKE ALGOLIA PROSPERWORKS AND CISCO ARE ALL USING CITUS
POD0000006212_S0000160 YOU DO SMALLER DESIGNS YOU ITERATE MORE
POD0000006212_S0000171 THE PROBLEM WITH TRAINING THE TRAINING WHICH IS THE OTHER HALF OF BUILDING A MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM
POD0000006212_S0000191 SWAMP CONVENTIONAL PROCESSORS IN TERMS OF THEIR EFFICIENCY AND THEIR POWER EFFICIENCY
POD0000006212_S0000200 I'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GO FROM THAT TENSORFLOW REPRESENTATION TO THE DOMAIN-SPECIFIC REPRESENTATION
POD0000006212_S0000218 LET'S BUILD THE SYSTEM THAT DOES THIS
POD0000006212_S0000232 THE PROGRAM CAN'T TELL YOU WHY THAT'S A CAT AND NOT A DOG RIGHT
POD0000006212_S0000249 BUT WE'RE BEGINNING TO GET THERE AND I THINK WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THINGS WHICH THE SYSTEM BEGINS TO MAYBE IT DOESN'T PASS THE MOST RIGOROUS TURING TESTS
POD0000006212_S0000270 I CAN LEARN WHAT YOU THINK OF AS SPAM
POD0000006212_S0000283 LISTENERS OF THIS PODCAST WILL ALSO RECEIVE A FREE DATADOG T-SHIRT
POD0000006212_S0000294 FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT COMMUNICATING DATA IS THE MOST ENERGY EXPENSIVE THING YOU DO
POD0000006212_S0000300 IF I CAN GET YOU AN ANSWER LOCALLY BY CACHING OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM
POD0000006212_S0000311 BUT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO BUILD A GENERAL-PURPOSE COMPUTING STRUCTURE UNLESS WE CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS WITH IT
POD0000006212_S0000338 THAT CAN ALL BE DONE IN A DISTRIBUTED MANNER USING THESE TECHNOLOGIES
POD0000006212_S0000357 ALTAVISTA WAS GREAT I THOUGHT IT WAS SUCH AN IMPROVEMENT WE HAD WEB CRAWLING WE HAD ALL THESE THINGS
POD0000006212_S0000369 WHAT ARE THE NEW SKILLS YOU'VE TRIED TO DEVELOP AS CHAIRMAN
POD0000006212_S0000390 THIS IS DIFFERENT COMPANIES TOO
POD0000006212_S0000400 YES EXACTLY
POD0000006212_S0000410 WE OWE THEM A SECURE ENVIRONMENT THAT PROVIDES WHATEVER LEVEL OF PRIVACY THEY WANT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT JOHN HENNESSY THANKS FOR COMING ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY IT'S BEEN GREAT TALKING TO YOU THANKS JEFF I'VE REALLY ENJOYED IT
POD0000006220_S0000006 IS THERE A BETTER ALTERNATIVE TO ALL OF THESE COMPANIES BECOMING SOFTWARE COMPANIES
POD0000006220_S0000012 COMPANIES BECAME MORE CAUTIOUS ABOUT OUTSOURCING THEIR ENGINEERING WORK
POD0000006220_S0000017 OFF THE-SHELF COLLABORATION TOOLS MAKE IT MUCH EASIER TO COMMUNICATE THE REQUIREMENTS OF A PROJECT TO A TEAM OF DEVELOPERS
POD0000006220_S0000024 YOU CAN HEAR ALL OF OUR OLD EPISODES THEY'RE EASILY ORGANIZED BY CATEGORY
POD0000006220_S0000032 I'M JEFF AT SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM
POD0000006220_S0000039 AND TRACK YOUR USERS THROUGH YOUR APPLICATION TO IDENTIFY THE BAD EXPERIENCES THAT THEY ARE HAVING
POD0000006220_S0000045 TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR COMPANY GIGSTER
POD0000006220_S0000062 MAYBE A BIT FRIENDLIER
POD0000006220_S0000085 ONE IS QUITE SIMPLY THE ROADMAP
POD0000006220_S0000093 THE PROJECT NEEDED FOR IBM HAD TO BE COMPLETED IN TWO AND A HALF WEEKS AND THEY WEREN'T EQUIPPED TO DO THAT INTERNALLY
POD0000006220_S0000121 WE CALL IT THE WORLD'S ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT TOO
POD0000006220_S0000142 WE DON'T DO AGILE WORK EVERYTHING WE DO IS CLOSER TO WATERFALL
POD0000006220_S0000155 YOU PUSH A BUTTON AND THE APP FINDS YOU THE BEST PERSON
POD0000006220_S0000164 I ALMOST WANT TO USE IT LIKE A CONSUMER PRODUCT
POD0000006220_S0000178 WE AGGREGATE ALL THESE DATA AND WE CAN GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE PROJECT WENT
POD0000006220_S0000191 GREAT DEVELOPERS DON'T WANT TO ALSO HAVE TO DO PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND
POD0000006220_S0000211 WITH DEVELOPMENT
POD0000006220_S0000226 SPRINGONE PLATFORM IS THE PREMIER CONFERENCE FOR THOSE WHO BUILD DEPLOY AND RUN CLOUD NATIVE SOFTWARE
POD0000006220_S0000246 WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO GET US TO FREELANCE
POD0000006220_S0000255 THEY DON'T OFTEN WANT TO ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH THE CLIENT
POD0000006220_S0000267 WE HAVE A LOT OF STARTUP FOUNDERS THAT ARE LOOKING TO KIND OF PAY THE BILLS ON THE SIDE
POD0000006220_S0000277 WHEREAS WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW THAT OPTIMIZES AND AUGMENTS HUMAN PROJECT MANAGERS
POD0000006220_S0000284 BECAUSE THEY GET ON THE PHONE AND CRACK JOKES WITH THEM THERE'S A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP
POD0000006220_S0000310 THAT PUSHED US INTO HIGHER MARKETS
POD0000006220_S0000339 HAVE YOU HAD TO BUILD AN OUTBOUND SALES MODEL
POD0000006220_S0000352 WE ACTUALLY WANTED THE SALESPEOPLE TO BE FREELANCERS
POD0000006220_S0000358 WE WOULD TAKE THE THREE-MINUTE SALESPEOPLE
POD0000006220_S0000367 THOSE SALESPEOPLE DIDN'T ALWAYS ACT IN THE CUSTOMER'S BEST INTEREST
POD0000006220_S0000380 SOMETIMES I COME IN THROUGH BOARD MEMBERS MARC BENIOFF IS ONE OF OUR INVESTORS
POD0000006220_S0000407 AND I'M GOING TO TAKE THE RESOURCES BEHIND ME AND I'M GOING TO DEVELOP AN INCREDIBLE NEW PRODUCT OR FEATURE OR SPINOFF A NEW BUSINESS
POD0000006229_S0000008 AVOID BEING LOCKED INTO ANY ONE VENDOR OR RESOURCE
POD0000006229_S0000013 ALL WHILE INCREASING THE SECURITY RELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF CRITICAL BUSINESS WORKLOADS WITH AZURE
POD0000006229_S0000056 BASICALLY GLUE THIS TYPE OF APPLICATION TOGETHER TO ONE APPLICATION
POD0000006229_S0000069 THAT'S ONE OPTION
POD0000006229_S0000099 SO WHAT IS GLOO
POD0000006229_S0000122 SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN ROUTE TO A FUNCTION
POD0000006229_S0000160 I WANT TO PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF A LARGE ENTERPRISE THAT IS DOING THIS CLOUD NATIVE OR A MICROSERVICES MIGRATION TO THEIR THEY'RE DOING CONTAINERIZATION THEY'RE BUILDING OUT CICD PIPELINE
POD0000006229_S0000189 WHICH IS BASICALLY DEBUGGER FOR DISTRIBUTED APPLICATION
POD0000006229_S0000209 THAT'S ONE ONE OPTION
POD0000006229_S0000251 WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST TO SUCK THE INFORMATION THAT HE HAS AND BASICALLY TAKE OVER
POD0000006229_S0000266 AGAIN MUCH EASIER TO SHOW
POD0000006229_S0000320 WHAT WE DID IS WE BASICALLY WENT IN KUBERNETES
POD0000006229_S0000337 GIVE YOUR TEAM BACK THE TIME IT NEEDS TO BUILD BETTER PRODUCTS
POD0000006229_S0000343 STACK OVERFLOW FOR TEAMS GIVES YOUR TEAM THE ANSWERS THEY NEED TO BE PRODUCTIVE WITH THE SAME INTERFACE THAT STACK OVERFLOW USERS ARE FAMILIAR WITH
POD0000006229_S0000378 PLUS MINUS AND MULTIPLY IT WILL GO TO THE MONOLITHIC AN WHEN THE CUSTOMER WILL THE CLIENT RIGHT NOW WILL CALL DIVIDE
POD0000006229_S0000399 LIKE ONE BIG VIRTUAL CLOUD
POD0000006229_S0000413 I DON'T NEED TO RUN MY INSTANCE TO THERE FOR INSTANCE
POD0000006229_S0000437 WHICH IS BASICALLY GOING BETWEEN
POD0000006229_S0000457 SEND ME AN EMAIL JEFF AT SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
POD0000006229_S0000465 THEN LOOK AT SPONSORING THE SHOW THROUGH YOUR COMPANY
POD0000006237_S0000008 WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR IMPORTANT TOPICS TO COVER IN THE WORLD OF SOFTWARE
POD0000006237_S0000016 GO TO SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH G TWO I TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT G TWO I HAS TO OFFER
POD0000006237_S0000022 THEY KNOW HOW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT WORKS THEY CAN HELP YOU FIND THE PERFECT ENGINEER FOR YOUR STACK
POD0000006237_S0000047 THEIR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE
POD0000006237_S0000059 WHY
POD0000006237_S0000076 THEN THE FIREWALL POLICIES IN CLOUD ARE NOT SIMILAR
POD0000006237_S0000103 WHERE EXACTLY THE PROBLEM LIES
POD0000006237_S0000131 AND YOU COULD IN FACT USE THAT REPORT TO GO BACK TO YOUR COMPLIANCE TEAM AND SAY HEY IT ACTUALLY STILL COMPLIES
POD0000006237_S0000140 IT CREATES HIGHLY READABLE AND MAINTAINABLE JAVASCRIPT TESTS
POD0000006237_S0000148 DOES THAT CREATE ANY NETWORKING CHALLENGES THAT ARE SIGNIFI CANTLY DIFFERENT FROM VM-BASED INFRASTRUCTURE JUST AS AN EXAMPLE
POD0000006237_S0000166 WE ARE PRETTY MATURE IN OUR INTEGRATION BECAUSE WE HAVE LEARNED VERY EARLY ON AS WE DECIDED THAT ANY PRODUCT THAT WE BUILD ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS LIKE SAY
POD0000006237_S0000193 THEY WERE ONLY IN SOUTHERN AMERICA AND THEN THEY ARE TRYING OUT IN LET'S SAY ASIA COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ZONE FOR THEM AND TERRITORY FOR THEM
POD0000006237_S0000215 THEY MAY ONLY BE OFFERING GAMING SERVICES IN ONE PART OF THE GLOBE
POD0000006237_S0000235 SAME THING IN ASIA
POD0000006237_S0000242 AND ALL OF THAT IS NETWORKING AND SECURITY IN ADDITION TO HOW WE BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE
POD0000006237_S0000277 AND THAT WE EXPOSE USING THIS PRODUCT THAT I DESCRIBED
POD0000006237_S0000299 AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER TO ALL OF THESE KINDS OF ENTERPRISES
POD0000006237_S0000317 NOT SO MUCH BUSINESS IMPACTING TO SOMETHING WHICH IS REALLY KEEP THE LIGHTS ON FOR THE BUSINESS RIGHT
POD0000006237_S0000339 THEN THEY WILL HAVE A PRODUCT LIKE LET'S SAY SERVICE DIRECTORY
POD0000006237_S0000352 CAN YOU GIVE ME A VIEW OF UTILIZATION OF MY CURRENT LINK AND CAN YOU SUGGEST TO ME AS THIS LINK UTILIZATION GOES BEYOND A CERTAIN THRESHOLD
POD0000006237_S0000362 THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY DO THINGS
POD0000006237_S0000391 SO ABSOLUTELY
POD0000006237_S0000413 I'LL SPEAK BECAUSE IT'S LAST YEAR I WILL ONLY TALK ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE IN GOOGLE CLOUD
POD0000006237_S0000429 LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCES OF EACH OTHER
POD0000006237_S0000439 DATADOG MAKES IT EASY TO COLLABORATE TOGETHER AND MONITOR EVERY LAYER OF THEIR STACK WITHIN A SINGLE PLATFORM
POD0000006245_S0000005 AN ENGINEER AT A SAAS COMPANY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE COST TO PROVIDE A SERVICE MIGHT SCALE SO THAT THE SALES TEAM CAN DECIDE ON APPROPRIATE PRICING FOR THAT SERVICE
POD0000006245_S0000012 HE HAD SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE FROM ENGINEERING
POD0000006245_S0000017 IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH US AND ADVERTISING SOME OF THOSE POSTINGS YOU CAN SEND ME AN EMAIL
POD0000006245_S0000024 IF YOU'RE SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY ON YOUR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE CHECK OUT DOIT INTERNATIONAL
POD0000006245_S0000031 THEY CAN HELP YOU RUN YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE MORE EFFICIENTLY BY HELPING YOU USE COMMITMENTS SPOT INSTANCES RIGHTSIZING AND UNIQUE PURCHASING TECHNIQUES
POD0000006245_S0000039 YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN HISTORY AND PROFESSION THAN A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT COME ON THIS SHOW MOST PEOPLE THAT COME ON THIS SHOW ARE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS
POD0000006245_S0000046 WHAT OUR TECHNOLOGY DOES FOR WHOM WHY IT DOES IT
POD0000006245_S0000055 SO SOME OF THE BUSINESS MODELS RESURFACE IT'S JUST TECHNOLOGY CHANGES HOW THEY GET EXECUTED
POD0000006245_S0000067 MAYBE SUMMARIZE IT AT A HIGH LEVEL
POD0000006245_S0000074 IF THE TECHNOLOGY ISN'T QUITE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE BEST PRODUCT MARKET FIT
POD0000006245_S0000089 THEN I STILL I'M GOING TO BE AT A DISADVANTAGE OF NOT GOING TO BE EXECUTING AS WELL AS A COMPANY
POD0000006245_S0000094 SO MANY TIMES WITH EARLY STAGE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS
POD0000006245_S0000105 HOW DO I GET THAT MESSAGE OUT
POD0000006245_S0000115 SURE
POD0000006245_S0000133 SO SPRING BECAME HEAVILY USED BY DEVELOPERS
POD0000006245_S0000156 SO THE PACE IS MOVING SO FAST
POD0000006245_S0000166 SO THROUGH THAT SINGLE DOORWAY WE SPRINGSOURCE COULD GIVE VMWARE ACCESS OR PROVIDE VMWARE ACCESS TO ALL THESE SPRING DEVELOPERS BECAUSE THEY WERE COMING TO SPRINGSOURCE TO AGAIN UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY BETTER
POD0000006245_S0000173 THOSE WERE THE FOUNDATIONAL COMPONENTS NOT ALL BUT THE FOUNDATIONAL COMPONENTS FOR WHAT IS NOW PIVOTAL SOFTWARE
POD0000006245_S0000186 AND THE BUSINESS TEAM THAT WAS LED BY ROB BEARDEN
POD0000006245_S0000201 IT'S NOT UNLIKE WHY DID SATYA NADELLA RECENTLY BUY GITHUB
POD0000006245_S0000209 AND I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE FOCUS ON USER EXPERIENCE THE GREAT DOCUMENTATION AND THE SIMPLE USER INTERFACE
POD0000006245_S0000218 THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO EXPERIMENT WITH
POD0000006245_S0000229 AND THIS IS THE TRICK IF I WAS GOING TO SAY TRICK BUT IT'S NOT DECEIVING
POD0000006245_S0000237 HELPING A COMPANY UNDERSTAND SO IF I'M A YOUNG TECHNOLOGY COMPANY
POD0000006245_S0000244 AND THEY FELT THAT GIVEN THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO OWN IT
POD0000006245_S0000260 IT REALLY MADE VMFORCE IRRELEVANT
POD0000006245_S0000272 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR STRATEGY IS AROUND THAT I HAVEN'T STUDIED IT BUT YOU CAN SEE CERTAINLY THE COMPANY IS WILDLY SUCCESSFUL AND THEY'RE CONTINUING TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS LOOK AT THE RECENT MULESOFT ACQUISITION
POD0000006245_S0000283 I JOINED HORTONWORKS RUNNING BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
POD0000006245_S0000296 SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID TO QUICKLY ESTABLISH OURSELVES IN THE MARKET IS SAY OUR HADOOP DISTRIBUTION IS GOING TO BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OPEN SOURCE
POD0000006245_S0000311 IF I'M GOING TO BRING HADOOP IN
POD0000006245_S0000331 I THINK ONE OF OUR COMPETITORS WAS TRYING TO COMPETE WITH HADOOP WITH THEIR OWN PROPRIETARY FILE SYSTEM
POD0000006245_S0000344 IS VERY HARD
POD0000006245_S0000360 THE SECOND KEY RELATIONSHIP THAT WE ESTABLISHED WAS WITH MICROSOFT
POD0000006245_S0000374 DO YOU HAVE ANY STRATEGIC EVALUATIONS OR WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING IF YOU WERE AT EITHER OF THESE COMPANIES
POD0000006245_S0000388 THEY'RE THE MAIN KAFKA COMPANY
POD0000006245_S0000414 I'VE BEEN TO A COUPLE OF THE KUBECON KUBERNETES CONFERENCES
POD0000006245_S0000423 AMAZON AND MICROSOFT
POD0000006245_S0000432 SO THEN I THINK IF I'M A YOUNG TECHNOLOGY COMPANY
POD0000006245_S0000442 WHERE I'VE GOT GOOD FRIENDS OVER THERE FROM HORTONWORKS AND THEY'RE EXECUTING EXTREMELY WELL AS A COMPANY THAT ORIGINALLY WERE COMPETING WITH KUBERNETES WITH NOMAD BUT NOW VERY MUCH EMBRACING STILL SUPPORTING NOMAD BUT VERY MUCH EMBRACING KUBERNETES
POD0000006245_S0000458 THOSE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE CLOUD VENDORS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TO MANAGE OR CONTROL THE VOICE OF THE CUSTOMER
POD0000006245_S0000473 JUST TO NAME A FEW ZOOM
POD0000006245_S0000487 FIVE YEARS IS A LONG TIME
POD0000006245_S0000495 FOR BLOCKCHAIN TO REALLY TAKE OFF IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOLUTION-BASED
POD0000006245_S0000506 AS A CORE INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MORE PREVALENT
POD0000006245_S0000516 JUST BECAUSE MY APP IS A KUBERNETES-BASED APP
POD0000006245_S0000526 BUT WHEN YOUR FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN AS A YOUNG TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AND YOU'RE BURNING CASH AND YOU HAVE A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE OR BREAK A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
POD0000006245_S0000536 TODAY I WOULD SAY IF YOU ARE A YOUNG TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE COMPANY
POD0000006245_S0000549 I THINK WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT YOUNGER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TODAY AND THIS IS NOT AT ALL A CRITICISM
POD0000006245_S0000556 AND TO WHOM IS THAT OF VALUE TO AND WHY IS THAT OF VALUE TO THEM
POD0000006245_S0000564 AND WHY THAT SHOULD BE OF VALUE TO THEM AND HOW I AM COMMUNICATING OR INTERACTING WITH THOSE PEOPLE PRODUCT SALES
POD0000006245_S0000573 PART OF THAT PRODUCT MARKET FIT IS PRODUCT PACKAGING AS WELL AS LICENSING MODEL
POD0000006245_S0000583 SO
POD0000006245_S0000596 THAT NOT ONLY HELPS THEM MAINTAIN THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY AND NURTURE THAT OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY WITH AN OPEN SOURCE LICENSE
POD0000006245_S0000606 BECAUSE THESE ENTERPRISES WERE SAYING HOLD IT I CAN'T BRING THIS OPEN-SOURCE TECHNOLOGY IN
POD0000006245_S0000613 THE COMPETITIVE NATURE IN THE MARKET
POD0000006245_S0000628 OKAY
POD0000006245_S0000643 INTEGRATE WITH YOUR CHOICE OF CONTAINER REGISTRY INCLUDING AZURE CONTAINER REGISTRY
POD0000006253_S0000005 TO PERFORM AN OPERATION
POD0000006253_S0000011 SECURITY VULNERABILITIES CAN EMERGE FROM THIS WIDE ATTACK SURFACE OF DIFFERENT SYSCALLS AND MOST APPLICATIONS ONLY NEED A SMALL NUMBER OF SYSCALLS TO PROVIDE THEIR REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY
POD0000006253_S0000017 BY INSERTING AN INTERPRETER INTERFACE BETWEEN CONTAINERS AND THE LINUX KERNEL
POD0000006253_S0000028 AS WELL AS THE SE DAILY OLD SCHOOL BUCKET HAT
POD0000006253_S0000039 WHETHER YOU'RE BUILDING AN APP FOR MILLIONS OF USERS
POD0000006253_S0000061 WE HAD A SESSION ABOUT GKE SANDBOX THERE I ACTUALLY HAVE SLIDES ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE
POD0000006253_S0000072 WITHIN GOOGLE CORE INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF
POD0000006253_S0000091 NOW INITIALLY
POD0000006253_S0000137 DO THEY NOT HAVE GOOD STRATEGIES FOR SHARING RESOURCES TODAY OH
POD0000006253_S0000188 LET'S GET TO TALKING ABOUT GVISOR EXPLAIN WHAT GVISOR IS
POD0000006253_S0000212 IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTAIN IN THAT SITUATION THE MULTI-TENANT SITUATION YOU DO WANT ISOLATE BETWEEN THOSE TENANT WORKLOADS
POD0000006253_S0000240 FILTER TO A SPECIFIC DOCKER IMAGE OR DRILL DOWN BY KUBERNETES SERVICE TO GET FINE-GRAINED VISIBILITY INTO YOUR CONTAINER INFRASTRUCTURE
POD0000006253_S0000257 THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT'S IN PUBLIC THAT COULD BE INTERESTING
POD0000006253_S0000279 CONTAINERS THEMSELVES ARE NOT A SANDBOX EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS
POD0000006253_S0000344 KEY MANAGEMENT
POD0000006253_S0000357 WHAT ABOUT SECURITY AND HOSTING AND MAINTENANCE
POD0000006253_S0000362 YOU CAN EXPLORE ALL THE RESOURCES ON THE WIX CODE SITE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WEB DEVELOPMENT WHEREVER YOU ARE IN YOUR DEVELOPER CAREER
POD0000006261_S0000009 A FEW EXAMPLES OF DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED USING HELM ARE KAFKA PROMETHEUS
POD0000006261_S0000016 IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A JOB CHECK OUT SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH ACCENTURE
POD0000006261_S0000025 GROW YOUR CAREER WHILE CONTINUOUSLY LEARNING CREATING AND APPLYING NEW CLOUD SOLUTIONS NOW APPLY FOR A JOB TODAY BY GOING TO SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH ACCENTURE
POD0000006261_S0000045 THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE
POD0000006261_S0000076 I THINK IT'S JUST LIKE
POD0000006261_S0000103 THESE THINGS CAN'T FULLY CAPTURE WHO YOU ARE
POD0000006261_S0000110 ZOOM
POD0000006261_S0000126 HOW DO I CONFIGURE IT SLIGHTLY JUST TO YOU KNOW
POD0000006261_S0000137 IT CAME OUT OF A HACKATHON ACTUALLY WHEN WE WERE FIRST STARTING TO WORK ON DEIS WORKFLOW
POD0000006261_S0000159 YOU'VE GOT THE VALUES WHICH ARE USER SUPPLIED CONFIGURATION YOU HAVE A RELEASE
POD0000006261_S0000176 THAT'S CHART AND METADATA
POD0000006261_S0000209 IT WILL GIVE YOU A DOCKER FILE A BASE DOCKER FILE TO WORK WITH
POD0000006261_S0000233 THEY CAN HELP YOU RUN YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE MORE EFFICIENTLY BY HELPING YOU USE COMMITMENTS SPOT INSTANCES RIGHT SIZING AND UNIQUE PURCHASING TECHNIQUES
POD0000006261_S0000262 YEAH THAT'S SUCH AND INTERESTING AND INTRIGUING QUESTION AS WELL
POD0000006261_S0000287 I ALSO HEAR ABOUT MANY NEWER HUNGRY SOFTWARE ENGINEERS WHO ARE LOOKING TO LEVEL UP QUICKLY AND PROVE THEMSELVES
POD0000006269_S0000009 THIS TRANSFORMATION OF CAPITAL EXPENSE INTO OPERATIONAL EXPENSE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED THE BARRIER TO ENTRY TO STARTING SOFTWARE COMPANIES
POD0000006269_S0000014 CLOUD PROVIDERS BUY THOUSANDS OF SERVERS AND BUILD DATA CENTERS AROUND THE WORLD
POD0000006269_S0000022 THE LOGICAL UNIT OF A SERVER COMES WITH THE RISK THAT THAT SERVER WILL CRASH OR WILL BE HACKED OR WILL DEVELOP A BUG THAT IS DIFFICULT TO SOLVE AND MANAGED SERVICES ABSTRACT AWAY THE NOTION OF A SERVER
POD0000006269_S0000031 BUT WE'RE STILL PRETTY FAR FROM THAT TIME
POD0000006269_S0000038 KUBERNETES ON THE OTHER HAND IS A TOOL FOR MANAGING CONTAINERIZED INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS FULLY READY FOR ADOPTION BY LOTS OF PEOPLE
POD0000006269_S0000047 BASICALLY ALL OF THE CLOUD PROVIDERS
POD0000006269_S0000052 AND WE'RE BUILDING A NEW WAY TO CONSUME CONTENT ABOUT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
POD0000006269_S0000062 WITH CONTINUOUS BACK-UP VPC PEERING
POD0000006269_S0000071 NO CREDIT CARD IS REQUIRED
POD0000006269_S0000088 THESE HYBRID CLOUD COMPANIES WHAT DO THEY DO FOR THE CLOUD AND WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THEIR ON PREM INFRASTRUCTURE HOW DOES THAT DIVISION OF LABOR BETWEEN THEIR RESOURCES MANIFEST IN THE HYBRID CLOUD MODEL
POD0000006269_S0000125 WHETHER YOU'RE ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR A JOB OR YOU NEED INSIGHTS TO GROW IN YOUR CURRENT ROLE DICE HAS THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED
POD0000006269_S0000145 TALK ABOUT THE OPERATIONS MODEL OF THE IBM CLOUD LIKE WHAT'S THE DIVISION OF LABOR LOOK LIKE
POD0000006269_S0000168 CONTAINERS HAVE BECOME THE DEPLOYMENT UNIT OF CHOICE
POD0000006269_S0000191 IT'S GOING TO TAKE UP THIS LARGE BLOCK OF SPACE AND I'M PROBABLY NOT GOING TO UTILIZE THAT SPACE TO CAPACITY
POD0000006269_S0000215 YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE HOW DO I ADD OR REMOVE CAPACITY FROM THAT ENVIRONMENT
POD0000006269_S0000233 DEVELOPERS LISTEN TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE LATEST STRATEGIES AND TOOLS FOR BUILDING SOFTWARE
POD0000006269_S0000238 IF YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT BECOMING A SPONSOR SEND ME AN EMAIL
POD0000006269_S0000253 SECURITY
POD0000006269_S0000265 THERE'S A LOT OF METADATA THAT'S GENERATED AND YOU WANT TO USE THAT METADATA TO MAKE DECISIONS
POD0000006269_S0000271 IN THE PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT NO APPLICATIONS SHOULD GET DEPLOYED THAT HAS A VULNERABLE IMAGE OR WHOSE IMAGE HAS NOT PASSED THE VULNERABILITY SCAN
POD0000006269_S0000299 VALIDATE THAT EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD AND THEN MAYBE GRADUALLY ROLL PEOPLE ON TO IT
POD0000006269_S0000319 KUBERNETES WILL NOT HANDLE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SERVICE B FAILS AND SERVICE A DEPENDS ON IT
POD0000006269_S0000343 IN WHICH CASE YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT ANY ONE SOURCE YOU KIND OF THINK ABOUT THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS LIKE GOING TO A FUNCTIONS PLATFORM AND DEFINING AN APPLICATION WHICH IS A SEQUENCE OF FUNCTIONS THAT RESPOND TO A CHAIN OF EVENTS MAKES SENSE AS A DEVELOPER
POD0000006269_S0000384 THEN THAT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN USER EXPERIENCE RIGHT
POD0000006269_S0000394 AND TRACK YOUR USERS THROUGH YOUR APPLICATION TO IDENTIFY THE BAD EXPERIENCES THAT THEY ARE HAVING
POD0000006277_S0000005 SOFTWARE TEAMS RESPOND TO AN INCIDENT BY ISSUING A FIX
POD0000006277_S0000010 RATHER THAN A SURPRISING AND PAINFUL OUTAGE TAMMY BUTOW IS AN ENGINEER WITH GREMLIN
POD0000006277_S0000015 FINDCOLLABS IS THE COMPANY I'M WORKING ON
POD0000006277_S0000020 IT'S ALSO A GREAT PLACE TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER PEOPLE ON LOW CODE OR NO CODE PROJECTS
POD0000006277_S0000026 LIKE GREMLIN
POD0000006277_S0000033 THAT'S SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH DATADOG
POD0000006277_S0000052 DO YOU HAVE ANY GENERAL LESSONS ABOUT HOW TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS THAT YOU'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST YEAR
POD0000006277_S0000098 HOW DO WE MAKE SYSTEMS MORE SCALABLE
POD0000006277_S0000133 I STOPPED IN VERY BRIEFLY AND I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH KOLTON WHO IS THE CEO OF GREMLIN
POD0000006277_S0000146 THEN YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO I BEST PRESENT THIS INFORMATION WITHIN MY ORGANIZATION WHO ARE THE PEOPLE THAT I NEED TO SPEAK WITH
POD0000006277_S0000171 OR SOMEBODY IN AN ORGANIZATION IS TRYING TO GET BUY-IN TO ADOPT CHAOS ENGINEERING
POD0000006277_S0000199 OR ARE INCIDENTS HIGHLY VARIABLE
POD0000006277_S0000216 MACHINES GOING DOWN AND THERE'S NO AUTOMATION TO BRING THEM BACK UP
POD0000006277_S0000230 THEN LOOK AT THOSE TWO BUCKETS AND GO WELL WHAT WERE THE IMPACT OF THOSE INCIDENTS
POD0000006277_S0000243 TRAIN UP EVERYBODY SO EVERYONE FEELS CONFIDENT WHEN THEY'RE ON-CALL HELP US REDUCE OUTAGES HELP US IMPROVE OUR MEANTIME TO DETECTION MEANTIME TO RESOLUTION AND REALLY PUT FORWARD THE CASE FOR WHY YOU WANT TO DO IT HOW IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BENEFIT YOUR COMPANY
POD0000006277_S0000268 FROM HARDWARE TO SOFTWARE
POD0000006277_S0000275 THAT'S GETCRUISE DOT COM SLASH CAREERS
POD0000006277_S0000293 LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF FAILURES
POD0000006277_S0000310 WHAT CHANGES THEY'RE MAKING TO THE SYSTEM
POD0000006277_S0000342 THEN THEY WOULD SAY OH THIS PERSON ACTUALLY DID ALL THESE THINGS WRONG
POD0000006277_S0000376 WAS IT TECHNICAL WAS IT PEOPLE RELATED
POD0000006285_S0000003 THE VIRTUALIZATION LAYER
POD0000006285_S0000010 OPENSTACK
POD0000006285_S0000019 THIS USER-FRIENDLY APP GIVES YOU ACCESS TO NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NEW WAYS
POD0000006285_S0000024 DICE EVEN IDENTIFIES GAPS IN YOUR EXPERIENCE AND SUGGESTS THE SKILLS THAT YOU'LL NEED TO MAKE A SWITCH
POD0000006285_S0000037 MAYBE
POD0000006285_S0000051 AND IT WAS JUST LIKE
POD0000006285_S0000068 BUILDING AN INSTANCE OF A SERVER REQUIRED A LOT OF HANDWORK
POD0000006285_S0000098 THERE IS A HISTORY OF CONFLICTS BETWEEN DEV AND OPS AND I'M CURIOUS HOW THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEVELOPERS AND THE OPERATIONS PEOPLE
POD0000006285_S0000108 I JUST THINK THEY'RE NOT GIVEN THE REQUIREMENTS CLEARLY AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE THEY'RE HIDDEN FROM PRODUCTION
POD0000006285_S0000126 IT'S REALLY AN EXPECTATION THAT DEV IS GOING TO UNDERSTAND OPERATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE A BIT AND VICE VERSA
POD0000006285_S0000133 THESE APPLICATIONS OFTEN REQUIRE DATA WAREHOUSING GLUCODE
POD0000006285_S0000140 ALGORITHMIC AND FRONT END COMPONENTS
POD0000006285_S0000145 OR USE COMPLEX VISUALIZATIONS EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW D THREE
POD0000006285_S0000152 I THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE INFRASTRUCTURE'S CODE
POD0000006285_S0000183 IT'S GOT SOME GREAT FEATURES THAT PEOPLE LIKE AUTO SCALING
POD0000006285_S0000203 THEY WERE USING SOMETHING THAT WORKED INTERNALLY GOOGLE HADN'T RELEASED ANYTHING AT THAT POINT THAT I'M AWARE OF
POD0000006285_S0000217 BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL KIND OF MAKING BETS ON WHAT THIS THING CAN DO WHEREAS VERSUS GOOGLE WHERE IT'S LIKE
POD0000006285_S0000228 WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING BACK AND SAYING
POD0000006285_S0000249 BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE STUFF MANAGER ENVIRONMENT RUNNING IN THE THING THAT'S MANAGING THE ENVIRONMENT
POD0000006285_S0000276 SAY GOODBYE TO DEPLOYMENT PANIC AND HELLO TO CONSISTENT PREDICTABLE DELIVERIES
POD0000006285_S0000324 THEN VERY HEAVY INTO THAT WHEN EARLY IN MY CAREER IT WASN'T THAT WAY I DID NETWORKING AND STORAGE AND SERVERS AND SECURITY
POD0000006293_S0000004 A SUCCESSFUL GAME PLAYER CAN MODEL THEIR ACTIONS MATHEMATICALLY
POD0000006293_S0000010 THE EXPECTED VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS THE SUM OF ALL POTENTIAL PROBABILITY WEIGHTED FUTURE OUTCOMES OF A BUSINESS
POD0000006293_S0000017 THAT INVESTOR WOULD PROBABLY OVERLOOK A BUSINESS LIKE FORWARD
POD0000006293_S0000023 IN MANY PROFESSIONS REASONING BY ANALOGY WILL WORK OUT PERFECTLY FINE
POD0000006293_S0000030 AND EVERY TEAM HAS SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT INTERNAL SOFTWARE
POD0000006293_S0000035 THEY DON'T NEED ANOTHER TOOL THAT THEY WON'T USE
POD0000006293_S0000043 YOU PLAY GAMES YOU PLAY BOARD GAMES AND CARD GAMES AND FIGHTING GAMES AND MOST TABLETOP GAMES ARE SYNCHRONOUS YOU HAVE TIME TO THINK AND BE DELIBERATE IN BOARD GAMES
POD0000006293_S0000050 I HAVE TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING THREE QUESTIONS AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM IS AN EASY QUESTION TO ANSWER
POD0000006293_S0000063 AND I ALWAYS PROTECT THAT AND I ALWAYS CONTINUE TO GET BETTER AT THAT RATHER THAN PUTTING A LOT OF SKILL POINTS INTO OTHER THINGS WHICH IS MAYBE THE RIGHT WAY OF DOING ON THE PROFESSIONAL SIDE BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE BEST ANSWER ON THE PERSONAL SIDE
POD0000006293_S0000085 AGAIN THE IN-GAME EXCHANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS I THINK IS A MATTER OF LIKE WHAT THE CORE GAME IS I THINK IN-GAME EXCHANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME
POD0000006293_S0000098 AND THAT'S GREAT
POD0000006293_S0000118 TO GIVE A SAMPLE FOR YOUR TYPE OF INVESTMENT THAT YOU WOULD MAKE
POD0000006293_S0000127 BUT THOSE ARE MACHINES THAT WERE NOT WRITTEN FOR ENGINEERS
POD0000006293_S0000137 THEY CRAVE LITTLE CARS ZOOMING AROUND ON THE MAP
POD0000006293_S0000142 ON MOBILE PHONES
POD0000006293_S0000152 AND ACCESS MANAGER TO THWART TROLLS AND HACKERS
POD0000006293_S0000169 BRAND IS A MOTE IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE OF FOREVER WINNING
POD0000006293_S0000178 HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE TILL WE SEE IN AI THAT CAN PERFORM WELL IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH THE HIGH DIMENSIONALITY OF THE GAME PIECES
POD0000006293_S0000190 IF YOU WILL THE CURRENT META
POD0000006293_S0000211 AND THAT IS A HUGE ADVANTAGE OF A COMPANY LIKE THAT
POD0000006293_S0000231 BUT REAL BUSINESS KIND OF WAYS
POD0000006293_S0000245 VERSUS HAVING IT BE HIGH-TRANSACTIONAL
POD0000006293_S0000257 WHAT I KNOW IS LONG TERM STRATEGIC VALUE CREATION SO THAT IS ALL THAT I FOCUS ON
POD0000006293_S0000286 I TOOK THE QUIZ AND IT COVERED A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS GENERAL PROGRAMMING ABILITY
POD0000006293_S0000294 WHICH IS WHAT I TRY TO DO WITH SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY MYSELF
POD0000006293_S0000317 BUT IF EVERYBODY THINKS THAT SOMETHING IS AMAZING AND IT'S THE GREATEST THING THEN THAT PRICE IS GOING TO GET BIT UP LIKE CRAZY IT'S GOING TO BE SUPER COMPETITIVE YOUR RETURNS ARE NOT GOING TO COME FROM THAT
POD0000006293_S0000329 AND THAT IS A HARD SKILL
POD0000006293_S0000353 AND WE'VE SEEN VERY VERY FEW OF THOSE
POD0000006293_S0000360 DIVERSIFICATION PROBABLY IS YOUR BEST STRATEGY
POD0000006293_S0000374 WHY IS THAT WHY IS IT TABOO TO HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT PRIVACY AND TECHNOLOGY
POD0000006293_S0000388 NEEDS TO LOOK
POD0000006293_S0000399 I DISAGREE WITH THAT WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION TALKING ABOUT BOARD GAMES
POD0000006293_S0000405 THEY'RE A FIVE-MINUTE GAME THAT'S FINE
POD0000006293_S0000413 HOW CAN I PLAY BETTER AND ACTUALLY WIN
POD0000006293_S0000426 MAGIC THE GATHERING
POD0000006293_S0000441 WITH TWENTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE LISTENING MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AND THE CONTENT BEING FAIRLY SELECTIVE FOR A TECHNICAL LISTENER
POD0000006301_S0000006 JAEGER IS AN OPEN SOURCE DISTRIBUTED TRACING TOOL THAT PROVIDES OBSERVABILITY FEATURES THROUGHOUT UBER S MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE
POD0000006301_S0000011 YOU CAN CHECK OUT THE SOFTWARE DAILY APP FOR IOS OR ANDROID AND YOU CAN SEARCH FOR UBER AND FIND THOSE EPISODES
POD0000006301_S0000019 THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS TO USE MONDAY
POD0000006301_S0000054 SO MESOS
POD0000006301_S0000071 SO I THINK PRIMARILY WE WERE FOCUSING ON SORT OF THE ROUTING FUNCTION OF THE SIDECAR
POD0000006301_S0000084 FOR EXAMPLE LET'S TALK ABOUT DISTRIBUTED TRACING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE AN EXPERT IN
POD0000006301_S0000095 FROM THE FRONTEND LAYER TO THE APPLICATION MIDDLEWARE TO THE BACKEND CORE DATA SERVICES
POD0000006301_S0000101 WHICH IS A QUOTE THAT YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF SAYING ONCE YOU ARE IMPROVING THE LATENCY OF YOUR MULTI-SERVICE REQUESTS
POD0000006301_S0000106 IN THAT SHOW HE TALKED ABOUT HIS EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF DISTRIBUTED TRACING AT GOOGLE
POD0000006301_S0000137 SO IT WAS KIND OF VERY NON-STANDARD SET UP OF ZIPKIN
POD0000006301_S0000163 SO EVERY TIME THIS REQUEST IS PROPAGATED THROUGH SERVICE A AND THEN B AND THEN C AND THEN D
POD0000006301_S0000180 SO

POD0000006301_S0000293 THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A BUSINESS OUTAGE WE NEED TO FIX IT IMMEDIATELY
POD0000006301_S0000342 SOFTWARE BUSINESSES BUILT AROUND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE OPERATE DIFFERENTLY THAN THOSE BUILT AROUND PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE
POD0000006301_S0000347 GO TO OPENCORESUMMIT DOT COM TO REGISTER
POD0000006301_S0000353 MOST BUSINESSES DON'T GAIN THAT MUCH BY HAVING THEIR SOFTWARE BE PROPRIETARY

POD0000006309_S0000006 THE COTTON PICKING MACHINES
POD0000006309_S0000012 AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE
POD0000006309_S0000019 IF YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY FOR A WHILE YOU KNOW THAT THESE SYSTEMS ARE HARD TO BUILD AND THEY TAKE ENGINEERING DETAILS AT BOTH THE HIGH-LEVEL AND AT THE LOW-LEVEL
POD0000006309_S0000026 SO CHECK IT OUT
POD0000006309_S0000050 HEY YOU NEED LET'S DO THIS AMOUNT OF CHEMICAL IN THIS PART OF THE FIELD AND THIS AMOUNT OF CHEMICAL IN THIS OTHER PART OF THE FIELD

POD0000006309_S0000123 HOW HAS ENGINEERING WITHIN JOHN DEERE CHANGED OVER THAT EIGHT YEAR PERIOD THAT YOU'VE BEEN WITH THE COMPANY

POD0000006309_S0000254 IT MIGHT GET UPLOADED AS A SINGLE SOLID FI LE
POD0000006309_S0000282 OR HOW DOES THIS SEED WORK IN THIS KIND OF SOIL VERSUS THIS OTHER KIND OF SOIL
POD0000006309_S0000309 WHICH MEANS THAT CONSUMERS CAN GET A MORTGAGE FASTER
POD0000006309_S0000317 NOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE WITH THE BOTTOMS-UP DEVELOPER FREEDOM
POD0000006309_S0000348 A COMPANY LIKE JOHN DEERE THAT HAS SUCH A HISTORY IN MANUFACTURING
POD0000006309_S0000366 DO ANY KIND UPDATES FOR THEM AT ALL
POD0000006309_S0000390 YOU PROGRAM SOMETHING
POD0000006309_S0000401 AND MICROSOFT AND MANAGE SERVICES
POD0000006309_S0000441 YOU PROBABLY DO NOT ENJOY SEARCHING FOR A JOB

POD0000006317_S0000038 THANK YOU JEFF AND THANKS FOR DATADOG FOR HAVING US
POD0000006317_S0000062 ALICE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HERE
POD0000006317_S0000073 FURTHERMORE
POD0000006317_S0000091 HARD TO FIND PEOPLE'S PUBLIC KEYS
POD0000006317_S0000105 PROBLEM THERE IS THAT NOW YOU HAVE TO TRUST TWITTER
POD0000006317_S0000143 ALICE HAS PROVED HER TWITTER ACCOUNT AND HER GITHUB ACCOUNT
POD0000006317_S0000165 KEYBASE WAS VERY MUCH LIKE A PGP ALMOST LIKE A PGP KEY SERVER
POD0000006317_S0000180 ANYBODY CAN ENCRYPT A MESSAGE TO YOU WITH ANY OF THEM
POD0000006317_S0000190 BECAUSE I CAN SEE ALL THE PREVIOUS ONES BEFORE IT AND THEY ALL HAVE THE PROPER SIGNATURES GOING BACK IN TIME THAT'S BASICALLY HOW THESE SIGCHAINS WORK AS WELL
POD0000006317_S0000206 YOU COULD USE ONE OF THESE PER USER KEYS THAT'S GENERATED ON MY DEVICE
POD0000006317_S0000247 EVERYONE COULD KNOW IT'S TRULY YOU
POD0000006317_S0000266 THEY GET THOSE FILES
POD0000006317_S0000286 YOU CAN VIEW THE REPOS ON MOBILE
POD0000006317_S0000308 COULD KEYBASE BE SOMETHING THAT IS IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO OPTIONS ALONG THAT GRADIENT
POD0000006317_S0000330 JUST BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS THEY PROVIDE AND THIS IDENTITY MODEL WHICH WE THINK IS PRETTY NOVEL
POD0000006317_S0000343 BECAUSE IF YOU'VE LOST ALL YOUR DEVICES
POD0000006317_S0000375 ALL THOSE REQUISITE THINGS AND THEN WE'LL BE BACK AT EIGHT P M SCRATCHERS WE PUT OUT ON YOUR SEATS THEY DO HAVE THOSE FREE PASSES TO DASH
POD0000006317_S0000392 WE HAVE MACHINE LEARNING AS A SERVICE
POD0000006317_S0000413 THE PROBABILITY IS ACTUALLY PRETTY CONVINCING
POD0000006317_S0000436 BUT LET'S MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PART OF THE TALK WHICH IS BASICALLY OUR STACK
POD0000006317_S0000454 BECAUSE A LOT OF CUSTOMERS
POD0000006317_S0000480 WHICH MEANS THAT EVERYONE CAN BE MASTER
POD0000006317_S0000496 CAN BE CITUS WHICH WE USE MANAGE CITUS
POD0000006317_S0000520 AT THAT TIME
POD0000006317_S0000559 THIS FLAG THAT THEY JUST PUT HERE EXPERIMENTAL NVIDIA GPU YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY ADD THIS TO YOUR KUBELET RUN COMMAND
POD0000006317_S0000588 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
POD0000006317_S0000605 THERE'S A LOT MORE TO BE DONE
POD0000006317_S0000617 ANOTHER THING THAT WE REALLY WANT TO SEE IN KUBERNETES IS ACTUALLY DEVICE SHARING
POD0000006317_S0000630 IN YOUR CLUSTER WITH THIS THING
POD0000006317_S0000639 USE IT EVEN MORE
POD0000006317_S0000665 I THINK WE'RE GOOD THANKS HABIB THANK
POD0000006325_S0000008 AS THE CARS DRIVE AROUND THE CITY THEY CAN COMMUNICATE WITH CUSTOM CLOUD SERVICES TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT TRAFFIC NAVIGATION AND WEATHER
POD0000006325_S0000013 KARL ISENBERG IS AN ENGINEER AT CRUISE AND HE JOINS THE SHOW TO TALK ABOUT THE ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS OF BUILDING A SELF-DRIVING CAR SERVICE AS WELL AS CRUISE'S APPROACH TO PLATFORM ENGINEERING
POD0000006325_S0000018 IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WRITING ABOUT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING OR COMPUTER SCIENCE
POD0000006325_S0000024 THEN YOU CAN APPLY FOR THIS PART-TIME ROLE AS WELL
POD0000006325_S0000029 THE COMPANY HAS STUDIED THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF MODERN CONTINUOUS INTELLIGENCE AND THEN COMPILE THAT INFORMATION INTO THE CONTINUOUS INTELLIGENCE REPORT
POD0000006325_S0000037 GO TO SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH SUMOLOGIC AND DOWNLOAD THE CONTINUOUS INTELLIGENCE REPORT TODAY
POD0000006325_S0000058 SINCE JOINING CRUISE AND SEEING WHAT I PRESUME WAS AN ENTIRELY NEW DOMAIN OF COMPANY THAT HAD ITS OWN REQUIREMENTS FOR PLATFORM INFRASTRUCTURE
POD0000006325_S0000071 NETFL IX HAS A GREAT REPUTATION AS A PLATFORM ENGINEERING COMPANY
POD0000006325_S0000076 WE'RE HERE AT KUBECON
POD0000006325_S0000081 IF I'M AN INSURANCE COMPANY SHOULD I HAVE A PLATFORM ENGINEERING TEAM OR SHOULD I SORT OF SAY
POD0000006325_S0000098 BUT MORE COMPLICATED SOLUTIONS WILL NEED TO PEEL BACK THOSE LAYERS AND GO DIRECTLY TO CONTAINERS AND SOME SYSTEMS WILL NEED TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE VMS
POD0000006325_S0000141 YOU WOUND UP GOING ALL IN ON GOOGLE CLOUD
POD0000006325_S0000165 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES INTO CREATING A HYBRID CLOUD
POD0000006325_S0000181 MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED COMPANIES INCLUDING CISCO CAPITAL ONE AND EBAY
POD0000006325_S0000198 GOOGLE GROUPS IS THAT LIKE AN EMAIL LIST TOOL
POD0000006325_S0000229 WE HAVE OTHER TOOLING THAT DOES MORE COMPLICATED BUILD PIPELINES AS WELL THAT'S KIND OF HOMEGROWN
POD0000006325_S0000244 THE CAR IS NOT AIR GAPPED HOWEVER
POD0000006325_S0000256 WHEN YOU'RE DEPLOYING THIS LARGE VOLUME OF SERVICES
POD0000006325_S0000274 WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO DO IN A KUBERNETES ENVIRONMENT BUT THANKFULLY
POD0000006325_S0000288 KUBERNETES CLUSTER MANAGEMENT A COUPLE THINGS I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO ONE HOW MANY KUBERNETES CLUSTERS DO WE WANT
POD0000006325_S0000294 THE PETS VERSUS CATTLE ANALOGY
POD0000006325_S0000314 BUT IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE DISCARDING THEM WHEN THEY FAIL THE SAME WAY YOU'RE DISCARDING PODS BECAUSE IT'S A SELF-HEALING SYSTEM IT'S HIGHLY AVAILABLE IT'S PRETTY LARGE AND COMPLEX
POD0000006325_S0000325 I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH THAT
POD0000006325_S0000337 AND A NAMESPACE AND A NODE
POD0000006325_S0000356 BUT IT USED TO BE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED
POD0000006325_S0000376 THEN IT DOESN'T REALLY KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE CLIENT TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND EVERY CLIENT IS THEN MAKING THE SAME DECISION AS OPPOSED TO MOVING INTO THE CLIENT SIDE WHERE YOU CAN HAVE A MORE DYNAMIC SYSTEM THAT IS BASED ON WHERE THE CLIENT IS AND WHERE THE SERVICE IS AND WHERE IT GOT A LOAD BALANCED TO
POD0000006325_S0000397 YEAH SORT OF I THINK BECAUSE OF THE POPULARITY OF KUBERNETES
POD0000006325_S0000424 AND JUST KEEP THE EXPERIENCES SMOOTH AS POSSIBLE
POD0000006325_S0000431 I THINK OBVIOUSLY WITH ANY SORT OF A HYPED TERM LIKE THAT
POD0000006325_S0000454 OR A SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE
POD0000006325_S0000463 I'M LOOKING AT MY CATS RIGHT NOW
POD0000006325_S0000468 AND X-TEAM WILL HELP YOU FIND WORK THAT YOU LOVE FOR SOME OF THE TOP COMPANIES IN THE WORLD
POD0000006333_S0000006 HOW SHOULD YOU LAUD AND MONITOR YOUR KUBERNETES CLUSTER AND WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT TO SET ALL THAT STUFF UP
POD0000006333_S0000015 OUTSYSTEMS IS A PLATFORM FOR BUILDING LOW CODE APPS
POD0000006333_S0000020 OUTSYSTEMS HAS EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED TO BUILD RELEASE AND UPDATE YOUR APPS WITHOUT NEEDING AN EXPERT ENGINEER
POD0000006333_S0000035 SUPER SUPER IMPORTANT
POD0000006333_S0000046 I PUSH IT TO MY GITHUB REPO AND MY KUBERNETES DEPLOYMENT SHOULD BE REACTING TO THAT PUSH THAT I HAVE MADE
POD0000006333_S0000066 HOW DOES TERRAFORM FIT INTO A KUBERNETES DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW
POD0000006333_S0000078 LET'S SWITCH THE TOPIC OF STATE MANAGEMENT
POD0000006333_S0000095 THEN FROM THERE DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT'S A STATEFUL APPLICATION OR NOT THEY MAY NEED TO BRING WITH THEM SOME TYPE STORAGE
POD0000006333_S0000108 ABSOLUTELY
POD0000006333_S0000125 MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE
POD0000006333_S0000141 EVAN TSCHUI
POD0000006333_S0000179 BEING EXPOSED TO SOME OF THE MORE BASIC LEVELS OF TAKING A STEP BACK AND DIGGING IN TO WHAT'S GOING ON
POD0000006333_S0000191 BECAUSE IT GIVES DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT TEAMS ON THOSE UPSTREAM KIND OF DISTRIBUTIONS THE ABILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE THEMSELVES
POD0000006333_S0000203 THERE WAS NOTES
POD0000006333_S0000237 THE PREMIUM EPISODES WILL BE RELEASED ROUGHLY ONCE A MONTH AND THEY'LL BE SIMILAR TO OUR RECENT EPISODE
POD0000006333_S0000243 SOFTWAREDAILY DOT COM IS OUR NEW PLATFORM THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BUILDING IN THE OPEN
POD0000006333_S0000254 I AGREE WITH IN MY HEART BUT I THINK THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT FLAWED
POD0000006333_S0000269 NOW
POD0000006333_S0000285 WELL
POD0000006333_S0000298 WHICH IS DEFINITELY A DIFFERENT MODEL THAN WHAT A LOT OF THE FOLKS AT CUBE-CON WERE DOING
POD0000006333_S0000320 AS KUBERNETES ALSO INCREASES IN POPULARITY IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOLKS TO KIND OF EVEN HAVE CROSS KUBERNETES INTERACTION OF APPLICATIONS
POD0000006333_S0000335 LISTEN BACK TO OUR OLD EPISODES WITH THE THOUGHTWORKS TEAM WHO HAVE BUILT THE PRODUCT
POD0000006341_S0000007 THE OVERHEAD OF THOSE DEPLOYMENTS IS BECOMING A RELEVANT CONCERN
POD0000006341_S0000026 THE PURISTS WOULD TELL YOU CONTAINERS HAVE EXISTED FOR LONGER THAN VIRTUAL MACHINES ON SOLARIS AND BSD AND STUFF LIKE THAT
POD0000006341_S0000045 WITH THE CONTAINERS LINUX CONTAINERS BY THEMSELVES DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF MULTIPLE USERS
POD0000006341_S0000058 THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS REACH ALL THE WAY DOWN
POD0000006341_S0000074 BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE THE STRATEGY ITSELF
POD0000006341_S0000087 YOU AS AN ENGINEER NEED TO BE AWARE OF THE BUSINESS PRIORITIES
POD0000006341_S0000103 AND THEN LATER ON REALIZE THAT ACTUALLY WE SHOULD HAVE SPUN UP A BUNCH OF SMALLER KUBERNETES CLUSTERS
POD0000006341_S0000122 TWENTY
POD0000006341_S0000140 JUNE TENTH THROUGH THIRTEENTH
POD0000006341_S0000147 GOING TO CONFERENCES CAN REALLY HELP AT THE VELOCITY PROGRAM IN SAN JOSE YOU CAN LEARN NEW SKILLS YOU CAN LEARN TECHNOLOGIES FOR BUILDING AND MANAGING LARGE-SCALE CLOUD NATIVE SYSTEMS YOU CAN CONNECT WITH PEERS TO SHARE INSIGHTS AND IDEAS
POD0000006341_S0000157 SOMETHING LIKE FOUR TO SIX VIRTUAL MACHINES AT LEAST
POD0000006341_S0000197 WITHOUT SAYING
POD0000006341_S0000212 WHEREAS ON AMAZON
POD0000006341_S0000238 YEAH THAT'S RIGHT OKAY
POD0000006341_S0000246 BUT THEY HAVE THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTAINERS
POD0000006341_S0000263 THEY RUN CONTAINERS DIRECTLY ON THE HOSTS RUNNING ON BORG
POD0000006341_S0000284 THEY DON'T NECESSARILY EXPECT THEIR CUSTOMERS TO DO THAT SAME THING ON THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE
POD0000006341_S0000293 START A FREE TRIAL TODAY AND DATADOG WILL SEND YOU A T-SHIRT
POD0000006341_S0000322 ADDING IN ALL THIS EXTRA STUFF YOU NEED TO LEARN AS ON TOP OF IT
POD0000006341_S0000336 AND SAID LOOK I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME I WANT A SERVICE MESH AND I WANT IT NOW
POD0000006341_S0000355 ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S QUITE HEAVY
POD0000006341_S0000385 AND THEN WE TURN IT INTO SOMETHING THAT'S ABLE TO BE CONSUMABLE IN A MARKETPLACE-TYPE SCENARIO SO THAT A USER OF THAT PLATFORM CAN SAY OH WE NEED THIS OTHER THING AS A MIDDLEWARE OR AS A DATABASE LAYER OR AS SOMETHING ELSE
POD0000006341_S0000403 SO YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE INVESTING IN A CONTINUOUS DELIVERY TOOL THAT IS BUILT FOR THE LONG-TERM
POD0000006349_S0000010 DOES THIS MAKE US COMPLICIT IN BUILDING WEAPONS
POD0000006349_S0000015 BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH IN A WAR
POD0000006349_S0000020 IN TODAY'S SHOW P W RETURNS TO TALK ABOUT HIS BOOK LIKEWAR THE WEAPONIZATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA TO FIND ALL NINE HUNDRED OF OUR OLD EPISODES
POD0000006349_S0000025 BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY YOU CAN JUST INTERACT WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY COMMUNITY YOU CAN FIND EPISODES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY APPEALING TO YOU
POD0000006349_S0000034 TRIPLEBYTE WILL EVEN COVER THE COST OF YOUR FLIGHTS AND HOTELS FOR FINAL INTERVIEWS AT THE HIRING COMPANIES THAT'S PRETTY SWEET TRIPLEBYTE HELPS ENGINEERS IDENTIFY HIGH-GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES
POD0000006349_S0000042 DRONES STUXNET AND SOME ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA MANIPULATION
POD0000006349_S0000061 OR THE PHILIPPINES
POD0000006349_S0000093 NEW TRUTHS
POD0000006349_S0000118 APP ACADEMY TEACHES YOU RUBY ON RAILS JAVASCRIPT AND REACT AND YOU DON'T NEED ANY PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE TO GET STARTED WITH A CODING BOOT CAMP LIKE APP ACADEMY APP ACADEMY DOESN'T CHARGE TUITION UNTIL A STUDENT IS HIRED AND EARNING MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN COMPENSATION
POD0000006349_S0000125 BUT THAT'S ALSO HOW THEY ARE ABLE TO PACK SO MUCH INFORMATION INTO THREE MONTHS IT'S GRUELING
POD0000006349_S0000135 YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO CLICK ON MORE LIKELY TO SHARE STORIES THAT REINFORCE YOUR WORLDVIEW
POD0000006349_S0000183 IT'S THE BATTLE TO BE REAL BUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS A BATTLE TO BE REAL
POD0000006349_S0000209 BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU TAKE THAT NEUTRAL POSITION
POD0000006349_S0000233 NO THEY'VE JUST MOVED ON TO OTHER NEW TACTICS
POD0000006349_S0000244 OR CICD WORKLOADS
POD0000006349_S0000275 THAT THERE ARE ACTORS ON THEIR NETWORKS WHO ARE TRYING TO BOTH MANIPULATE THEIR NETWORKS AND TARGET THEIR USERS WITH HARM
POD0000006349_S0000290 WE DECIDE WHETHER THESE VERY SAME ACTORS THRIVE OR NOT THIS SAME ACTOR IS OUT THERE CONTINUING TO PUSH ALL SORTS OF OTHER COCKAMAMIE IDEAS
POD0000006349_S0000305 WHAT THE COMPANIES WE'VE SEEN THEM GO FROM SAYING
POD0000006349_S0000321 HOW DIFFERENT ARE WE FROM THE CHINESE AND HOW DOES THE SOCIAL MEDIA LIKEWAR MANIFEST IN CHINA
POD0000006349_S0000338 WHICH BASICALLY IT'S A THE IDEA ULTIMATELY WHEN IT'S PUT INTO PLACE IS THAT PEOPLE WILL GET A SINGLE NUMERIC SCORE OF THEIR TRUSTWORTHINESS IN THE IDEA OF IN THE MIND OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THIS CORPORATE MAKEUP
POD0000006349_S0000348 YOU WILL NOT BE MATCHED WITH SOMEONE WHO IS ATTRACTIVE
POD0000006349_S0000360 YOU CAN MOVE YOUR WORKLOADS EASILY BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE
POD0000006349_S0000365 YOU CAN FOCUS ON YOUR APPLICATION INSTEAD OF COMPLEX KUBERNETES ISSUES OPENSHIFT IS OPEN SOURCE TECHNOLOGY BUILT TO ENABLE EVERYONE TO LAUNCH THEIR BIG IDEAS
POD0000006357_S0000006 SHUAH HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO K SELF-TEST
POD0000006357_S0000011 THERE'S SMOKE TESTING PERFORMANCE TESTING AND REGRESSION TESTING
POD0000006357_S0000020 HE'S REALLY A GREAT GUY AND INTERESTING TO TALK TO
POD0000006357_S0000026 WE'RE HAVING AN IN-PERSON HACKATHON AT APP ACADEMY AND WE'RE GOING TO HANG OUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME FOOD
POD0000006357_S0000033 AND I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE FOCUS ON USER EXPERIENCE THE GREAT DOCUMENTATION AND THE SIMPLE USER INTERFACE
POD0000006357_S0000042 THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO EXPERIMENT WITH
POD0000006357_S0000049 SHUAH KHAN YOU ARE A LINUX CORE COMMITTER WELCOME TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY THANK YOU
POD0000006357_S0000059 YOU'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THE TESTING PROCESS FOR THE LINUX KERNEL
POD0000006357_S0000072 BROWSERS AND SO ON
POD0000006357_S0000090 BOOT THE KERNEL AND RUN THIS TEST
POD0000006357_S0000108 SO DOES THAT HELP YOU UNDERSTAND IT DOES YES YEAH YOU MENTIONED THIS TOOL
POD0000006357_S0000124 AS A USER
POD0000006357_S0000140 THAT'S THE REGRESSION PART OF IT
POD0000006357_S0000148 LINUX IS ALSO VERY COMPLICATED
POD0000006357_S0000163 YOU WANT TO HAVE THOSE BITS
POD0000006357_S0000178 SO YOU SAY HEY I WANT TO TAKE THIS DEVICE AND ASSIGN IT TO THE VM
POD0000006357_S0000195 IS THERE SOME JUDGMENT THAT'S INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS
POD0000006357_S0000216 DOCKER AND MORE THAN THIRTY OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT TOOLS
POD0000006357_S0000228 YOU MIGHT SAY
POD0000006357_S0000241 FUNCTIONAL TYPE TESTING LIKE LOCK IMBALANCE IT WILL ULTIMATELY SHOW UP IN A BLACK BOX USER TEST CASE
POD0000006357_S0000256 AND IT TOOK ME SOME TIME TO COME UP WITH IT
POD0000006357_S0000273 SO I WAS LOOKING AT THAT PATCH SERIES AND I'M GOING HOW DO I TEST ALL OF THE EXCLUSION CASES
POD0000006357_S0000281 LOOK AT THE MANUAL TESTING
POD0000006357_S0000316 INVOKE ALL OF THE SYSTEMS CALLS AND PASS THEM
POD0000006357_S0000344 BUT YEAH
POD0000006357_S0000374 IT SHOULD WORK
POD0000006357_S0000393 THIRTY TWO WAY SIXTEEN WAY SERVERS EVEN EIGHT WAY
POD0000006357_S0000425 SO WE WANT AT THE SAME TIME YOU ALSO WANT TO KEEP YOUR PRODUCT STABLE
POD0000006357_S0000457 UBUNTU

POD0000006365_S0000003 AN ECONOMIST STUDIES THE PRICING DATA TO ENSURE THAT LYFT'S PRICES ARE COMPETITIVE
POD0000006365_S0000009 TAO FENG AND MARK GROVER ARE ENGINEERS AT LYFT AND THEY JOIN THE SHOW TO TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF DATA DISCOVERY AND THE TOOLS THEY HAVE BUILT AND OPEN SOURCED AT LYFT A FEW UPDATES FROM SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY LAND
POD0000006365_S0000016 AND WE'LL BE ANNOUNCING OUR NEXT HACKATHON IN A FEW WEEKS SO PLEASE STAY TUNED
POD0000006365_S0000021 ONCE YOU HAVE BEEN VETTED AND ACCEPTED TO VETTERY
POD0000006365_S0000027 VETTERY IS COMPLETELY FREE FOR JOBSEEKERS
POD0000006365_S0000036 LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT HOW DATA SCIENCE WORKS AT LYFT
POD0000006365_S0000054 THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT THIS EXPLOSION OF ROLES THAT ARE RELATED TO DATA YOU'VE GOT NOT ONLY DATA SCIENTIST AND DATA ENGINEER BUT YOU'VE GOT THE DATA ANALYSTS YOU'VE GOT THE MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER
POD0000006365_S0000062 AS WELL AS MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEERS
POD0000006365_S0000069 IF I'M BUILDING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
POD0000006365_S0000095 HOW IS DATA STORED WITHIN LYFT SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE
POD0000006365_S0000113 SO IF I'M A DATA SCIENTIST AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO EASILY FIND DATASETS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO WHATEVER I'M STUDYING OR WHATEVER MACHINE LEARNING MODEL I'M BUILDING
POD0000006365_S0000130 REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CALL THE SHAPE OF THE DATA AND IT HELPS THEM GAIN THAT TRUST
POD0000006365_S0000141 FLATIRON SCHOOL CAN TEACH YOU THE SKILLS YOU NEED TO BUILD A CAREER THAT YOU WILL LOVE
POD0000006365_S0000148 FLATIRON SCHOOL ALSO HELPS THE STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE FIND A JOB
POD0000006365_S0000162 IN ADDITION TO THAT WE NEEDED SOME TACTICAL SUPPORT AROUND REDSHIFT TABLES AS WELL AS HIGH TABLES
POD0000006365_S0000174 GDPR PURPOSES
POD0000006365_S0000202 THEN YOU GO AND ANALYZE AND EXPLORE AND THEN YOU DASHBOARD AND SHARE
POD0000006365_S0000224 WHILE PUSH-BASED APPROACH IS LIKE WHENEVER THE SOURCE HAS A CHANGE
POD0000006365_S0000246 NETLIFY IS A MODERN WAY TO BUILD AND MANAGE FAST MODERN WEBSITES THAT RUN WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ADDRESSABLE WEB SERVERS
POD0000006365_S0000251 WHENEVER YOU PUSH TO YOUR GIT REPOSITORY
POD0000006365_S0000257 AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THERE'S AUTOMATIC FORMS IDENTITY MANAGEMENT AND TOOLS TO MANAGE AND TRANSFORM LARGE IMAGES AND MEDIA
POD0000006365_S0000276 THEY DO HAVE CHOICE SUPPORT BUT
POD0000006365_S0000295 AND THAT'S GOING TO HIT ELASTICSEARCH
POD0000006365_S0000331 AND THEN CLICK THE RESULT
POD0000006365_S0000363 YOU WERE BOTH AT STRATA I WAS AT STRATA
POD0000006365_S0000384 WHAT ABOUT SECURITY AND HOSTING AND MAINTENANCE
POD0000006365_S0000389 THEN YOU CAN DO MUCH MORE
POD0000006373_S0000006 SECOND SPECTRUM IS A COMPANY THAT ANALYZES DATA FROM PROFESSIONAL SPORTS
POD0000006373_S0000016 TELESIGN HAS BEAUTIFUL OFFICES IN LOS ANGELES
POD0000006373_S0000030 YOU GIVE IT SOME PROJECT AND I'LL POP SOME ANSWER
POD0000006373_S0000040 FUTURE ENGINEERING IS ONE OF THE KEYS TO ALL OF MACHINE LEARNING JUST THINKING THAT YOU CAN THROW ALL YOUR DATA INTO A BUCKET AND SOMETHING MAGIC COMES OUT
POD0000006373_S0000053 YOUR DATA IS ON ONE DIMENSION HERE YOUR X-AXIS
POD0000006373_S0000066 TEXT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY WAS EVERY SINGLE WORD IN THE DOCUMENT AND ITS FREQUENCY WAS A FEATURE
POD0000006373_S0000079 GIVE UP ON THAT
POD0000006373_S0000093 IF YOU GIVE IT OBJECTS THAT YOU'VE HASHED AND THEN SAY HEY HAVE I SEEN THIS OBJECT BEFORE
POD0000006373_S0000112 IS WITHOUT TOO MUCH EFFORT
POD0000006373_S0000121 YOU HAVE NO IDEA BUT STEAM REALLY KNOWS ALREADY IF THEY WANT TO STUDY IT
POD0000006373_S0000136 WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S ANONYMOUS AND ALL THAT
POD0000006373_S0000146 SO THEN HALF MY GROUP IN AN AB TEST
POD0000006373_S0000156 YOU CAN SUBMIT TO ME EXAMPLES
POD0000006373_S0000169 AND ALSO YOU AS INDIVIDUALS YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT YOUR DATA THAT WAS IN THE TRAINING SET TO BE INCLUDED IN THE SAME WAY I MIGHT GIVE MY DATA TO THAT MEDICAL RESEARCH BUT I DON'T WANT IT BEING PASSED ALONG ANYWHERE ELSE THE OWNER OF THAT DATA CAN LEAK IT CAN GET HACKED CAN GET ACQUIRED WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE
POD0000006373_S0000179 THAT I WOULD PASS YOU THIS ENCRYPTED DATA
POD0000006373_S0000198 IMMUTABILITY IS SOMETHING MACHINE LEARNING DOESN'T NECESSARILY BENEFIT FROM
POD0000006373_S0000235 NOW IN THE SAME WAY I TOLD YOU EARLIER A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL CAN BE STOLEN FROM THE CLOUD
POD0000006373_S0000249 DIFFERENT CONTEXT DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE APPROPRIATE
POD0000006373_S0000263 YOU'RE ALSO GETTING TO KNOW THE DATA AT THE SAME TIME AND YOU'RE GENERATING THE INSIGHTS REQUIRED TO BUILD A GOOD MODEL
POD0000006373_S0000271 THOSE WILL HURT MODEL TRAINING AND TODAY MODEL TRAINING CAN BE A VERY SLOW PROCESS MACHINE LEARNING PEOPLE DON'T WANT SLOWER PROCESS
POD0000006373_S0000301 INFORMATION IS WEIRD AND IT GETS EMBEDDED IN THINGS IN UNEXPECTED WAYS
POD0000006373_S0000329 A FEW PEOPLE
POD0000006373_S0000344 AT ANY RATE
POD0000006373_S0000357 THERE WE GO
POD0000006373_S0000375 IN OUR CASE
POD0000006373_S0000436 WE TAKE AND ENCODE THE VIDEO
POD0000006373_S0000459 AND WE ALSO USE TENSORFLOW WHICH IS AGAIN A VERY COMMON MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORK
POD0000006373_S0000490 OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE ON THE PODCAST YOU CAN'T SEE THIS BUT
POD0000006373_S0000534 SO I'LL HAVE TO DECODE SOME OF THESE ALGORITHMS THESE NAMES PERHAPS
POD0000006373_S0000550 WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN FIND THOSE
POD0000006373_S0000561 COLLECT MORE DATA
POD0000006373_S0000592 NOW
POD0000006373_S0000607 ANY QUESTIONS
POD0000006373_S0000648 WE KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A BASKETBALL COURT WE CAN USE THAT
POD0000006381_S0000011 AND IF YOU WANT TO FIND ALL THESE EPISODES YOU CAN ALWAYS DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY APPS FOR IOS OR ANDROID
POD0000006381_S0000021 MESOSPHERE'S KUBERNETES-AS-A-SERVICE HEALS ITSELF WHEN IT DETECTS A PROBLEM WITH THE STATE OF THE CLUSTER
POD0000006381_S0000029 ONE REASON I AM A BIG FAN OF MESOSPHERE IS THAT ONE OF THE FOUNDERS BEN HINDMAN IS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE I INTERVIEWED ABOUT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING BACK WHEN I WAS A HOST ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING RADIO
POD0000006381_S0000058 THE ORIGINAL BINARY WAS NAMED PLATFORM
POD0000006381_S0000076 BUT THEN THEY ALSO HAVE THIS PLUG-IN MARKETPLACE
POD0000006381_S0000120 MAKING SURE WE CAN SUPPORT THAT FOR LARGE ENTERPRISES
POD0000006381_S0000160 HOW MUCH DO THESE DEPLOYMENTS VARY FROM CUSTOMER TO CUSTOMER
POD0000006381_S0000180 HOW DO YOU MANAGE CREDENTIALS WITHIN YOUR TEAMS OR YOUR PRODUCTS
POD0000006381_S0000187 WHICH I THINK CAN BE REALLY PRODUCTIVE FOR ALLOWING YOU TO BUILD AND LEVERAGE YOUR CREATIVITY FASTER
POD0000006381_S0000194 OR PROJECT
POD0000006381_S0000215 WAS A LOAD TESTING FRAMEWORK AN OPEN SOURCE LOAD TESTING FRAMEWORK

POD0000006397_S0000012 GREMLIN PROVIDES RESILIENCE AS A SERVICE USING CHAOS ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES PIONEERED AT NETFLIX AND AMAZON
POD0000006397_S0000018 ILAN RABINOVITCH WELCOME TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY THANKS FOR HAVING ME
POD0000006397_S0000042 WAS JUST THAT EVERY INDUSTRY SEEMS TO GROW AND SHRINK
POD0000006397_S0000082 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO OBSERVE AND MONITOR KUBERNETES
POD0000006397_S0000103 THAT'S SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH DATADOG THANK YOU DATADOG
POD0000006397_S0000130 WHAT ARE THE OTHER METRICS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BE LOOKING AT ACROSS YOUR CLUSTER

POD0000006405_S0000058 THEY WERE DOING DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS AND PARALLEL COMPUTING AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS ARE VERY VERY SIMILAR
POD0000006405_S0000102 IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY HARD FOR THOSE THINGS TO ACTUALLY GET PICKED UP IN ANY KIND OF INDUSTRIAL SETTING
POD0000006405_S0000110 IBM DEVELOPER IS A HUB FOR OPEN SOURCE CODE DESIGN PATTERNS ARTICLES AND TUTORIALS ABOUT HOW TO BUILD MODERN APPLICATIONS
POD0000006405_S0000115 GET HELP WITH SIDE PROJECTS

POD0000006429_S0000318 OR A NETWORK CONNECTION
POD0000006429_S0000341 ONE THING THAT'S USEFUL FOR ME IS I CAN LOOK THROUGH ALL THESE DIFFERENT SERVICES I CAN GET IDEAS
POD0000006429_S0000355 WE'VE GOT INFORMATION THERE ACROSS THE DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEM VENDORS THE DIFFERENT CONTAINER PEOPLE
POD0000006429_S0000375 SOME THINGS THAT ARE CHANGING RECENTLY ARE THERE'S JUST SOME HIGHER LEVEL MANAGED SERVICES PEOPLE WANT SOME PEOPLE LIKE FUNCTIONS AS A SERVICE
POD0000006429_S0000396 IT SOUNDS COMPLETELY NORMAL TODAY
POD0000006437_S0000006 A DEDICATED PHYSICAL DEVICE SITS IN THE COMPUTER NETWORK TO DO THIS ROUTING

POD0000006437_S0000051 OH SO NETWORK VIRTUALIZATION IS THE EQUIVALENT OF HYPERVISOR FOR YOUR NETWORK
POD0000006437_S0000072 BUT ONCE YOU THROW VLANS INTO THE PICTURE THE LINUX BRIDGE STARTS GETTING A LITTLE AWKWARD
POD0000006437_S0000082 THEN YOU WANT MORE CONTROL OVER THEM YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ADMINISTERING THOSE HYPERVISORS AND THEIR NETWORKS INDIVIDUALLY
POD0000006437_S0000090 DISTRIBUTED VIRTUAL SWITCH SURE
POD0000006437_S0000109 YOU TAKE THESE PACKETS GOING BETWEEN THE VIRTUAL MACHINES AND YOU ENCAPSULATE THEM ON THE SENDER AND THEN YOU DECAPSULATE THEM ON RECEIVER
POD0000006437_S0000117 LET'S SAY THAT THEY SHOULD BE PART OF ONE OF THE EXISTING TENANTS
POD0000006437_S0000132 IT'S GOING TO COME OUT INTO OPEN VSWITCH
POD0000006437_S0000146 OR CICD WORKLOADS
POD0000006437_S0000163 WELL A LOT OF IT WAS SIMPLY THAT THEY HAD A LOT OF NETWORK DEVICES THEY HAD A LOT OF SWITCHES AND ROUTERS AND F IREWALLS AND OTHER THINGS AND THEY HAD TO BE CONF IGURED INDIVIDUALLY
POD0000006437_S0000193 WHEN OPEN VSWITCH IS RUNNING ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT PHYSICAL SERVERS
POD0000006437_S0000206 HOW DOES A SYSTEM LIKE OPENSTACK INTERACT WITH OPEN VSWITCH TALK ABOUT THAT IN MORE DETAIL
POD0000006437_S0000232 I DON'T KNOW IF CORRECTITUDE IS A WORD
POD0000006437_S0000241 OR SENT IN YOU MIGHT WANT TO FOR EXAMPLE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE USER OR THE VM OR THE PROCESS THAT SENT THE PACKET

POD0000006437_S0000263 IT MIGHT TURN OUT THAT OPEN VSWITCH ISN'T THE RIGHT PLACE
POD0000006437_S0000277 I THINK THAT THERE ARE REALLY TWO BIG CATEGORIES OF CHALLENGES

POD0000006477_S0000207 IT HELPS TREMENDOUSLY TO ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE PROTEIN LOOKS LIKE CAN YOU JUST WALK ME THROUGH WHAT AN EXAMPLE PROTEIN PREDICTION PROCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE
POD0000006477_S0000227 CAN YOU
POD0000006477_S0000259 OKAY
POD0000006477_S0000284 FOURTEEN YEARS
POD0000006477_S0000332 TYPICALLY THERE'S PROBABLY ON THE ORDER OF ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PROTEINS THAT REALLY HAVE TO WORK WITH IN TERMS OF STRUCTURES
POD0000006477_S0000359 WHETHER YOU ARE A NEW COMPANY BUILDING YOUR FIRST PRODUCT
POD0000006477_S0000364 WE'VE ALSO DONE SEVERAL SHOWS WITH THE PEOPLE WHO RUN G TWO I
POD0000006477_S0000369 AND THE G TWO I STAFF ARE FRIENDLY AND EASY TO WORK WITH
POD0000006477_S0000382 WHERE DEEP LEARNING HELPS IS TO BASICALLY REFINE THESE PREDICTION
POD0000006477_S0000398 THEY LATER INNOVATED UPON THAT WITH ALPHA ZERO
POD0000006477_S0000430 HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT
POD0000006477_S0000459 SAY
POD0000006477_S0000489 BUILD YOUR WEBSITE QUICKLY WITH WIX
POD0000006477_S0000497 THERE'S PLENTY THAT YOU CAN DO WITHOUT WRITING A LOT OF CODE
POD0000006485_S0000004 THE EMAIL ADDRESS MIGHT RESEMBLE SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW OR A TRANSACTIONAL EMAIL FROM A COMPANY LIKE UBER OR AMAZON
POD0000006485_S0000010 PLEASE FILL OUT THE LISTENERS' SURVEY AVAILABLE ON SOFTWAREENGINEERINGDAILY DOT COM SLASH SURVEY
POD0000006485_S0000019 IN ORDER TO GET US TO THAT BRIGHT FUTURE WE NEED NEW KINDS OF HARDWARE AND NEW INTERFACES BETWEEN THIS AI HARDWARE AND THE HIGHER LEVEL SOFTWARE
POD0000006485_S0000026 COME BUILD THE FUTURE OF AI AND DEEP LEARNING AT INTEL NERVANA
POD0000006485_S0000036 YOU ARE BOTH HEAVILY ENGAGED IN THIS SPACE AND I WANT TO START WITH A STORY FROM EACH OF YOU ABOUT RANSOMWARE IT CAN EITHER BE A BRIEF NEWS STORY THAT ILLUSTRATES A TYPE OF RANSOMWARE
POD0000006485_S0000052 BUT FOR HER MEDICAL RECORDS AND SO ON AND WHAT THAT WAS GOING TO MEAN TO HER
POD0000006485_S0000069 BUT YOU SEE SPORA YOU SEE LOCKY NOT AS MUCH BUT THAT RECENTLY WAS A BIG ONE
POD0000006485_S0000075 DESTRUCTION
POD0000006485_S0000091 ALLAN WHY DON'T YOU DESCRIBE SOME OF THESE
POD0000006485_S0000115 USE FRESHBOOKS CLOUD ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE
POD0000006485_S0000122 AND ACTION ITEMS AT A GLANCE
POD0000006485_S0000132 THE NEXT PHASE OF RANSONWARE IS THE INSTALLATION EVENT
POD0000006485_S0000149 ALLAN EXPLAINS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE COMMAND AND CONTROL TRANSACTION
POD0000006485_S0000160 SO THAT THE RANSONWARE DEVELOPERS CAN KEEP TRACK OF THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE BEING INFECTED
POD0000006485_S0000169 THERE'S THE OTHER PART OF THAT WHERE RANSONWARE DOESN'T ALWAYS OPERATE ALONE
POD0000006485_S0000192 IN YOUR BOOK YOU TALK ABOUT THE FACTORS THAT A VICTIM SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO PAY THE RANSOM
POD0000006485_S0000215 ONE OF THE REALLY FASCINATING THINGS WE FOUND OUT IN DOING THE RESEARCH FOR OUR BOOK WAS THAT
POD0000006485_S0000230 BUT IT'S NOT A LOT
POD0000006485_S0000244 ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING RANSONWARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPLOYING IT
POD0000006485_S0000278 SO EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGH PROFILE ARRESTS AND BUSTS AND SO ON
POD0000006485_S0000296 SO YOU HAVE A MICROSOFT WORD ATTACHMENT
POD0000006485_S0000304 THE PEOPLE BEHIND LOCKY PULLED IN MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR
POD0000006485_S0000324 KEYRANGER WAS PROBABLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MAC RANSOM WARE
POD0000006485_S0000354 PROBABLY ISN'T AS HIGH VOLUMETRICALLY SPEAKING FROM A MONETARY PERSPECTIVE
POD0000006485_S0000363 MY INTERNET MAY STOP WORKING
POD0000006485_S0000375 LET'S CLOSE OFF JUST DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR WORK IS
POD0000006485_S0000386 SEPARATELY FROM THAT TIM AND I TALK SEVERAL TIMES A MONTH JUST I DON'T WANT TO SAY MENTOR BECAUSE WE'VE BOTH BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
POD0000006493_S0000003 IN CONTRAST TO A MODEL WHERE COMPLETELY SEPARATE TEAMS HAVE TO RECREATE FRONT-END LOGIC FOR IOS AND ANDROID REACT NATIVE WAS CREATED AT FACEBOOK
POD0000006493_S0000015 IF YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT COMMUNICATOR
POD0000006493_S0000023 AND DOIT INTERNATIONAL IS OFFERING IT TO OUR LISTENERS FOR FREE
POD0000006493_S0000029 THEY ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN CUSTOM SOFTWARE THAT THEY'VE WRITTEN WHICH IS A COMPLETE COST OPTIMIZATION PLATFORM FOR GOOGLE CLOUD
POD0000006493_S0000046 RUN ANYWHERE
POD0000006493_S0000056 IT'S NOT A FORK OF REACT IT'S NOT A CLONE OF REACT
POD0000006493_S0000077 A LOT OF LONG HOURS
POD0000006493_S0000093 AS OURS WAS AND STILL IS
POD0000006493_S0000116 AND THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THAT
POD0000006493_S0000130 MOST OF THE TIME YOU'RE LIVING IN JAVASCRIPT IN REACT LAND
POD0000006493_S0000142 THE VETTERY MATCHING ALGORITHM SHOWS OFF YOUR PROFILE TO HIRING MANAGERS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WITH YOUR SKILLS YOUR EXPERIENCE AND YOUR PREFERENCES
POD0000006493_S0000160 THERE'S THE REACT NATIVE STUFF IN JAVASCRIPT
POD0000006493_S0000203 BUT ALSO PART OF THE REASON WHY LELAND AND I WORKED FULL-TIME ON REACT NATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE WAS THAT WE PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SUPPORT
POD0000006493_S0000229 WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING SOME MATERIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH
POD0000006493_S0000273 AND SO WE HAD TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL CRASH END LINK TO MAKE SURE WE CAUGHT THE ACTUAL CRASH
POD0000006493_S0000288 IT OFFERS WONDERFUL FEATURES LIKE ONE-CLICK BUG REPORTING WHILE THE TESTER IS RUNNING THE TESTS
POD0000006493_S0000302 ASK YOU TO SAVE SOME STATE IN A PARSE LEVEL BUNDLE AND THEN ACTUALLY RESTORE YOUR APP IN A NEW PROCESS
POD0000006493_S0000309 THERE'S SIMPLY NO WAY TO RELIABLY PERSIST THAT IN THIS PARSE LEVEL BUNDLE
POD0000006493_S0000335 BUT ALSO DOING THINGS LIKE ADOPTING KOTLIN
POD0000006493_S0000354 EVEN IN PARTICULAR THE PIXEL WAS PARTICULARLY NOTABLE FOR THIS
POD0000006493_S0000361 IT WAS HITTING THE JAVASCRIPT
POD0000006493_S0000391 IN FACT OVER THE TWO YEARS THAT NUMBER GREW TO ABOUT FIFTY
POD0000006493_S0000410 ODDLY ENOUGH I FEEL LIKE
POD0000006493_S0000445 DATADOG PROVIDES DASHBOARDING ALERTING APPLICATION PERFORMANCE MONITORING AND LOG MANAGEMENT IN ONE TIGHTLY INTEGRATED PLATFORM
POD0000006501_S0000011 WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING APPLICATION HEALTH AND BEST PRACTICES FOR MONITORING APPLICATION USER EXPERIENCE
POD0000006501_S0000017 AND AT THE SAME TIME MOBILE APPS OFTEN DON'T MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS
POD0000006501_S0000047 WHAT ARE THE BACK-END CHALLENGES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO A MOBILE APPLICATION
POD0000006501_S0000069 I CAN'T EVEN GET THE ADDRESS OF MY HOTEL
POD0000006501_S0000100 BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT
POD0000006501_S0000120 THESE APPLICATIONS OFTEN REQUIRE DATA WAREHOUSING GLUE CODE
POD0000006501_S0000129 UNLESS YOU WANT TO OF COURSE
POD0000006501_S0000135 THANKS TO EXAPTIVE FOR BEING A NEW SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
POD0000006501_S0000180 LET'S GO INTO THE TECHNICAL DEPTHS OF THE REALM MOBILE DATABASE AND THEN WE WILL ZOOM OUT AND TALK ABOUT THE FRAMEWORK AND THE HIGHER LEVEL THINGS THAT YOU'RE SOLVING
POD0000006501_S0000193 BASICALLY STORES
POD0000006501_S0000227 SURE
POD0000006501_S0000256 IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE THAT INTEGRATION REALLY SMOOTH
POD0000006501_S0000298 AND GOOGLE CAN'T DO IT
POD0000006501_S0000337 FLAPPY NETWORKS
POD0000006501_S0000391 AND THEN YOU CAN JUST CONCENTRATE ON
POD0000006501_S0000480 THAT IS REALLY REALLY CRUCIAL FOR YOUR BUSINESS
POD0000006509_S0000006 BUT THERE ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDES TO OFFICES
POD0000006509_S0000011 REMOTE WORK HAS BECOME AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR MODE OF WORK FOR KNOWLEDGE WORKERS
POD0000006509_S0000018 PHILIP THOMAS IS THE COFOUNDER AND CEO OF MOONLIGHT WORK
POD0000006509_S0000026 I THINK IT'S A COOL WAY OF HIRING PEOPLE I THINK IT'S A COOL WAY FOR ENGINEERS TO WORK
POD0000006509_S0000033 WHEN YOU'RE OUT TO DINNER AND YOUR PHONE BUZZES BECAUSE YOUR ENTIRE APPLICATION IS DOWN
POD0000006509_S0000040 AND THESE TOOLS INCLUDE A COMFORTABLE T-SHIRT
POD0000006509_S0000051 WILL THAT MODEL OF WORK EXIST IN TEN YEARS
POD0000006509_S0000059 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO INTO OFFICES OR NECESSARILY LIKE WORK JUST FROM CO-WORKING
POD0000006509_S0000066 IS THAT STILL A NECESSARY MODALITY OR CAN YOU GET EVERYTHING OUT OF ZOOM RECORDINGS AND WHATEVER SLACK
POD0000006509_S0000083 BUT I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE GET GRATIFICATION OUT OF IT
POD0000006509_S0000091 BUT AS A REMOTE TEAM YOU REALLY HAVE TO MAKE TIME AND FOCUS ON CREATING SOCIAL INTERACTION BETWEEN TEAMMATES
POD0000006509_S0000106 I MEAN YOU HAVE THESE PHONE BOOTHS
POD0000006509_S0000125 BECAUSE KNOWLEDGE WORKERS REALLY NEED FOCUSED TIME THAT'S UNINTERRUPTED TO GET DEEP WORK DONE
POD0000006509_S0000131 AND IT'S FUN FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT AFTER A WHILE YOU REALIZE YOU JUST NEED A PLACE WITH STABLE INTERNET WHERE YOU CAN DO A VIDEO CALL AND KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET LIKE ANGRY LOOKS OR SOMETHING
POD0000006509_S0000148 BUT WE SEE PEOPLE SWITCHING BETWEEN USING CO-WORKING AND NOT USING CO-WORKING AND THAT'S KIND OF THE FUN OF IT IS YOU CAN SWITCH UP YOUR ROUTINE
POD0000006509_S0000157 BECAUSE IT MADE US BE EVEN MORE REMOTE AND REMOTE FRIENDLY BECAUSE WE NOW ONLY JOIN VIDEO CALLS EVEN IF WERE IN THE SAME ROOM ON SEPARATE COMPUTERS
POD0000006509_S0000165 WHERE SOMEONE CAN BE WORKING AND HAVE NO TIME ZONE OVERLAP WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM
POD0000006509_S0000179 IT'S MORE ABOUT WHAT'S YOUR TECHNOLOGY STACK
POD0000006509_S0000196 BECAUSE EMAIL IS THE HISTORICAL DEFAULT ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION TOOL
POD0000006509_S0000206 YOU SEE SOME HISTORICAL EXAMPLES LIKE EXPENSIFY USED TO FLY EVERYBODY TO A DIFFERENT COUNTRY FOR A MONTH
POD0000006509_S0000216 WE BROUGHT THE WHOLE TEAM TO SAN FRANCISCO AND WE TRIED TO NOT FOCUS TOO MUCH ON GETTING WORK DONE
POD0000006509_S0000227 AND WHEN YOU'RE ENGAGING WITH PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATION SOFTWARE
POD0000006509_S0000247 SO WE TALK A LOT INTERNALLY ABOUT THE IDEA OF LIKE A MASLOW'S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS FOR REMOTE WORKERS
POD0000006509_S0000257 YOU HAVE EXPOSURE TO INTERESTING TECH TALKS YOU HAVE EXPOSURE TO MEET UPS THAT MIGHT BE HELD AT THE OFFICE
POD0000006509_S0000266 BECAUSE THAT CROSS-POLLINATION OF KNOWLEDGE IS REALLY WHAT MAKES EVERY COMPANY STRONGER
POD0000006509_S0000276 YOU HAVE TO HAVE MORE OF A QUEUE-BASED WORK STYLE
POD0000006509_S0000284 MAYBE THEY'RE WORKING ON THEIR STARTUP AND THEY'VE GOT FIFTEEN SPARE HOURS PER WEEK AND THAT'S HOW THEY PAY THE BILLS TO CONTINUE TO DO THEIR STARTUP
POD0000006509_S0000290 ITS CONTRACT WORK IS THE TYPE OF REMOTE WORK THAT EVERY COMPANY USES
POD0000006509_S0000300 SOME PEOPLE ARE
POD0000006509_S0000308 I THINK BITCOIN WAS REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE WHERE THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO WORK IN BITCOIN
POD0000006509_S0000316 WE SEE THE OPPOSITE END OF IT WHICH IS PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY GOOD AT LEGACY TECHNOLOGIES
POD0000006509_S0000328 BUT ANOTHER KIND OF STABILITY IS NOT CONTEXT SWITCHING A LOT THAT YOU CAN GET REALLY DEEP ON PROBLEMS
POD0000006509_S0000339 WHICH IS WHY WE THINK THE MARKET IS MOVING MORE TOWARDS FULL-TIME REMOTE EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE YOU GET THAT STABILITY AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONTEXT SWITCH
POD0000006509_S0000354 I'M PROBABLY GOING TO HIRE THEM FOR FORTY HOURS A WEEK FOR THREE TO FOUR WEEKS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS AND THEY CAN GO WORK ON SOMETHING NEW THEY CAN GO WORK ON THEIR OWN THING
POD0000006509_S0000363 AFTER A THIRTY MINUTE CONVERSATION
POD0000006509_S0000381 YOU CAN ALSO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT THE MARKET IS LIKE YOU CAN TEST DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THROUGH SOME DIFFERENT EXPERTS
POD0000006509_S0000392 JOHN DEERE IS BUILDING SELF DRIVING TRACTORS
POD0000006509_S0000406 JASPERSOFT OFFERS EMBEDDABLE REPORTS
POD0000006509_S0000413 BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST YOUR COMPANY THAT WANTS ANALYTICS
POD0000006509_S0000427 WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH WORKER WAGES
POD0000006509_S0000434 USERS SPECIFICALLY
POD0000006509_S0000451 HISTORICALLY
POD0000006509_S0000460 THEN YOU HAVE MANY MORE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES BEING STARTED
POD0000006509_S0000478 BECAUSE WE TALKED THIS WHOLE EPISODE ABOUT THE LONELINESS PROBLEMS FOR REMOTE WORKERS
POD0000006509_S0000485 I THINK ALL THIS IS STARTING TO CIRCULATE AROUND MORE OF DEMOCRATIZATION OF ACCESS TO COMMUNITY AND KNOWLEDGE AND EDUCATION TOOLS
POD0000006509_S0000492 OR ONLINE VIDEOS OR REALLY GREAT PODCASTS
POD0000006509_S0000498 IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPONSOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY SEND US AN EMAIL
POD0000006509_S0000503 DEVELOPERS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY
POD0000006517_S0000006 AS THE PRODUCT IS GROWN
POD0000006517_S0000011 THE NETWORKING NEEDS TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE PLAYERS OPERATING IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT DEMANDS HIGH-BANDWIDTH
POD0000006517_S0000018 WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR
POD0000006517_S0000024 SCRUM MASTERS AND A VARIETY OF OTHER POSITIONS TO HELP PUSH THE TECHNOLOGY FORWARD
POD0000006517_S0000029 THEY'RE A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT'S TRANSFORMING THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY
POD0000006517_S0000036 THAT IS THAT WE PRODUCE A SET OF TOOLS AND A PLATFORM THAT LETS ANYBODY IN THE WORLD CREATE A THREE D MULTIPLAYER ONLINE EXPERIENCE OR GAME
POD0000006517_S0000056 TO A SET OF PLAYER SCRIPTS THAT DESCRIBE HOW OUR THREE D AVATAR WOULD INTERACT WITH ITS ENVIRONMENT IN THE GAME
POD0000006517_S0000071 OKAY
POD0000006517_S0000087 BASICALLY
POD0000006517_S0000099 YOU'VE GOT A GIGANTIC WORLD THAT IS HOSTED ON A SERVER AND IT'S PERIODICALLY SYNCING WITH EACH CLIENT AND GIVING THE CLIENT ENOUGH WORLD TO EXPLORE ON THEIR CLIENT DEVICE
POD0000006517_S0000109 TELL ME ABOUT THE NETWORKING YEAH
POD0000006517_S0000123 OBVIOUSLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF RENDERING HAPPENS ON THE CLIENT
POD0000006517_S0000133 WHEN YOU'RE OUT TO DINNER AND YOUR PHONE BUZZES BECAUSE YOUR ENTIRE APPLICATION IS DOWN
POD0000006517_S0000140 AND THESE TOOLS INCLUDE A COMFORTABLE T-SHIRT
POD0000006517_S0000148 A GAME LIKE ROBLOX HAS SOMETHING CALLED A PHYSICS ENGINE
POD0000006517_S0000165 OBVIOUSLY WE CAN HAVE PHYSICS OWNED LOCALLY ON YOUR CLIENT
POD0000006517_S0000187 WE ARE NOW HAVING TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT NOT JUST WHETHER OR NOT IT'S EFFECTIVE TO MOVE STUFF OUT OF OUR LEGACY ON-PREM DATA CENTER IN CHICAGO INTO THE CLOUD BUT ALSO AT THIS POINT OUR SCALE JUSTIFIES BUILDING OUT OUR OWN GLOBAL ESSENTIALLY PRIVATE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE
POD0000006517_S0000208 WE STILL DO HAVE A CORE OF MONOLITHIC CODEBASE THAT POWERS SOME PERCENTAGE OF THE ROBLOX WWW WEBSITE AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES
POD0000006517_S0000227 SO IT'S DRAMATICALLY MORE IMPORTANT FOR US TO BUILD THE THING RIGHT THAN IT IS FOR US TO BUILD IT ON ANY ARBITRARY TIMELINE
POD0000006517_S0000247 ROBLOX CHOSE A THIRD DOOR THAT'S REALLY UNIQUE TO US
POD0000006517_S0000260 SO WE MADE OUR SCROLLING FRAMES DRAMATICALLY MORE PERFORMANT WE FIXED THE WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF IN TERMS OF HOW WE MANAGE OUR DATA MODELS AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF THE DOG FOODING ASPECT OF THIS WAS HUGE
POD0000006517_S0000270 HERE ARE SOME STATISTICS I FOUND PARTICULARLY USEFUL SIXTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE BUSINESSES IN THE SURVEY WERE ENTIRELY ON AMAZON WEB SERVICES
POD0000006517_S0000277 THANK YOU TO SUMO LOGIC FOR BEING A SPONSOR OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
POD0000006517_S0000301 THEY DISTRIBUTE THEM TO OUR USER BASE AND WE GIVE THEM ALL OF THE TOOLS HOSTING AND INFRASTRUCTURE THEY NEED TO DO THAT FOR FREE
POD0000006517_S0000315 IT'S A GREAT QUESTION FIRST OF ALL IF I KNEW THE EXACT ANSWER TO THAT I'D BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE FOR A LIVING OTHER THAN JUST BUILDING SOFTWARE
POD0000006517_S0000329 IT'S NICE BECAUSE IT MAKES ALL OF THOSE REALLY HARD THINGS AROUND PHYSICS OWNERSHIP AND RENDERING ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF REALLY EASY YOU JUST DO IT ALL ON THE GAME SERVER
POD0000006517_S0000335 RIGHT
POD0000006517_S0000352 AND BETTER DOT COM IS LOOKING FOR ENGINEERS TO JOIN THE TEAM AND BUILD A BETTER MORTGAGE EXPERIENCE
POD0000006517_S0000358 BETTER DOT COM IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING STARTUPS IN NEW YORK AND HAS JUST ANNOUNCED A SERIES C THAT BRINGS THE TOTAL FUNDING TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
POD0000006525_S0000005 OR IN THE DIRT MAP TO HOW THINGS LOOK FROM ABOVE VIA SATELLITE DESCARTES LABS IS A COMPANY THAT GATHERS HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA ABOUT OUR PLANET AND TURNS IT INTO MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TO BE USED BY CUSTOMERS
POD0000006525_S0000011 YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF TECHMEME
POD0000006525_S0000024 WE FOCUS ON WHAT WE CALL REMOTE SENSING
POD0000006525_S0000035 WE MEASURE THINGS LIKE WATER AND MOISTURE CONTENT
POD0000006525_S0000072 YOU OFTEN NEED TEST DATA SETS THAT YOU CAN TRAIN AND TEST AND LABEL FOR MACHINE LEARNING IN THOSE TYPES OF USE CASES
POD0000006525_S0000089 HEROKU CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION AND SEVERAL OTHER HEROKU ENGINEERING PROBLEMS AND PRODUCTS
POD0000006525_S0000120 WE EXTEND THE NUMPY ARRAY
POD0000006525_S0000146 I CAN IMAGINE DATA COMING IN
POD0000006525_S0000162 OR IF WE WRITE IT OURSELVES IT'S USUALLY GOING TO BE PYTHON
POD0000006525_S0000180 YOU'LL HEAR FROM THOUGHT LEADERS ACROSS SCIENCE ACADEMIA AND BUSINESS
POD0000006525_S0000185 I AM ONLY COMFORTABLE USING THAT TERM AI
POD0000006525_S0000207 HERE'S HOW WE UPDATE ALL OF OUR METADATA STORES TO MAKE IT REALLY QUICK AND EASY TO QUERY IT
POD0000006525_S0000242 HOW DOES SOMEONE COME IN
POD0000006525_S0000250 THOSE TYPES OF PROBLEMS DOES KUBEFLOW ADDRESS DATA LINEAGE
POD0000006533_S0000005 AND HASHICORP BEGAN ITERATING ON THEIR BUSINESS MODEL
POD0000006533_S0000010 FIRST ENTERPRISES MOVED FROM SCRIPTED-BASED INFRASTRUCTURE AUTOMATION TO CONTAINER ORCHESTRATION FRAMEWORKS

POD0000006533_S0000096 OR DO YOU SAY YOU KNOW WHAT
POD0000006533_S0000122 SO FROM THE GET GO I THINK WE HAD THIS VISION OF THIS PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS NEEDS TO EXIST
POD0000006533_S0000145 SO CONSOLE
POD0000006533_S0000165 OR IN THE DATABASE BACKEND
POD0000006533_S0000179 OR DO YOU THINK IT'S MORE OF A MULTI-WINNER ENVIRONMENT
POD0000006533_S0000211 SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE GET A BIT OF THAT OVERLAP BETWEEN THE DISCUSSION OF ZERO TRUST AND THE SERVICE MESH
POD0000006533_S0000262 THEN YOU'RE IN WHERE YOU GUYS ARE NOW WHICH IS REALLY GOOD POSITION YOU MADE THE WRONG STRATEGIC DECISIONS YOU'RE IN A REALLY TOUGH SPOT SO TALKING ABOUT STRATEGY HASHICORP BROUGHT ON AN OUTSIDE CEO
POD0000006533_S0000284 MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE FINDING OUT ABOUT DIGITALOCEAN AND REALIZING THAT DIGITALOCEAN IS PERFECT FOR THEIR APPLICATION WORKLOADS
POD0000006533_S0000293 YOU CAN MAKE A HUNDRED DOLLARS GO PRETTY FAR ON DIGITALOCEAN
POD0000006533_S0000307 I MEAN FOR A VERY LONG TIME OUR ONLY MARKETING EXPENSE WAS OUR ANNUAL USER CONFERENCE WE DIDN'T SPONSOR ANY CONFERENCES
POD0000006533_S0000323 BUT IT'S ALSO MUCH LARGER THAN WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT NOW
POD0000006533_S0000368 WHICH IS A GIGANTIC BUSINESS THERE'S LIKE FIVE MAJOR COMPANIES DOING CLOUD COST MANAGEMENT AT LEAST
POD0000006533_S0000390 AND THEY MAKE IT EASY TO INSTALL MONITORING AND LOGGING AND OTHER TOOLING ALONGSIDE YOUR KUBERNETES CLUSTER
POD0000006533_S0000397 AND HE WAS SO GOOD AND SO GENEROUS WITH HIS EXPLANATIONS OF VARIOUS DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS CONCEPTS
POD0000006541_S0000009 THIS IS A NEW PODCAST THAT I STARTED TO TALK ABOUT THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE NEW COMPANY THAT I'M BUILDING WHICH IS CALLED FINDCOLLABS

POD0000006541_S0000038 AND THANKS TO BITBAR
POD0000006541_S0000059 NOBODY LOOKS AT THE TEST CASES
POD0000006541_S0000074 BUT THEY'RE JUST ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE MOST VULNERABILITIES ARE IN THE CUSTOM CODE OF APPLICATIONS
POD0000006541_S0000081 I SPEND MANY YEARS AS A PENETRATION TESTER DOING THIS KIND OF WORK AND REALLY
POD0000006541_S0000090 WE SIT BACK AND WE WATCH
POD0000006541_S0000101 SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE SYNTAX OF THE QUERY ITSELF TO STEAL DATA AND SO ON
POD0000006541_S0000108 WHERE IS THE BEST INSERTION POINT FOR YOUR MONITORING TOOL
POD0000006541_S0000123 IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO FIND SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

POD0000006597_S0000363 TRIPLEBYTE ONLY CARES ABOUT WHETHER SOMEONE CAN CODE
POD0000006605_S0000004 HOWEVER BITCOIN STILL DOES NOT FULFILL THE FINANCIAL USE CASE THAT MOST PEOPLE NEED FROM A CURRENCY PRICE STABILITY THE PRICE OF BITCOIN FLUCTUATES RAPIDLY
POD0000006605_S0000009 BUT EXPENSIVE ENOUGH TO MAKE A PROFIT IT'S HARD TO ASSIGN PRICES TO MARKET GOODS IN TERMS OF BITCOIN
POD0000006605_S0000014 MOST MARKETPLACES ARE DENOMINATED IN US DOLLARS OR OTHER CURRENCIES
POD0000006605_S0000027 I'VE USED DIGITALOCEAN FOR YEARS WHENEVER I WANT TO GET AN APPLICATION OFF THE GROUND QUICKLY
POD0000006605_S0000039 AND OF COURSE COMPUTATION

POD0000006605_S0000143 ULTIMATELY IT'S EASY TO KEEP IT STABLE THROUGH ARBITRAGE BECAUSE IT'S QUITE SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW IF THE STABLECOIN IS LET'S SAY TRADING ON THE MARKET ABOVE ONE DOLLARS
POD0000006605_S0000160 THE DAI STABLECOIN
POD0000006605_S0000201 THAT DO FRACTIONAL RESERVE LENDING
POD0000006605_S0000222 THEY'D MUCH RATHER JUST TAKE A LOAN

POD0000006605_S0000270 WITH SUCH A FRAGMENTED ECOSYSTEM IT'S EASY FOR A BUG TO OCCUR IN A SYSTEM THAT YOU DIDN'T TEST BITBAR IS A PLATFORM FOR MOBILE APP TESTING
POD0000006605_S0000279 YOU GET A FREE MONTH OF MOBILE APPLICATION TESTING ON REAL DEVICES AND THAT'S PRETTY USEFUL
POD0000006605_S0000306 YOU ALSO HAVE TO PAY AN INTEREST RATE
POD0000006605_S0000358 OR YOU CAN TALK ABOUT DIGITALOCEAN
POD0000006605_S0000379 YOU CAN MODEL YOUR DEPLOYMENT PIPELINES WITHOUT INSTALLING ANY PLUGINS YOU CAN USE THE VALUE STREAM MAP TO VISUALIZE YOUR END-TO-END WORKFLOW
POD0000006613_S0000006 ONE OF THESE TOOLS IS STORYBOOK
POD0000006613_S0000014 SUCH AS DROPBOX ASANA AND REDDIT AFTER YOU'RE IN THE TRIPLEBYTE SYSTEM YOU STAY THERE SAVING YOU TONS OF TIME AND ENERGY
POD0000006613_S0000023 BYTE AS IN EIGHT BYTES
POD0000006613_S0000049 THERE ARE COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS THAT CAN LEAD TO CONFLICTS
POD0000006613_S0000088 TWEAK IT ADD SOME MORE FUNCTIONALITY AND THEN VERY EASILY IN FACT IT'S ALREADY INTEGRATED INTO THE MAIN APPLICATION
POD0000006613_S0000119 WHETHER YOU ARE A SOFTWARE ENGINEER OR A PROJECT MANAGER
POD0000006613_S0000126 THAT'S WHY COMPANIES LIKE ELASTIC AND SPLICE AND NEW BANK ALL USE CLUBHOUSE
POD0000006613_S0000148 CAN YOU GIVE ME A HISTORY OF HOW THE OPEN SOURCE PROJECT HAS MATURED
POD0000006613_S0000191 CAN SIMPLY LOOK THROUGH THOSE CHANGES AND EITHER FLAG VISUAL REGRESSIONS THINGS THAT DON'T LOOK RIGHT
POD0000006613_S0000217 THEY'RE OFTENTIMES RENDERED AND CALCULATED AND PROCESSED IN THE BROWSER ON THE CLIENT-SIDE
POD0000006613_S0000245 YEAH WHAT WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN IS DIGGING DEEPER INTO THIS DESIGN DEVELOPMENT HANDOFF AND HANG BACK AS WE'RE STARTING TO CALL IT FROM DEVELOPMENT TO DESIGN
POD0000006613_S0000282 WHAT'S YOUR IMPRESSION OF HOW GRAPHQL IS IMPACTING THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT WORLD TODAY
POD0000006613_S0000293 OR CICD WORKLOADS
POD0000006621_S0000010 AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE STRIPE ATLAS BECOME SOMETHING HUGE
POD0000006621_S0000015 ELIMINATE THE COMPLICATED PLANNING AND DEPLOYMENT OF FULLY ORCHESTRATED CONTAINERIZED APPLICATIONS WITH KUBERNETES
POD0000006621_S0000020 ALSO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY SCALE TO MAXIMIZE YOUR RESOURCE UTILIZATION WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE YOUR APPLICATIONS OFF-LINE
POD0000006621_S0000029 GIVE THE LISTENERS AN OVERVIEW OF YOUR BUSINESS BACKGROUND HOW DID YOU WIND UP AT STRIPE
POD0000006621_S0000064 THAT PROCESS IS ACTUALLY DIFFICULT
POD0000006621_S0000085 THE STUFF THAT DOESN'T ADD VALUE LIKE YOUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION FOR A COMPANY
POD0000006621_S0000115 THEY CRAVE LITTLE CARS ZOOMING AROUND ON THE MAP
POD0000006621_S0000120 ON MOBILE PHONES
POD0000006621_S0000130 AND ACCESS MANAGER TO THWART TROLLS AND HACKERS
POD0000006621_S0000145 THAT SEEMS LIKE AN ENGINEERING CHALLENGE
POD0000006621_S0000156 TODAY TODAY
POD0000006621_S0000179 AND THEN SOMETIMES AFTER APPLYING THE ELBOW GREASE FOR A FEW TIMES IT'S LIKE OKAY
POD0000006621_S0000213 THEN WE ATTEMPT TO DO EXPERIMENTS THAT PROVE OUT THAT WE COULD BE USEFUL WITH REGARDS TO PARTICULAR THINGS
POD0000006621_S0000234 THESE DIFFERENT TEAMS NEED TO COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER
POD0000006621_S0000240 TO PRODUCT MANAGERS BUILDING FEATURE ROADMAPS
POD0000006621_S0000246 IT'S EASY TO GET STARTED WITH AIRTABLE BUT AS YOU GET MORE EXPERIENCE WITH IT YOU WILL SEE HOW FLEXIBLE AND POWERFUL IT IS
POD0000006621_S0000267 THERE ARE SOME UNSURPRISING SURPRISES
POD0000006621_S0000328 PERMANENCE
POD0000006621_S0000348 LIKE READING THESE PHYSICAL PIECES OF MAIL THAT ARE HARD TO PARSE
POD0000006621_S0000363 PLEASE DEAR GOD TAKE THESE THINGS AWAY FROM ME IF YOU CAN
POD0000006621_S0000386 BUT THERE ARE QUARTERLY GOALS JUST LIKE THERE ARE ANYWHERE
POD0000006629_S0000005 WHICH ALSO INCLUDES ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS EPICENTER
POD0000006629_S0000014 POST YOUR PROJECT
POD0000006629_S0000020 YOU CAN QUICKLY PROVISION CLUSTERS TO BE UP AND RUNNING IN NO TIME WHILE SIMPLIFYING YOUR MONITORING AND CLUSTER MANAGEMENT THROUGH AUTO UPGRADES AND A BUILT-IN OPERATIONS CONSOLE
POD0000006629_S0000025 ISOLATE YOUR APPLICATION FROM INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES AND TRANSPARENTLY SCALE THE UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE TO MEET GROWING DEMANDS
POD0000006629_S0000034 SO IT HAS SERVED AS SOMETHING OF AN INSPIRATION FOR SOME OF THE FORMATS AND THE PATHS THAT I'VE TRAVELED WITH SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAILY
POD0000006629_S0000052 IN THE EARLY DAYS CONTENT WAS NOT DENSE IT WAS EITHER TOO DENSE LIKE ON FORUMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND THAT'S WHERE I WAS GETTING ALL MY INFORMATION IN THE EARLY DAYS
POD0000006629_S0000074 ANDREA ANTONOPOULOS GOT INVOLVED BECAUSE HE AND I HAD TALKED ABOUT HIM ACTUALLY BEING A HOST ON THE DAILY BITCOIN SHOW BUT IT WOUND UP THAT HE WAS TRAVELING TOO MUCH AND WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO GET IT GOING
POD0000006629_S0000087 BUT IN GENERAL
POD0000006629_S0000107 I THINK NPR YOU COULD THINK OF IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL PODCAST NETWORK SO I DON'T KNOW I'M FASCINATED BY THE ECONOMICS OF THE PODCAST NETWORK WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR OBSERVATION OF THE PODCAST NETWORK BUSINESS MODEL
POD0000006629_S0000117 BUT RELATIVE TO THE AVAILABLE MARKET

POD0000006629_S0000162 HERE'S HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN THAT BROADCAST RADIUS
POD0000006629_S0000181 AND BASED ON WHATEVER THE CONTENTS ARE
POD0000006629_S0000198 SO THERE ARE LAYER ONE PROTOCOLS RIGHT SO SOMETHING LIKE BITCOIN
POD0000006629_S0000220 SO THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU ACTUALLY NEEDED TO THE ONLY THING YOU NEEDED TO DO IN ORDER TO GAMBLE WITH SATOSHI DICE WAS TO LITERALLY SEND BITCOIN TO THE APPROPRIATE ADDRESS
POD0000006629_S0000227 WOULD EFFECTIVELY BECOME A WINDOW INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S WEBSITE WHERE YOU COULD PERFORM THE TRANSACTION RIGHT THERE
POD0000006629_S0000243 WE'VE FOUND THE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CYCLE TO BE PRETTY COMPLEX THOUGH AND A LOT OF TIMES WHAT WE WOULD RUN INTO IS THAT WE WERE SO EARLY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WE WERE WORKING WITH AND TRYING TO HELP WANTED TO DO EVERYTHING THEMSELVES EVEN IF IT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE DETRIMENT OF THEIR PROJECT
POD0000006629_S0000251 SO IN OUR SOLUTION WE MADE IT SO THAT EVEN THOUGH THE SYSTEM WAS ENTIRELY TOKEN-BACKED IN TERMS OF THE OWNERSHIP MODEL AND THINGS LIKE THAT

YOU0000000113_S0000041 I'M PARTICULARLY EXCITED TO HEAR THESE TO LAUNCH OUR DISCUSSION ON THIS TOPIC
YOU0000000113_S0000047 SO MIKE HAS MADE US A VIDEO TO EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT
YOU0000000113_S0000052 ROCK-STAR EDGE YOUTUBERS LIKE MARK ROBER AND EVEN TRAVEL TUBERS CAN OFFER SOMETHING TO ASPIRE TO IF YOU'RE AN ANTHROPOLOGIST LIKE ME
YOU0000000113_S0000057 AND MOST RECENTLY I STARTED TAKING MY CAMERA OUT INTO THE WORLD TO SHARE MY ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELD EXPERIENCES WITH MY STUDENTS
YOU0000000113_S0000062 A VIDEO MICRO LECTURE
YOU0000000113_S0000067 HI
YOU0000000113_S0000078 I'M TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE BE LESS WEIRD ABOUT IT

YOU0000000113_S0000094 SO TALKING ON CAMERA CAN BE SUPER HARD BUT I WANNA GIVE YOU FIVE TIPS JUST TO GET STARTED
YOU0000000113_S0000100 BECAUSE WHEN YOU JUST RECORD YOURSELF IN FRONT OF A CAMERA YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THAT ENERGY THAT YOU TYPICALLY GET IN A SOCIAL SITUATION
YOU0000000113_S0000105 SO YOU HAVE TO GO A LITTLE BIT ABOVE WHAT YOU THINK IS NATURAL GO TO LIKE A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AND IT SHOULD LOOK JUST ABOUT RIGHT NUMBER THREE HAVE A PLAN
YOU0000000113_S0000111 YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND TOO LONG ON A TOPIC OR GO TOO FAST YOU GOT TO HAVE A NICE PACE THAT FEELS JUST RIGHT
YOU0000000113_S0000117 I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSION TODAY
YOU0000000113_S0000129 I WANTED TO JUST
YOU0000000113_S0000144 AND THEN I ALSO THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND MIKE COMMENTED ON THIS THE SOCIAL PRESENCE ELEMENT
YOU0000000113_S0000169 AND I THINK THE STUDENTS REALLY APPRECIATE HAVING THIS RESOURCE TO GO BACK TO
YOU0000000113_S0000182 AND MAYBE YOU FEEL LIKE A CONCEPT TAKES LIKE
YOU0000000113_S0000190 BUT YOU'RE DOING LOTS OF THOSE FIVE MINUTE THINGS
YOU0000000113_S0000206 THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE IS THE LIGHT SOURCE
YOU0000000113_S0000214 I DID HAVE A FIFTEEN DOLLAR LITTLE LAPEL MIC CONNECTED TO ME
YOU0000000113_S0000229 FOR SCREENCAPS OF COURSE LIGHTING SOURCE DOESN'T QUITE MATTER BUT YOU DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DISPLAYING TO YOUR STUDENTS AND THAT IT'S HIGH QUALITY
YOU0000000113_S0000241 EVEN THOUGH YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DOING IT LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IT LIVE SO YOU DO HAVE TO GIVE THAT EXTRA AND WHEN WHEN IS IT THE BEST TIME TO DO THAT AND WHAT RESOURCES DO YOU NEED TO HAVE AROUND YOU AS YOU SIT DOWN TO DO THAT WORK AND WHEN I MAKE RECORDINGS IT'S A MESS I HAVE PAPERS ALL AROUND ME BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WANT TO PICK UP AND HOLD IN MY HAND AT A MOMENT
YOU0000000113_S0000250 IT FEELS ARTIFICIAL BECAUSE YOU ARE TALKING TO A CAMERA
YOU0000000113_S0000259 YEAH I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD START WITH
YOU0000000113_S0000265 BUT IF YOU'RE A DYNAMIC PRESENTER MAYBE THAT'S OK BECAUSE YOU'RE BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE AND YOU BEING THERE MAKES A DIFFERENCE
YOU0000000113_S0000274 COUNSEL AGAINST THE IDEA OF JUST READING THROUGH POWERPOINT SLIDES WITHOUT BEING PRESENT IN SOME WAY LIKE WITHOUT BEING DYNAMICALLY ENGAGED AND PRESENT
YOU0000000113_S0000283 AND I FIND IT REALLY LIBERATING TO JUST HAVE THE SCREEN CAST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT HOW I LOOK WHEN I SIT DOWN TO MAKE THE RECORDING
YOU0000000113_S0000298 YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED THAT THEY ACTUALLY DID IT IN POWERPOINT
YOU0000000113_S0000315 HOW DO I KNOW THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH TO TAKE WITH THE PROBLEM WELL I'LL TELL YOU AS I'M WORKING THE PROBLEM
YOU0000000113_S0000328 AND SO I JUST WENT OUT IN KANSAS CITY AND I JUST SORT OF
YOU0000000113_S0000340 AND SO I PUT IT OUT PUBLICLY
YOU0000000113_S0000346 I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO BE
YOU0000000113_S0000355 JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO OFFER
YOU0000000113_S0000370 BUT FOR EXAMPLE ON OUR CAMPUS WE HAVE SOME SOME PEOPLE WHO THAT IS THERE THEIR ROLE IS TO SORT OF HELP US THINK ABOUT HOW TO CREATE MORE ACCESSIBLE CONTENT FOR OUR STUDENTS
YOU0000000113_S0000387 AND IF YOU HAVE A TEEN WHO IS TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO TYPE
YOU0000000113_S0000398 AND YES HAVING CLOSED CAPTIONS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ALL THOSE REASONS
YOU0000000113_S0000408 AND I DON'T SAY NECESSARILY I'M AGAINST THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE STUDENTS KIND OF START TO FEEL LIKE HEY WAIT WHO'S TEACHING ME HERE IS KHAN ACADEMY OR AM I ACTUALLY BEING TAUGHT BY PROFESSOR IN MY FIELD IT'S QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE
YOU0000000113_S0000418 BUT IF YOU'RE ALWAYS PRESENTING SOMEONE ELSE'S MATERIALS
YOU0000000113_S0000429 AND THEN HERE'S THE VIDEO
YOU0000000113_S0000440 NO LONGER THAN FIVE OR SIX MINUTES IF I CAN AVOID IT
YOU0000000113_S0000458 MINE WOULD BE START SMALL BUT DREAM BIG
YOU0000000113_S0000464 I SORT OF SEE MY CAREER DEVELOPING OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS MORE AND MORE TOWARD THE VIDEO PLATFORM
YOU0000000113_S0000477 SO BE KIND TO YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA FEEL TIRED OF EVEN RECORDING JUST A FIVE MINUTE VIDEO
YOU0000000113_S0000490 SO THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH US AT ACUE KNOW THAT OUR MISSION IS STUDENT SUCCESS THROUGH EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION WHICH WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT TODAY
YOU0000000113_S0000496 OUR LAST THING ABOUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT EVERYTHING WE'VE REFERENCED TODAY IS AVAILABLE AT THE ACUE WEB SITE

YOU0000000171_S0001237 TO EXPRESS
YOU0000000171_S0001242 HE WANDERED ABOUT THE PRECINCTS AND SPECULATED ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE RIPE AND COSY HOUSES OF GREY STONE THAT CLUSTER THERE SO COMFORTABLY
YOU0000000171_S0001249 PARTICULARLY HE RESPONDED TO THE RUINED ARCHES OF THE BENEDICTINE'S INFIRMARY AND THE VIEW OF BELL HARRY TOWER FROM THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS
YOU0000000171_S0001255 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WOMAN
YOU0000000171_S0001261 AND VERY DETERMINED AND METHODICAL PEOPLE MUCH MORE SO THAN ANY ENGLISH HE KNEW
YOU0000000171_S0001266 HE HAD OVERHEARD A LITTLE LADY PUTTING HER VIEW TO A FRIEND NEAR THE CHRISTCHURCH GATE
YOU0000000171_S0001271 WE'VE NO TIME FOR SIDE SHOWS AND SECOND RATE STUNTS MAMIE
YOU0000000171_S0001279 FINDING THEM FULL OF AN INDESCRIBABLE FLAVOUR
YOU0000000171_S0001285 ALBEIT A VERY DESERT SO FAR AS COMPANIONSHIP WENT
YOU0000000171_S0001291 THOUGH WHAT TRADE HE OUGHT TO HAVE CHOSEN WAS BY NO MEANS CLEAR
YOU0000000171_S0001298 THE BORN HUSTLERS
YOU0000000171_S0001304 WHEN THEY TURNED THEY FOUND THE RIVER TOO NARROW FOR TACKING AND THE TIDE RUNNING OUT LIKE A SLUICE
YOU0000000171_S0001311 SAID MR POLLY FEELING THAT THINGS WERE NOT SO BAD
YOU0000000171_S0001318 SO MR POLLY RESUMED HIS OBSERVATIONS IN THE WOOD STREET WAREHOUSES ONCE MORE
YOU0000000171_S0001323 IT WASN'T ANY GOOD FOR HIM NOW
YOU0000000171_S0001329 BUT ADMITTED UPON REFLECTION HIS GENERAL WANT OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE
YOU0000000171_S0001335 FED ITS ASSISTANTS IN AN UNDERGROUND DINING-ROOM AND KEPT THEM UNTIL TWELVE ON SATURDAYS
YOU0000000171_S0001340 THE CHIEF SHOPWALKER TOOK A DISLIKE TO HIM AND NAGGED HIM
YOU0000000171_S0001346 BUT NO ZEST
YOU0000000171_S0001351 IT FINDS ITSELF AT LAST FOR A LONG NIGHT OF FLOUNDERING EFFORT AND PERPLEXITY
YOU0000000171_S0001359 HE FELT THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING STUPID ABOUT HIS SCHOOL
YOU0000000171_S0001365 AND FOR ALL HIS ATTEMPTS AT SELF-REPROACH OR SELF-DISCIPLINE HE FELT AT BOTTOM THAT HE WASN'T AT FAULT
YOU0000000171_S0001379 THEN A GREAT CHANGE WAS BROUGHT ABOUT IN THE LIFE OF MR POLLY BY THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER
YOU0000000171_S0001385 A GOLD LOCKET FORMERLY BELONGING TO HIS MOTHER
YOU0000000171_S0001390 AND HIS FATHER BEING OF A RESERVED NATURE IN HIS DECLINING YEARS HAD SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE INSURANCE POLICY
YOU0000000171_S0001395 AND THE AUNT WHO HAD SUCCEEDED HIS MOTHER WAS AN ECONOMIST AND FURNITURE POLISHER
YOU0000000171_S0001400 AND HE HAD GROWN UP WITH A TATTERED AND DISSIPATED AFFECTIONATENESS THAT WAS BECOMING WILDLY SHY
YOU0000000171_S0001406 BUT IT DID NOT TEAR MR POLLY'S HEARTSTRINGS AT FIRST SO MUCH AS ROUSE HIM TO A PITCH OF VIVID ATTENTION
YOU0000000171_S0001411 WITH A FACE UNWONTEDLY QUIET AND AS IT SEEMED WITH ITS PINCHED NOSTRILS
YOU0000000171_S0001416 IT WAS A MERCIFUL RELIEF
YOU0000000171_S0001422 FEELING IT NECESSARY TO SAY SOMETHING
YOU0000000171_S0001428 JOHNSON MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR
YOU0000000171_S0001433 OF JOLLY MOMENTS WHEN HIS FATHER HAD SKYLARKED WITH A WILDLY EXCITED LITTLE BOY

YOU0000000171_S0001445 THE SHOCKED DISCOVERY OF HIS FATHER'S PERFECT HUMANITY
YOU0000000171_S0001450 A WEAKLY WILFUL BEING STRUGGLING TO GET OBDURATE THINGS ROUND IMPOSSIBLE CORNERS
YOU0000000171_S0001455 FINISHED
YOU0000000171_S0001460 HE WAS THE UP-LINE TICKET CLERK AT EASEWOOD JUNCTION
YOU0000000171_S0001465 AND HIS DARK GREY EYES WERE DEEPLY SET
YOU0000000171_S0001470 AND HE WATCHED CRITICALLY
YOU0000000171_S0001475 AND AN EARNEST AND PERSISTENT READER OF THE BRITISH WEEKLY
YOU0000000171_S0001481 EVEN WHEN IT WAS NOT REALLY BRIGHT AND HOPEFUL
YOU0000000171_S0001487 QUITE CHEERFUL

YOU0000000171_S0001498 YOU'LL HAVE A HEARSE OF COURSE
YOU0000000171_S0001503 SHE FLATTENED HER VOICE IN A MANNER SHE USED TO INTIMATE AESTHETIC FEELING
YOU0000000171_S0001508 SAID JOHNSON CONCLUSIVELY
YOU0000000171_S0001514 THEN YOU'LL WANT A MOURNER'S CARRIAGE OR TWO
YOU0000000171_S0001519 OH YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK A FEW FRIENDS
YOU0000000171_S0001525 BUT OF COURSE YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING
YOU0000000171_S0001533 YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT
YOU0000000171_S0001542 THERE'D HAVE TO BE WHISKEY AND SHERRY OR PORT FOR THE LADIES
YOU0000000171_S0001548 HE HATED BLACK GARMENTS
YOU0000000171_S0001554 SAID MR POLLY INDISTINCTLY

YOU0000000171_S0001580 WISH I'D LOOKED HIM UP A BIT MORE WHILE HE WAS ALIVE
YOU0000000171_S0001587 DON'T SEEM TO GET THE HANG OF THE BUSINESS SOMEHOW
YOU0000000171_S0001593 THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD DO
YOU0000000171_S0001598 THINK OF INVESTING YOUR MONEY
YOU0000000171_S0001603 HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET IN THAT LIGHT
YOU0000000171_S0001610 IT'S A NEST EGG
YOU0000000171_S0001616 YOU MIGHT LEND IT ON MORTGAGE
YOU0000000171_S0001621 THEY TURNED A CORNER THAT LED TOWARDS THE JUNCTION
YOU0000000171_S0001627 IT FELL INTO HIS MIND LIKE SOME SMALL OBSCURE SEED
YOU0000000171_S0001632 THE SPACE FOR THE SHOP YAWNED AN OBLONG GAP BELOW
YOU0000000171_S0001637 AND LED THE WAY INTO THE ESTABLISHMENT
YOU0000000171_S0001643 ROOMS IN A NEW HOUSE ALWAYS LOOK A BIT SMALL
YOU0000000171_S0001650 THE WIFE WAS A PRETTY WOMAN IN BROWN WITH A FLORIFEROUS STRAW HAT
YOU0000000171_S0001655 GREETINGS WERE EXCHANGED BETWEEN MR JOHNSON AND THIS DISTINGUISHED COMESTIBLE

YOU0000000171_S0001691 SO THAT THESE RATHER BRILLIANT LANDSCAPES WERE HIDDEN AND ONLY THE PLAIN BLUE ENAMEL SHOWED
YOU0000000171_S0001698 SHE SENT THEM OUT TOGETHER BECAUSE SHE HAD A QUEER LITTLE PERSUASION AT THE BACK OF HER MIND THAT MR POLLY WANTED TO BOLT FROM HIS SACRED DUTIES
YOU0000000171_S0001703 WRINKLES NEATLY APPLIED AND DIFFICULTIES WISELY OVERCOME
YOU0000000171_S0001708 DEMONSTRATIVE MANNERS AND EMPHATIC MOURNING
YOU0000000171_S0001746 STILL THAT CONGESTION OF STRANGERS IN BLACK SUFFICED TO STUN AND CONFUSE MR POLLY'S IMPRESSIONABLE MIND
YOU0000000171_S0001753 SAID MRS JOHNSON

YOU0000000171_S0004622 THE IRONMONGER
YOU0000000171_S0004627 HE WAS STANDING AT HIS DOOR ONE DAY FEELING BORED

YOU0000000171_S0004710 HE CAME TO HATE THE VERY SIGHT
YOU0000000171_S0004717 THE AIR WAS TASTELESS BY REASON OF THEM
YOU0000000171_S0004722 ONE OF HIS LAST FRIENDSHIPS WAS WITH RUSPER
YOU0000000171_S0004727 HAD BELONGED TO A LITERARY SOCIETY SOMEWHERE ONCE
YOU0000000171_S0004732 AND THAT ART WAS PEDAGOGY IN FANCY DRESS

YOU0000000171_S0004769 YES
YOU0000000171_S0004775 AFTER THAT
YOU0000000171_S0004782 AND THEN MR RUSPER PURSUING INCOMPREHENSIBLE LINES OF THOUGHT
YOU0000000171_S0004787 AND PRODUCED IN HIS THROAT A COUGH OF SINGULAR SCORNFULNESS
YOU0000000171_S0004793 IT CORRESPONDS TO THAT EPOCH IN HUMAN DECAY WHEN AN OLD GENTLEMAN LOSES AN INCISOR TOOTH
YOU0000000171_S0004799 BEFORE HE COULD DISMOUNT ACCORDING TO HIS HABIT THE PEDAL HAD TO MAKE A REVOLUTION
YOU0000000171_S0004805 HE SENT A COLUMN OF PAILS THUNDERING ACROSS THE DOORWAY AND DISMOUNTED WITH ONE FOOT IN A SANITARY DUSTBIN AMIDST AN ENORMOUS UPROAR OF FALLING IRONMONGERY
YOU0000000171_S0004810 HE GESTICULATED SPEECHLESSLY FOR A MOMENT
YOU0000000171_S0004816 AND MR POLLY IN ATTEMPTING A DIGNIFIED MOVEMENT REALISED HIS ENTANGLEMENT WITH THE DUSTBIN FOR THE FIRST TIME
YOU0000000171_S0004825 MR RUSPER LAID ONE HAND ON THE BICYCLE HANDLE
YOU0000000171_S0004832 RELEASED THE BICYCLE HANDLE SEIZED MR POLLY BY THE CAP AND HAIR AND BORE HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS DOWNWARD

YOU0000000171_S0004926 TO HAVE ALL THE TRADESMEN IN THE PLACE SCRAPPING ABOUT THE PAVEMENT OF AN AFTERNOON
YOU0000000171_S0004932 SAID THE COLLEAGUE TO THE RIGHT
YOU0000000171_S0004939 WHAT WOULD MIRIAM SAY WHEN SHE LEARNT THIS
YOU0000000171_S0004945 SUCH THOUGHTS AS THESE REQUIRE NO AID FROM UNDIGESTED COLD PORK AND COLD POTATOES AND PICKLES TO DARKEN THE SOUL
YOU0000000171_S0004950 AND SAT ROUND AND PUT A LEG OVER THE STILE
YOU0000000171_S0004956 LIFE HE FELT HAD NO FURTHER HAPPINESS TO OFFER HIM
YOU0000000171_S0004962 LIFE'S INSURED

YOU0000000171_S0004974 HE WOULD HAVE TO DO THE THING SECRETLY AND ELABORATELY
YOU0000000171_S0004979 HIS DINNER AND THE EAST WIND LOST THEIR SINISTER HOLD UPON HIS SOUL
YOU0000000171_S0004985 AND SINCE HE AND MIRIAM RARELY TALKED AND MIRIAM THOUGHT HONOUR AND HIS RECENT BEHAVIOUR DEMANDED A HOSTILE SILENCE

YOU0000000211_S0000042 CUT AN ONION IN HALF AND SLICE DOWN THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE ONION JUST SO WE DON'T END UP WITH PIECES THAT ARE TOO LONG
YOU0000000211_S0000047 ONE TABLESPOON OF HONEY THOUGH YOU COULD ALWAYS ADD MORE IF YOU'D LIKE IT SWEETER
YOU0000000211_S0000052 THEN POUR THE DRESSING ON TOP OF THE CABBAGE GIVE THIS COLESLAW A STIR AND ENJOY
YOU0000000219_S0000031 SO

YOU0000000227_S0000051 THAT'S IT PLEASE CHECK OUT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR DEVELOPING WITH DOCUSIGN AT OUR DEVCENTER
YOU0000000235_S0000020 THEN IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO JUGGLE READING AS WELL AS TIMING YOURSELF YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY DILIGENT WITH YOUR TIMINGS IN ORDER FOR THE APP TO WORK
YOU0000000243_S0000011 INFORMATION AND RESOURCES THAT THEY CAN USE TO MORE CLOSELY EXAMINE EFFORTS IN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO PROMOTE TRUSTING PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN PROFESSIONALS AND FAMILIES
YOU0000000243_S0000019 BUT THIS WEEK
YOU0000000243_S0000029 THIS JUST PERVADED SO MUCH
YOU0000000243_S0000045 SO THIS MATTER OF HONORING ONE'S CULTURAL DIVERSITY WAS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT AND THE OTHER PART OF IT WAS
YOU0000000243_S0000065 OKAY
YOU0000000243_S0000073 TELLING YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS GOING ON IN THEIR LIFE BECAUSE
YOU0000000243_S0000081 I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE OUTCOME OF AN ERRONEOUS DECISION FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE BECAUSE I WILL BE CARING FOR MY CHILD UNTIL I'M GONE FROM THIS PLANET AND I HAVE TO REAP THE CONSEQUENCES
YOU0000000243_S0000090 YOU DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE ADVOCATE FOR THEM
YOU0000000243_S0000100 BUT BEFORE DOING THAT
YOU0000000243_S0000111 TAKE IT UP
YOU0000000243_S0000117 I AM HERE MY NAME IS DEE GETHMANN AND I AM HERE WITH MY FAMILY PARTNERS KAREN THOMPSON AND ALICIA KARWAL
YOU0000000243_S0000123 AS WE WENT THROUGH THAT TOOL WE REALIZED THAT MANY TIMES WE HAD ELEMENTS OF THE QUALITY INDICATOR
YOU0000000243_S0000136 THIS INVOLVES COMMUNICATION AND THE COMPETENCE AND RESPECT FOR FAMILIES AND COMMITMENT EQUALITY AND ADVOCACY
YOU0000000243_S0000144 ONE OF OUR FIRST DISCUSSIONS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS WAS TO ESTABLISH OUR VISION AND MISSION
YOU0000000243_S0000150 SPEAKS TO OUR TEAM AS WELL
YOU0000000243_S0000167 THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT FIVE OF US OR SIX OF US REPRESENTING THE GROUP
YOU0000000243_S0000177 AS YOU CAN SEE THE GOALS OF OUR TEAM DEVELOPED AROUND KIND OF SEEKING OUT INFORMATION FROM FAMILIES AND PRACTITIONERS AND LEADERSHIP
YOU0000000243_S0000193 WAS THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR DEPTH AND AUTHENTICITY IN WORKING WITH FAMILIES
YOU0000000243_S0000206 THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORK IS TO BUILD AND ALWAYS INCLUDE FAMILIES IN THE WORK THAT WE DO
YOU0000000243_S0000217 DESIGN TEAM IF YOU WILL THAT PARTNERSHIP
YOU0000000243_S0000244 FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS AT THE TABLE TOGETHER WORKING
YOU0000000243_S0000253 DESIGNED THE CONCEPT OF DIAGNOSE
YOU0000000243_S0000259 ESSENTIALLY WE ASKED OURSELVES THE QUESTION WHEN ANY PARENT WHEN ANY PROFESSIONAL WHEN ANY COMMUNITY MEMBER WALKS INTO CLASSROOM OR INTO A SETTING WHERE SPECIALLY DESIGNED INSTRUCTION
YOU0000000243_S0000267 AND THE INTENTION IS THAT WORK SUPPORTS DIAGNOSE DESIGN AND DELIVER
YOU0000000243_S0000277 WE USED ONE OF THE TOOLS THE AUTHENTIC CHILD ASSESSMENT PRACTICES CHECKLIST
YOU0000000243_S0000282 ENGAGEMENT IN THEIR LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES
YOU0000000243_S0000292 WHAT STRUCK YOU ABOUT PARTNERSHIP PRINCIPLES AND SYSTEMS WORK
YOU0000000243_S0000300 AND YOU CANNOT DO THE JOB EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO BE A PARTNER WITH SOMEBODY
YOU0000000243_S0000313 THESE ARE TOOLS DEVELOPED BY MY COLLEAGUES AT THE BEACH CENTER ON DISABILITY AND THESE TOOLS ALIGN WITH THE PARTNERSHIP PRINCIPLES
YOU0000000243_S0000323 AND BRANDI WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO YOU WELCOME
YOU0000000243_S0000339 BUT HERE IS THE EXCITING PART WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN THIS TOO
YOU0000000243_S0000348 THIS IS THE SYSTEMS COLUMN
YOU0000000243_S0000356 ONE OF THE OTHER FOUNDATIONS OR SYSTEMIC ISSUES SYSTEMIC SORT OF SUPPORTS THAT HELP GUIDE WHAT IS THIS THEORY OF CHANGE NOW
YOU0000000243_S0000363 THAT'S WITH AND BESIDE EACH OTHER OUR COMMUNITIES
YOU0000000243_S0000374 THE FIRST ATTITUDE IS FAMILIES ARE THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT TEACHERS OF THEIR CHILDREN FAMILIES ARE PARTNERS WITH THEIR CRITICAL ROLE IN THEIR FAMILY'S DEVELOPMENT
YOU0000000243_S0000387 AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENT AS WELL WE HAVE A WHOLE OTHER CHAPTER THAT ALLOWS FOR A REFLECTIVE SUPERVISION INTERACTION SO
YOU0000000243_S0000399 VALUE THE FAMILY'S PASSION REFLECT ON YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE
YOU0000000243_S0000413 ANY TIME YOU USE OUR RESOURCES YOU'RE GOING TO FIND VERY QUICKLY THAT EVERYTHING IS ANCHORED IN THAT THEORY OF CHANGE IN THE FRAMEWORK
YOU0000000243_S0000429 ON PAGE SIXTEEN
YOU0000000243_S0000439 NOW IF YOU COME WITH ME DOWN TO PAGE THIRTY ONE I BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING TO DISCOVER AGAIN THE FAMILY MAP INVENTORIES AND WE HAVE THREE PAGES OF INFORMATION THAT SHOWCASE FOR YOU
YOU0000000243_S0000451 THE SIX PRINCIPLES
YOU0000000243_S0000459 AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE FLIP ABOUT IT
YOU0000000243_S0000469 WE TALKED ABOUT THE BIG PICTURES
YOU0000000243_S0000475 WE THEN SAID IF YOU PRACTICE IT AT THAT LEVEL
YOU0000000243_S0000481 IT IS THAT FAMILIES ARE THE FOUNDATION OF SOCIETY THEY ARE THE CORE UNIT
YOU0000000243_S0000486 INDEPENDENT LIVING
YOU0000000243_S0000492 AND OUTCOMES
YOU0000000251_S0000003 HEY KID
YOU0000000251_S0000010 FIFTY EIGHT HUNDRED SECONDS LATER
YOU0000000259_S0000004 ADD A FIELD DIRECTLY TO YOUR CLASS FOR THE DATA YOU WANT TO STORE AND LOOK UP LATER
YOU0000000259_S0000011 YOU CAN COMBINE INHERITEDWIDGET WITH SOMETHING LIKE VALUENOTIFIER OR CHANGENOTIFIER
YOU0000000267_S0000007 BUT IF YOU WANT MORE CONTROL OVER THE FINISHED PRODUCT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE OPTIONS BELOW
YOU0000000267_S0000012 A WORKSHEET IS CONSIDERED ACTIVE WHEN IT'S SELECTED LIKE THE CENTRAL SHEET IS SELECTED NOW
YOU0000000267_S0000018 HOWEVER THAT'S NOT QUITE WHAT I WANT
YOU0000000267_S0000026 DOWN TO PRINT SELECTION
YOU0000000267_S0000031 IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND OR NO LONGER NEED IT CHOOSE CLEAR TO REMOVE IT
YOU0000000267_S0000036 AND CHOOSE FIT ALL COLUMNS ON ONE PAGE
YOU0000000267_S0000041 THEN TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW THE DATA IS BEING ARRANGED
YOU0000000267_S0000046 ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO TO THE PAGE LAYOUT TAB
YOU0000000267_S0000052 THEN CLICK THE BUTTON TO GO BACK
YOU0000000267_S0000057 THERE'S ONE MORE THING I'D LIKE TO ADJUST WHILE I'M HERE
YOU0000000267_S0000063 ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CLICK AND DRAG THE BLUE DOTTED LINE
YOU0000000267_S0000068 I BET WE COULD FIX THAT BY MAKING THE MARGINS A LITTLE SMALLER
YOU0000000267_S0000073 NOW I'M READY TO PRINT
YOU0000000275_S0000008 I DO A NEWSLETTER EVERY TWO MONTHS FOR JUST PRACTITIONERS ONLY FOR FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE DOCS
YOU0000000275_S0000016 HE SPENT HIS EARLY LIFE IN THE NICU AND MANY ANTIBIOTICS
YOU0000000275_S0000024 SO
YOU0000000275_S0000033 HE WAS SKIING AND HE HIT HIS HEAD
YOU0000000275_S0000042 SO PLEASE DON'T LET IT BE THAT I'M AGAINST THOSE DRUGS BUT CERTAINLY IF WE CAN FIND THE ROOT CAUSE BEFORE THEY HAVE TO GO ON THEM THAT WOULD BE THE BEST CASE SCENARIO
YOU0000000275_S0000050 ELECTROLYTES BECAUSE OF THE DIARRHEA AND HE WAS LOSING LOTS OF FLUIDS AND HIGH-DOSE PROBIOTICS
YOU0000000275_S0000063 IF YOU HAVE A NORMAL CALPROTECTIN
YOU0000000275_S0000071 SO THIS PATIENT WAS NOT DIGESTING FATS IN HIS BOWEL AT ALL
YOU0000000275_S0000081 NOW INTERESTING KLEBSIELLA CAN BE A COMMENSAL NOW BY COMMENSAL WHAT I MEAN IS THINGS THAT NORMALLY RESIDE IN THE GUT AND DON'T CAUSE HARM
YOU0000000275_S0000089 SO I TELL THEM THIS I SAY I'M YOUR PERSONAL DETECTIVE AND I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR TRIGGERS THAT CAUSE YOUR DISEASE
YOU0000000275_S0000109 ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE CAN BE CAUSED BY DYSREGULATION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO COMMENSAL ORGANISMS
YOU0000000275_S0000117 OK NOW JUST A BIT ABOUT THIS IS GOING TO GET A LITTLE DEEP BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
YOU0000000275_S0000126 YOU SEE IN THIS PICTURE YOU BASICALLY HAVE ALL THE GREEN T-REG CELLS T-REG CELLS ARE GOOD GUYS THEY'RE LIKE THE POLICEMAN IN THE GUT AND IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THEY'RE SAYING HEY GUYS CALM DOWN DON'T OVERREACT
YOU0000000275_S0000146 SHE CRAVES SWEETS
YOU0000000275_S0000154 SO I ALSO MENTION THAT BECAUSE GUT AND BRAIN I COULD DO A WHOLE TWO HOURS ON GUT AND BRAIN AND THE CONNECTION
YOU0000000275_S0000162 SHE'S MARRIED WITH TWO CHILDREN
YOU0000000275_S0000171 YEAST IMBALANCE IS NOT A BAD THING
YOU0000000275_S0000180 BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT YEAST CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FIND AND IT'S NOT OFTEN IN THE COLON IT'S ACTUALLY MORE LIKELY TO BE IN THE SMALL BOWEL
YOU0000000275_S0000192 AND THEY CAN BECOME PRETTY NASTY THEY CAN COLONIZE VAGINAL FOR WOMEN
YOU0000000275_S0000205 SO THIS ALL CONNECTS
YOU0000000275_S0000226 SO HOW COMMON ARE ALL OF THESE THINGS RIGHT
YOU0000000275_S0000240 MOLD IS BY NATURE IMMUNO-SUPPRESSIVE
YOU0000000275_S0000250 YOU CAN BREW IN YOUR GUT
YOU0000000275_S0000257 PREVOTELLA AND YES YEAST
YOU0000000275_S0000266 HE HAS SACCHAROMYCES SPECIES IN THE GUT THEY WERE BREWING HERE'S THE DIAGRAM
YOU0000000275_S0000273 DON'T BE LIKE OH THAT'S JUST A BENIGN THING I GIVE THAT IN THE CLINIC
YOU0000000275_S0000281 SO THIS IS THE CASE STUDY I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT FASCINATING GOOGLE IT READ IT IF YOU GET A CHANCE IT'S JUST AMAZING BECAUSE IT'S VERY VERY REAL
YOU0000000275_S0000290 CHECK FOR YEAST OR THESE BREWERS IN THE GUT
YOU0000000275_S0000296 ONE OF THE EPIDEMICS OF OUR TIME AND I THINK ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGING CASES TO TREAT
YOU0000000275_S0000308 AND THE REASON I BROUGHT IT UP IS BECAUSE I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT POOP
YOU0000000275_S0000316 THE PROBLEM FOR ME RIGHT NOW IS HOW DO YOU FIND A GOOD DONOR
YOU0000000283_S0000009 PRESS SAVE AND AS IF BY MAGIC IT WIRELESSLY SYNCS OVER AND IS SAT THERE ON MY COMPUTER READY TO GO
YOU0000000283_S0000027 ALTERNATIVELY YOU CAN GO SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT AND USE A FITNESS TRACKING WATCH I'VE GOT THE GARMIN FENIX WHICH HAS GOT LOADS OF ADVANCED STUFF AS WELL
YOU0000000283_S0000046 SWIPE AGAIN AND I'VE GOT A HEART RATE AND ALSO A GRAPH
YOU0000000283_S0000096 SEE WHO'S GOT THE MOST FLOW AND HOW YOU CAN IMPROVE THAT
YOU0000000291_S0000012 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THREE COMPONENTS OUR OVERARCHING APP COMPONENT
YOU0000000291_S0000017 LET'S QUICKLY GO OVER THE FLOW OF DATA WE'LL NEED TO ESTABLISH
YOU0000000291_S0000022 WE'LL NEED TO KNOW WHEN A NODE IS CLICKED AND UPDATE THE INSPECTOR ACCORDINGLY
YOU0000000291_S0000027 INSIDE OUR INSPECTOR COMPONENT
YOU0000000291_S0000033 WE DON'T NEED APPLICATION ROUTING AND WE'LL JUST USE PLAIN CSS FOR OUR STYLING
YOU0000000291_S0000043 WE CAN NOW SEE
YOU0000000291_S0000050 THEN
YOU0000000291_S0000060 WE DON'T WANT TO JUST HARDCODE THIS DATA INSIDE OUR DIAGRAM COMPONENT
YOU0000000291_S0000066 LET'S DO THIS NOW
YOU0000000291_S0000074 FINALLY
YOU0000000291_S0000081 SINCE OUR DIAGRAM HAS A BUNCH OF NODES IN IT NOW
YOU0000000291_S0000088 NOW LET'S MAKE THE INSPECTOR
YOU0000000291_S0000096 CALLED NODECLICKED
YOU0000000291_S0000106 SO NOW OUR DIAGRAM COMPONENT EMITS AN EVENT WHENEVER THE SELECTION CHANGES
YOU0000000291_S0000112 NOW IN APP COMPONENT
YOU0000000291_S0000117 SINCE THIS FUNCTION IS BEING CALLED WHEN OUR NODECLICKED EVENT IS EMITTED TO APP COMPONENT FROM DIAGRAM COMPONENT
YOU0000000291_S0000124 WE'LL THEN DEFINE THIS PROPERTY IN OUR INSPECTOR COMPONENT AS AN ANGULAR INPUT PROPERTY
YOU0000000291_S0000130 WE'LL USE ANGULAR INTERPOLATION TO SHOW THE NAME OF OUR CURRENTLY SELECTED NODE
YOU0000000291_S0000138 AS WE DID FOR THE DIAGRAM COMPONENT'S MODEL PROPERTY
YOU0000000291_S0000148 IF THE PASSED NODE IS NULL
YOU0000000291_S0000159 ON EACH OF THESE INPUT ELEMENTS
YOU0000000291_S0000165 THE INSPECTOR DOES NOT APPEAR
YOU0000000291_S0000172 WHICH WE MUST NOW DEFINE IN OUR INSPECTOR COMPONENT CLASS
YOU0000000291_S0000179 THEN EITHER NAME OR PARENT FOR THE DATA PROPERTY TO UPDATE
YOU0000000291_S0000191 IF I CHANGE HIS NAME
YOU0000000291_S0000196 SAUL BECOMES AL'S SUBORDINATE
YOU0000000291_S0000202 SIGN UP FOR AN UNLIMITED FREE TRIAL AND YOU'LL GET THIRTY DAYS OF DEVELOPER-TO-DEVELOPER SUPPORT FOR FREE
YOU0000000299_S0000011 AND SO THIS IS AN INTERACTION THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD AND IT PERFORMS REALLY WELL FOR YOU
YOU0000000299_S0000016 BUT IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE SCREEN
YOU0000000299_S0000021 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
YOU0000000299_S0000027 AND WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB FOR THOSE USERS
YOU0000000299_S0000032 ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY IS BASICALLY SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE THAT MAKES IT EASIER FOR SOMEONE WITH A DISABILITY TO USE THE INTERNET
YOU0000000299_S0000037 AND MOTOR-IMPAIRED USERS
YOU0000000299_S0000043 AND MOST BLIND USERS WHO USE A SCREEN READER
YOU0000000299_S0000050 AND SO THAT'S THE SECOND TYPE OF USER
YOU0000000299_S0000055 I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THESE THREE GROUPS OF USERS HAVE SOMETHING BIG IN COMMON
YOU0000000299_S0000060 I ALREADY MENTIONED THAT WE SHOULD BE TESTING OUR APPS USING JUST THE KEYBOARD
YOU0000000299_S0000065 IT'S REALLY EASY TO USE BECAUSE IT'S A CHROME EXTENSION
YOU0000000299_S0000072 SO HOW DOES CHROMEVOX WORK
YOU0000000299_S0000079 ENTER YOUR NAME EDIT TEXT
YOU0000000299_S0000087 LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE GET THERE
YOU0000000299_S0000092 A SYSTEMATIC STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH TO TESTING AND BUILDING FOR ACCESSIBILITY
YOU0000000299_S0000097 WHICH I'M GOING TO DO RIGHT NOW
YOU0000000299_S0000103 IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR PAGE LOOKS LIKE THEY SEE ONLY THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE PAGE
YOU0000000299_S0000108 THEY CAN'T SEE WHAT THE PAGE LOOKS LIKE AND THEY'RE ONLY SEEING THE DOM
YOU0000000299_S0000114 NAV TO GROUP ALL YOUR NAVIGATION ELEMENTS TOGETHER
YOU0000000299_S0000119 SO I SEE THIS A LOT WHERE YOU'LL HAVE A DROP-DOWN MENU BUTTON SOMEWHERE IN THE DOM
YOU0000000299_S0000125 AND THEN THIS LAST POINT IS PRETTY BASIC BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT AGAIN
YOU0000000299_S0000131 THE RAIN IN SPAIN STAYS MAINLY IN THE PLAIN
YOU0000000299_S0000141 THE DOM UNDERNEATH THE PAGE HAS THESE WORDS ALL OVER THE PLACE
YOU0000000299_S0000147 SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR DOM MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING A WEB APP
YOU0000000299_S0000152 I USE THE TERMS DIV SOUP AND SPAN SALAD TO DESCRIBE APPS THAT ARE BUILT LIKE THIS
YOU0000000299_S0000157 FIRST
YOU0000000299_S0000162 SO THEY'RE JUST NOT GOING TO SPEAK IT AS INTERACTIVE AT ALL
YOU0000000299_S0000168 IF THAT'S NOT FOCUSABLE THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEND THE KEYBOARD EVENTS DO IT
YOU0000000299_S0000174 SCREEN READERS KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO IDENTIFY THEM
YOU0000000299_S0000183 CLICK ON THIS BUTTON ARTICLE
YOU0000000299_S0000191 YOU WANT TO CHANGE THIS DIV INTO A BUTTON
YOU0000000299_S0000198 RIGHT THIS IS GREAT CHROMEVOX SAID SEND BUTTON
YOU0000000299_S0000205 LABELING IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT NOW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONTROLS
YOU0000000299_S0000211 NOT JUST SOME OF THEM ALL OF YOUR IMAGES
YOU0000000299_S0000216 THE FINAL NAMES FOR SOME OF THE IMAGES THAT I SEE EVERY DAY ARE REALLY REALLY LONG STRINGS OF CHARACTERS
YOU0000000299_S0000221 AND SO THERE'S TWO KINDS OF ALT TEXTS THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE
YOU0000000299_S0000226 BLANK ALT TEXT TELLS THE SCREEN READER NOT TO TRY TO READ THE FILE NAME JUST SKIP THE IMAGE ENTIRELY IT'S NOT NECESSARY
YOU0000000299_S0000234 AND WE ALSO HAVE AN IMAGE JUST FOR FUN
YOU0000000299_S0000245 SO YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT NAVIGATING AROUND A PAGE THAT IS FULL OF UNLABELED FIELD AND IMAGES WILL GET REALLY TEDIOUS FOR A USER
YOU0000000299_S0000253 AND YOU'LL SEE AGAIN VISUALLY THAT NOTHING CHANGED CSS IS STILL STYLING THINGS CORRECTLY
YOU0000000299_S0000266 BASICALLY YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE MANAGING FOCUS
YOU0000000299_S0000272 SO YOU CAN REALLY HELP THESE USERS OUT BY MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHERE FOCUS IS AND BY MANAGING IT APPROPRIATELY
YOU0000000299_S0000279 CAN PRESS TAB TO MOVE LINEARLY UP AND DOWN THE DOM
YOU0000000299_S0000285 YOU CAN REALLY MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR THEM BY PUTTING FOCUS INTO APPROPRIATE PLACES AS THE USER IS PERFORMING A TASK AND WHEN THE USER IS DONE WITH A CERTAIN TASK
YOU0000000299_S0000291 IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF EDITING SOMETHING AND THE FOCUS IS DROPPED ON THE FLOOR
YOU0000000299_S0000297 AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IF YOU CLICK ON IT
YOU0000000299_S0000308 BUT LET'S SEE WHAT CHROMEVOX DOES
YOU0000000299_S0000315 FOCUS IS STILL ON THE BUTTON
YOU0000000299_S0000321 LIKE MAYBE THEY'RE A KEYBOARD-ONLY USER WHO CAN SEE THE SCREEN
YOU0000000299_S0000327 FOCUS JUST GETS DROPPED ON THE FLOOR
YOU0000000299_S0000338 THEN I'M ALSO GOING TO BE A NICE PERSON AND I'M GOING TO SET FOCUS BACK ON THE BUTTON WHEN THE DIALOG CLOSES
YOU0000000299_S0000347 AND EVEN BETTER A USER WHO CAN SEE THE SCREEN AND IS MAY BE ONLY USING THE KEYBOARD
YOU0000000299_S0000355 IS KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
YOU0000000299_S0000360 NAVIGATION SHORTCUTS JUMP BETWEEN MAJOR INTERACTIVE AREAS
YOU0000000299_S0000369 ACTION SHORTCUTS BASICALLY JUST SIMPLIFY A USER'S WORKFLOW
YOU0000000299_S0000375 AND EVEN IF THEY ARE DOCUMENTED NOT ALL USERS ARE GOING TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
YOU0000000299_S0000380 SO KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS ARE GREAT BUT THEY DON'T SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS
YOU0000000299_S0000388 AND TRY TO AVOID DIV SOUP AND SPAN SALAD
YOU0000000299_S0000393 NEXT YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT KEYBOARD NAVIGATION
YOU0000000299_S0000399 WHEN YOU GET KEYBOARD NAVIGATION WORKING
YOU0000000299_S0000408 IN MANY CASES YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH DIV SOUP
YOU0000000299_S0000413 AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT KEYBOARD SUPPORT
YOU0000000299_S0000418 SO ADDING ARIA ATTRIBUTES GIVES SCREEN READERS A HINT AS TO WHAT YOUR CUSTOM CONTROLS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SO THEY CAN DO A BETTER JOB INTERPRETING THEM TO THE USER
YOU0000000299_S0000423 THE ACTUAL CODE FOR IT WOULD NOT EVEN FIT ON THIS PAGE
YOU0000000299_S0000428 SO I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH HOW WE IMPROVED IT
YOU0000000299_S0000433 AND THE SECOND DIV IS THE DROP-DOWN
YOU0000000299_S0000438 REMEMBER WHEN I SAID THAT DIVS AND SPANS AREN'T KEYBOARD FOCUSABLE
YOU0000000299_S0000443 IT ADDS THAT DIV INTO THE TAB ORDER
YOU0000000299_S0000449 A USER WON'T BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH THEM
YOU0000000299_S0000456 THIS CAN BE A NATIVE CONTROL AS SIMPLE AS A BUTTON OR A SELECT BOX
YOU0000000299_S0000461 THEY KNOW TO PRESS THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE UP AND DOWN IN A SELECT BOX
YOU0000000299_S0000469 WITH RETURN ON REPLY KEY DOWN AND CHECKING FOR KEY CODES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YOU0000000299_S0000475 TO A SIGHTED USER YOU HOVER OVER IT
YOU0000000299_S0000483 SO ENTER AND SPACE MIMIC THE BEHAVIOR OF A REGULAR BUTTON
YOU0000000299_S0000489 WHEN YOU HOVER OVER THE BUTTON AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AGAIN
YOU0000000299_S0000499 LIKE WE DID ON THE OK BUTTON IN THE DIALOG EXAMPLE
YOU0000000299_S0000504 WE ALSO ADDED ESCAPE AS A KEYBOARD SHORTCUT
YOU0000000299_S0000509 SO I'LL SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS WORKS
YOU0000000299_S0000515 AND YOU CAN SEE RIGHT AWAY THE DIALOG OPENED
YOU0000000299_S0000524 AND AS I POINTED OUT EARLIER SCREEN READERS HAVE REAL DIFFICULTY IDENTIFYING WHAT A PILE OF DIVS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
YOU0000000299_S0000530 YOU STILL NEED TO ADD THAT STUFF
YOU0000000299_S0000535 THE ROLE ATTRIBUTE IS STATIC
YOU0000000299_S0000542 YOU CAN USE ARIA THERE TOO
YOU0000000299_S0000548 YOU CAN USE THEM TOGETHER WITH THE NEW H T M L FIVE SEMANTIC TAGS TO CREATE A REALLY RICH USER EXPERIENCE
YOU0000000299_S0000553 THESE ARE BOTH DYNAMIC
YOU0000000299_S0000559 AND AS THIS CHECKBOX GETS CHECKED AND UNCHECKED
YOU0000000299_S0000569 AND IF YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION
YOU0000000299_S0000577 THINGS GET CONFUSING REALLY FAST
YOU0000000299_S0000583 SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO SPECIFY IS THAT THIS ELEMENT IS A BUTTON
YOU0000000299_S0000591 SO WE'RE GOING TO ADD ROLE EQUALS DIALOG
YOU0000000299_S0000596 LET'S TRY OUT THE ADD TO CIRCLES WIDGET WITH CHROMEVOX
YOU0000000299_S0000612 BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE INTERACTED WITH THIS STUFF BEFORE THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT
YOU0000000299_S0000619 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE STRUCTURING YOUR DOM IN A SENSIBLE WAY
YOU0000000299_S0000625 YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR APP CAN BE USED ENTIRELY WITH THE KEYBOARD
YOU0000000299_S0000630 SO NOW I'M GOING TO LIST SOME TOOLS AND RESOURCES THAT CAN HELP YOU GET YOUR APP TO BEING A MORE ACCESSIBLE EXPERIENCE
YOU0000000299_S0000638 AS A DEVELOPER IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT TO TEST YOUR APP USING JUST THE KEYBOARD
YOU0000000299_S0000644 IT'S DEFINITELY POSSIBLE TO DELIVER A DYNAMIC ACCESSIBLE EXPERIENCE THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD TO SIGHTED USERS
YOU0000000299_S0000649 YOU CAN PROBABLY FIGURE OUT SOME THINGS TO FIX THAT CAN MAKE THE EXPERIENCE A LOT BETTER
YOU0000000299_S0000654 TO AN APP THAT WORKS WELL FOR EVERYBODY
YOU0000000307_S0000013 SO IF YOU OPEN THE SESSION YOU HAVE A LINK TO DORY
YOU0000000307_S0000023 AND LATER WE HAVE A SECTION FOR OUR FUTURE WORK
YOU0000000307_S0000035 ENIAC TO CALCULATE PI

YOU0000000315_S0002231 NOW IT IS GROON'S TURN
YOU0000000315_S0002246 HE'S DOING A LOT OF MATH
YOU0000000315_S0002255 WANT TO GET INVOLVED
YOU0000000315_S0002280 WITH THE HORN
YOU0000000315_S0002323 SO I GOT TWO DAGGERS IN MY HANDS AND THEY SPIN AROUND IN MY HAND
YOU0000000315_S0002351 ALL RIGHT SO
YOU0000000315_S0002377 BUT IT'S NOT AS IMPACTFUL AS YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FOR THE FORCE
YOU0000000315_S0002388 THOSE WERE HIGH
YOU0000000315_S0002413 INSTEAD OF SLEEPING THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE HIM TO JUST
YOU0000000315_S0002449 YOU SAID QUADRUPLE IT'S NOT QUADRUPLE

YOU0000000315_S0002638 NO MINUS FIVE

YOU0000000315_S0002733 THAT'S A SEVENTEEN
YOU0000000315_S0002763 AS YOU DROP CRAVEN EDGE
YOU0000000315_S0002769 A WISDOM SAVING THROW
YOU0000000315_S0002784 HE STOPS FOR A SECOND
YOU0000000315_S0002793 GROG
YOU0000000315_S0002803 AND A BUNCH OF HIS WOUNDS
YOU0000000315_S0002814 YOU NEED NOT THE STRENGTH OF VASSELHEIM TO AID YOU
YOU0000000315_S0002819 I KNOW OF TWO
YOU0000000315_S0002824 THESE TITANSTONE KNUCKLES WERE A SYMBOL OF POWER AND LEADERSHIP FOR GENERATIONS HERE IN VASSELHEIM UNTIL THE LAST KNOWN KEEPER WAS SLAIN TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO
YOU0000000315_S0002829 THIS CHAMPION'S TOMB HAS SINCE COME TO RUIN
YOU0000000315_S0002834 YOU'VE FOUND YOUR STRENGTH
YOU0000000315_S0002840 VAX
YOU0000000315_S0002878 WE'LL GO AHEAD AND LEAVE TODAY'S
YOU0000000323_S0000006 SHE HAS TAUGHT NUMEROUS WORKSHOPS AND SHORT COURSES ON CRIME SCENE EVIDENCE COLLECTION AND TRACE EVIDENCE ANALYSIS
YOU0000000323_S0000014 AND FEATHER IDENTIFICATION
YOU0000000323_S0000021 WE WILL ANSWER ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS INDIVIDUALLY IN THE COMING DAYS
YOU0000000323_S0000026 TODAY I AM GOING TO SHARE A FEW METHODS THAT I FIND USEFUL TO SECTION HAIRS AND FIBERS TO BETTER OBSERVE THEIR CROSS-SECTIONAL SHAPE AND INTERNAL STRUCTURES
YOU0000000323_S0000035 AN ULTRAMICROTOME FOR ULTRATHIN SECTIONS
YOU0000000323_S0000040 GLASS MICROSCOPE SLIDES
YOU0000000323_S0000048 SO IT WILL BE EASIER TO SEPARATE LATER
YOU0000000323_S0000055 HERE I HAVE PLACED SEVERAL FIBERS FROM A SAMPLE OF CARPETING ON TOP OF ONE SHEET OF POLYETHYLENE THAT WAS CUT TO FIT WITHIN THE WIDTH OF A SLIDE
YOU0000000323_S0000065 AND THEN I'LL USE A SINGLE-EDGED RAZOR BLADE TO SLICE SECTIONS
YOU0000000323_S0000072 AND MOST LABS WILL HAVE THESE SUPPLIES ON HAND
YOU0000000323_S0000078 CREATING A LOOP
YOU0000000323_S0000086 YOU WANT TO PULL THE MATERIAL SLOWLY THROUGH THE HOLE
YOU0000000323_S0000105 YOU CAN TURN THE PLATE OVER AND CAREFULLY SLICE OFF THE REMAINING LOOP OF FIBERS
YOU0000000323_S0000116 THE BENEFITS OF USING CROSS-SECTION PLATES ARE THAT ONCE YOU HAVE CUT THE SECTIONS
YOU0000000323_S0000123 SO IT MAY TAKE SOME PRACTICING TO BECOME PROFICIENT AT SECTIONING WITH THIS METHOD
YOU0000000323_S0000129 THE SAMPLE HAS TO BE ORIENTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE CUTTING BLADE
YOU0000000323_S0000142 THE NEXT SECTIONING METHOD I WANT TO DISCUSS IS ONE WHERE YOU OPTICALLY SECTION A MATERIAL INSTEAD OF PHYSICALLY CUTTING ACROSS ITS LENGTH
YOU0000000323_S0000154 BUT THE EMBEDDING METHODS DIFFER IN HOW THE SAMPLES MAY BE PACKED
YOU0000000323_S0000161 SUCH AS DO YOU NEED PRECISE MEASUREMENTS OR JUST INFORMATION ON THE SIZE RANGE AND SAMPLE SHAPE
YOU0000000323_S0000167 AND ALL OF THOSE OUT THERE WHO JOINED US AND TUNED IN
YOU0000000331_S0000070 AND I BELIEVE THAT I CAN CALL MIGHT DESKTOPS
YOU0000000331_S0000100 SO HERE ALL THE CHANNELS PASO WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS YOU WOULD ACTUALLY GO HERE
YOU0000000331_S0000126 STUDIO ONE AFFECT STUDIO ONE SETTINGS IF I WAS TO DELETE THIS STUDIO ONE SETTINGS FILE
YOU0000000331_S0000169 ALL MY FADERS OR I CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND SELECTOR FEW DIFFERENT FADERS AND THEN RESET THEM
YOU0000000331_S0000237 AND THEN HAVEN'T BEEN NO
YOU0000000339_S0000005 ONCE THE PRINTER IS OFF
YOU0000000339_S0000011 SLIDE OUT THE INPUT TRAY
YOU0000000339_S0000016 TRY PRINTING A PAGE DIRECTLY FROM THE PRINTER'S CONTROL PANEL TO SEE IF THE ISSUE IS RESOLVED
YOU0000000339_S0000021 THEN
YOU0000000339_S0000026 IF THE PAGE DOES NOT PRINT
YOU0000000339_S0000031 LEVEL AND HARD
YOU0000000339_S0000036 TOUCH THE SETTINGS ICON
YOU0000000339_S0000041 IF THE PAGE PRINTS SUCCESSFULLY
YOU0000000339_S0000046 IN THIS STEP
YOU0000000339_S0000051 IF YOU SEE ANY JAMMED PAPER IN THE PAPER TRAY
YOU0000000339_S0000056 SLIDE IN THE INPUT TRAY
YOU0000000339_S0000061 RETURN TO THE FRONT OF THE PRINTER
YOU0000000339_S0000066 USE A FLASHLIGHT TO THOROUGHLY SEARCH THE AREA TO FIND ANY SMALL SCRAPS OF PAPER
YOU0000000339_S0000071 GRASP THE HANDLE AND PULL THE CLEANOUT DOOR UP AND OUT TO REMOVE IT FROM THE PRINTER
YOU0000000339_S0000076 IF ANY TORN PIECES OF PAPER REMAIN INSIDE THE PRINTER
YOU0000000339_S0000081 USE THE OTHER HAND TO REMOVE ANY JAMMED OR TORN PIECES OF PAPER FROM THE DUPLEXER AREA
YOU0000000339_S0000086 NOW EXAMINE THE CLEANOUT DOOR
YOU0000000339_S0000093 TO DO THIS
YOU0000000339_S0000098 SLIDE OUT THE PAPER INPUT TRAY
YOU0000000339_S0000103 USE A FLASHLIGHT TO THOROUGHLY SEARCH THE AREA TO FIND ANY SCRAPS OF PAPER
YOU0000000339_S0000108 MAKE SURE THE SCANNER LID IS SECURE WHILE ROTATING
YOU0000000339_S0000113 TURN TO THE BACK
YOU0000000339_S0000118 LOAD PAPER INTO THE INPUT TRAY UNTIL IT STOPS
YOU0000000339_S0000123 TOUCH THE SETTINGS ICON
YOU0000000339_S0000128 IF THE PAGE PRINTS SUCCESSFULLY THE ISSUE IS RESOLVED
YOU0000000339_S0000133 THE PRINTER MUST BE ON FOR THIS STEP TO WORK
YOU0000000339_S0000139 IF IT DOES
YOU0000000339_S0000144 DISCONNECT THE OTHER END OF THE POWER CORD FROM ITS POWER SOURCE
YOU0000000339_S0000149 CHECK THE ROLLERS AND WHEELS FOR ANY TORN PIECES OF PAPER THAT MIGHT REMAIN INSIDE THE PRINTER
YOU0000000339_S0000154 USING A FLASHLIGHT
YOU0000000339_S0000159 REMOVE ANY OBSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE FOUND
YOU0000000339_S0000164 RECONNECT THE OTHER END OF THE POWER CORD INTO ITS POWER SOURCE
YOU0000000339_S0000170 SLIDE THE PAPER WIDTH GUIDES INWARD UNTIL THEY STOP AT THE EDGE OF THE PAPER DO NOT PUSH THE GUIDES IN SO TIGHTLY THAT THEY START TO BEND THE PAPER
YOU0000000339_S0000175 THIS ICON LOOKS LIKE A SMALL WRENCH
YOU0000000339_S0000180 IF YOU'RE USING A USB CABLE RECONNECT IT TO THE PRINTER AND RESUME PRINTING AS NORMAL
YOU0000000339_S0000185 JAMS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR
YOU0000000339_S0000190 TURN TO THE BACK
YOU0000000339_S0000195 MAKE SURE THE SCANNER LID IS SECURE WHILE ROTATING
YOU0000000339_S0000201 USE BOTH HANDS AND GENTLY ROTATE THE PRINTER TO ITS ORIGINAL UPRIGHT POSITION
YOU0000000339_S0000207 SLIDE OUT THE INPUT TRAY
YOU0000000339_S0000213 ON THE PRINTER'S CONTROL PANEL
YOU0000000339_S0000218 TOUCH PRINTER STATUS REPORT
YOU0000000339_S0000223 THE PAPER TRAY MIGHT BE WARPED AND NEED TO BE REPLACED
YOU0000000339_S0000228 THE PAPER TRAY IS WARPED IF THERE ARE GAPS BETWEEN THE STRAIGHT OBJECT AND THE TRAY
YOU0000000339_S0000234 LOAD PAPER INTO THE INPUT TRAY UNTIL IT STOPS
YOU0000000339_S0000239 PAPER FIBER AND OTHER DEBRIS
YOU0000000339_S0000244 SLIDE OUT THE INPUT TRAY AND REMOVE THE PAPER
YOU0000000339_S0000251 GRASP THE HANDLE AND PULL THE CLEANOUT DOOR UP AND OUT TO REMOVE IT FROM THE PRINTER AND SET IT ASIDE
YOU0000000339_S0000256 MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE ANY BUILDUP OR DEBRIS FROM THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THE ROLLERS
YOU0000000339_S0000262 OR ARE NOT SPRINGY WHEN YOU PUSH ON THEM
YOU0000000339_S0000267 CLOSE THE CARTRIDGE ACCESS DOOR
YOU0000000339_S0000274 SLIDE THE PAPER WIDTH GUIDES INWARD UNTIL THEY STOP AT THE EDGE OF THE PAPER DO NOT PUSH THE GUIDES IN SO TIGHTLY THAT THEY START TO BEND THE PAPER
YOU0000000339_S0000279 THIS ICON LOOKS LIKE A SMALL WRENCH
YOU0000000339_S0000284 IF YOU'RE USING A USB CABLE RECONNECT IT TO THE PRINTER AND RESUME PRINTING AS NORMAL
YOU0000000339_S0000289 TURN TO THE BACK
YOU0000000339_S0000294 IT IS IMPORTANT TO WAIT THE FULL FIFTEEN SECONDS TO ALLOW THE PRINT MECHANISM TO RESET
YOU0000000339_S0000299 IF THE PRINTER DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY TURN ON
YOU0000000339_S0000304 THIS ICON LOOKS LIKE A SMALL WRENCH
YOU0000000339_S0000309 IF YOU'RE USING A USB CABLE RECONNECT IT TO THE PRINTER AND RESUME PRINTING AS NORMAL
YOU0000000347_S0000011 AND ALL OF THIS IS UP TO YOU TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU LIKE BEST
YOU0000000347_S0000019 AND THAT IS IT
YOU0000000355_S0000016 FOR THE SECURITY CHECKING
YOU0000000355_S0000036 AND SHE TOOK ME HER TO OUR OFFICE ROOM
YOU0000000355_S0000091 I'M I'M I'M WORKING ON KITCHEN I'M COOKING FOOD AND SHE SAID LIKE
YOU0000000355_S0000122 I TOLD WHAT THE TRUTH IS AND I TOLD EVERYTHING WHAT I HAVE BECAUSE
YOU0000000355_S0000136 BEST WISH ALL THE PEOPLE WORKING ON MCDONALD BEST OF LUCK FOR YOUR UPCOMING INTERVIEW
YOU0000000363_S0000008 AND SOME YOU KNOW PENS AND HIGHLIGHTERS OR WHATEVER YOU NEED
YOU0000000363_S0000013 THEN TAKE THAT OUTLINE AND DIVIDE IT INTO MANAGEABLE SECTIONS
YOU0000000363_S0000019 AND THEN DEFENSES TO INTENTIONAL TORTS
YOU0000000363_S0000026 AND YOU'LL START TO REALLY BUILD YOUR CONFIDENCE AND YOUR SKILLS AS YOU MEMORIZE
YOU0000000363_S0000032 AND THEN
YOU0000000363_S0000037 OKAY SO BATTERY ASSAULT TRESPASS AND THEN ALL THE ELEMENTS
YOU0000000363_S0000043 YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT SO
YOU0000000363_S0000050 GREAT
YOU0000000363_S0000057 IF YOU'RE AN AUDITORY LEARNER SO IF YOU LEARN BETTER FROM LECTURE AND HEARING
YOU0000000363_S0000064 IF YOU'RE AN AUDITORY LEARNER MNEMONICS AND RHYMES WILL BE VERY HELPFUL TO YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA STICK IN YOUR HEAD
YOU0000000363_S0000072 OR YOU MIGHT JUST USE THE SAME TECHNIQUE ALL THE TIME I'VE MEMORIZED EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE BY JUST YOU KNOW HAVING MY OUTLINE COVERING IT UP AND SEEING WHAT I CAN REWRITE
YOU0000000363_S0000078 GET UP WALK AROUND EAT A SNACK CALL A FRIEND WHATEVER
YOU0000000363_S0000083 THEN WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH IT
YOU0000000363_S0000088 AND YOU'RE STILL GOING TO STRUGGLE AT THIS POINT
YOU0000000363_S0000094 THEN AT NIGHT MAKE SURE YOU GET A FULL NIGHT OF SLEEP WHATEVER YOU NEED
YOU0000000363_S0000100 YOU WILL FIND THAT IT COMES MUCH EASIER AFTER A FULL NIGHT OF SLEEP
YOU0000000363_S0000105 ANOTHER KEY THING TO REMEMBER IS YOU'RE NOT DONE AT THAT POINT
YOU0000000363_S0000114 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I WOULD LEARN TORTS IN WEEK ONE
YOU0000000363_S0000119 WEEK THREE I'D PROBABLY GO THROUGH IT ABOUT TWO TIMES AGAIN
YOU0000000363_S0000127 IT'S GONNA TAKE YOU SIGNIFICANTLY LESS TIME
YOU0000000363_S0000134 THE BAR EXAM CAN BE COMPLETELY OVERWHELMING THERE ARE SO MUCH TO LEARN
YOU0000000363_S0000139 THE BAR EXAM DOES NOT TEST EVERYTHING EQUALLY
YOU0000000363_S0000146 VERSUS SOMETHING LIKE DEFAMATION
YOU0000000371_S0000004 TO HELP YOU QUICKLY IMPROVE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY I'VE SUMMARIZED THE KEY POINTS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN SHOOTING PORTRAITS AND I EXPLAIN HOW TO AVOID THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS
YOU0000000371_S0000009 OFTEN FOR MANY PHOTOGRAPHERS BACKGROUNDS SEEM TO BE SOMEWHAT OF AN AFTERTHOUGHT WHEN IN FACT THEY SHOULD BE SOMETHING YOU CONSIDER FROM THE VERY START OF YOUR SHOOT
YOU0000000371_S0000016 IN THE LEFT EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH THE PHOTOGRAPHER HAS CREATED GOOD LIGHTING
YOU0000000371_S0000022 HOWEVER AMIDST ALL THE CHAOS DON'T FORGET TO STOP AND LOOK AT THE FINER DETAILS
YOU0000000371_S0000027 TAKING A FEW MINUTES DURING THE SHOOT CAN SAVE YOU HOURS IN PHOTOSHOP AFTERWARDS
YOU0000000371_S0000033 HANDS CAN VERY EASILY LOOK VERY AWKWARD IN AN IMAGE
YOU0000000371_S0000039 BLACK ON BLACK OR WHITE ON WHITE CAN RESULT IN VERY STRIKING PORTRAIT IMAGES WHEN DONE CORRECTLY HOWEVER THIS TECHNIQUE DOES REQUIRE CAREFUL CONTROL OF LIGHTING TO ENSURE THE SUBJECT IS CLEARLY SEPARATED FROM THE BACKGROUND
YOU0000000371_S0000044 RIM LIGHTS OR USING A SLIGHTLY LIGHTER BACKGROUND
YOU0000000371_S0000049 FOLLOWING ON FROM THE PREVIOUS POINT LIGHTING IS A KEY PART OF ANY IMAGE BUT WHAT WORKS FOR ONE IMAGE MAY NOT NECESSARILY WORK FOR ANYTHING ELSE
YOU0000000371_S0000054 LIGHTING ON HANDS WAS ANOTHER COMMON PROBLEM THAT I SAW THROUGHOUT THE CRITIQUE SHOW
YOU0000000371_S0000061 THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY WITH THE IMAGE AND IS IT CLEAR
YOU0000000371_S0000067 TO GIVE YOURSELF A GREATER CHANCE OF HOLDING THE VIEWERS ATTENTION IT REQUIRES A COMBINATION OF ALL THE AFOREMENTIONED TOPICS AS WELL AS GOOD COMPOSITION
YOU0000000371_S0000072 DON'T BE AFRAID TO MAKE SUBTLE TWEAKS AND CHANGES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SMOOTHING SHAPES AS I DEMONSTRATED ON A COUPLE OF MEMBERS IMAGES DURING THE CRITIQUES
YOU0000000371_S0000077 WHERE THE END RESULT OFTEN LOOKS TEXTURELESS AND PLASTIC-LIKE AND WE HAVE SEVERAL GREAT SKIN RETOUCHING CLASSES THAT DEMONSTRATE SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE METHODS THAT YOU CAN USE FOR PERFECT SKIN RETOUCHING IN OUR POST-PRODUCTION SECTION ON KARL TAYLOR EDUCATION
YOU0000000371_S0000082 IF YOU DID PLEASE GIVE US A THUMBS UP AND THANKS FOR WATCHING
YOU0000000379_S0000014 WHY DON'T YOU GUYS TELL THE AUDIENCE ABOUT YOURSELVES LIKE HOW YOU GUYS GOT STARTED
YOU0000000379_S0000038 AND SO WHAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN IS WE HAD TO HIRE AN ENTIRE DATA DIVISION
YOU0000000379_S0000050 AND YOU GUYS REALLY MADE A VERY SHREWD SMART MOVE AND PIVOT BY THE WAY
YOU0000000379_S0000101 AND IT WAS LIKE ON THAT SAME DAY WAS LIKE YOU KNOW OVER A MILLION IN REVENUE WITHIN A WEEK IT WAS LIKE ONE POINT FIVE
YOU0000000379_S0000120 BUT THE THING IS IT'S NOT GONNA GO AWAY
YOU0000000379_S0000133 SO WE WORK WITH COMPANIES THAT COME OUT OF THE GATE SAYING I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME AND I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS COULD HELP ME
YOU0000000379_S0000146 WHO WAS LOOKING FOR THEIR TRUE LIFETIME VALUE
YOU0000000379_S0000160 WE DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO SPEND A LOT MORE THAN THAT I THINK IT WAS WORTH LIKE SIXTY TWO DOLLARS LET'S SAY
YOU0000000379_S0000182 AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT VCS AND THEY'RE SENDING OUT THESE INVESTOR REPORTS
YOU0000000379_S0000188 AND GUESS WHAT THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK RIGHT
YOU0000000379_S0000195 SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT SPECIFIC USE CASES
YOU0000000379_S0000213 LIKE WE NEED SPECIFICITY ALL ABOUT DETAILS HERE
YOU0000000379_S0000232 IT LEADS YOU TO THE NEXT STEP WHICH IS WE NEED TO FIX OUR TRACKING
YOU0000000379_S0000241 ANOTHER PIECE OF ACTION WE CAN TAKE IS ONCE WE SEE THE DATA AND LET'S SAY IT IS TRACKING ACCURATELY RIGHT
YOU0000000379_S0000252 AUTOMATION
YOU0000000379_S0000269 IT'S ALSO COMPOUNDING BECAUSE NOW THAT TIME IS BEING SPENT WITH THOSE SAME INTELLIGENT PEOPLE ANALYZING THE DATA
YOU0000000379_S0000290 MAKING SURE THAT AS YOU'RE COLLECTING DATA IT'S ACCURATE AND IT'S USABLE EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING WITH IT NOW
YOU0000000379_S0000297 THAT MEANS YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO SET UP THIS AMAZING TOOL THAT IS FREE IN THE RIGHT WAY SO THEY CAN SERVE YOU LATER ON
YOU0000000379_S0000310 AND WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE PIVOTAL MISTAKES
YOU0000000379_S0000323 YOU WOULD JUST DO THAT RIGHT INSTEAD OF TRIALING AND ERRORING ALL ACROSS THE BOARD SO LIKE TO YOUR POINT

YOU0000000459_S0000178 HOWEVER DON'T LOOK FOR THE PODCAST TO COME OUT THE NEXT DAY LIKE GAME OF THRONES WAS ON SUNDAY
YOU0000000459_S0000217 IN ADDITION TO TEACHING ENGLISH AT MADISON COLLEGE

YOU0000000459_S0000273 SO WHAT DID YOU THINK OF IT
YOU0000000459_S0000285 I FOUND AN ARTICLE THAT POSTULATED H H HOLMES AND JACK THE RIPPER WERE ONE AND THE SAME
YOU0000000459_S0000294 AS IS OFTEN THE CASE HIS VICTIMS WERE MARGINALIZED BY SOCIETY
YOU0000000459_S0000302 SO IT SEEMS A LITTLE SURPRISING THAT THE HISTORY CHANNEL WOULD MAKE A WHOLE SERIES ON THIS TOPIC
YOU0000000459_S0000319 AMONG OTHERS
YOU0000000459_S0000336 YOU ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE SEEN HIS PHOTOGRAPHS
YOU0000000459_S0000369 ALRIGHT WELL
YOU0000000467_S0000004 LINK BUILDING WAS ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT WAS REALLY REALLY EASY TO DO AND EVERYBODY TALKED ABOUT IT THERE REALLY WASN'T A LOT OF RULES OR RESTRICTIONS RELATED TO LINK BUILDING
YOU0000000467_S0000019 AND THEY'RE INFERRING THAT VALUE BASED ON THE QUALITY OF THE SITE THAT IT'S COMING FROM
YOU0000000467_S0000028 OKAY SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IS GETTING GOOD HIGH QUALITY LINKS FROM OTHER WEBSITES RIGHT

YOU0000000467_S0000085 YES ABSOLUTELY THAT IS A HUGE PART OF BLACK HAT IT'S A SPAM TECHNIQUE THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT IT IS THAT TECHNIQUES THAT WORKED YEARS AGO ARE NOW CONSIDERED BLACK HAT AND IT SEEMS TO BE DIFFICULT FOR A LOT OF BUSINESSES AND EVEN SOME AGENCIES TO MAKE THE CHANGE THAT THEY NEED TO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT DOING THESE BLACK HAT TECHNIQUES
YOU0000000467_S0000093 TRYING TO USE SCARE TACTICS AND SAYING THAT YOUR WEBSITE IS NOT RANKING
YOU0000000467_S0000098 ANOTHER ONE IS BUYING LINKS
YOU0000000467_S0000108 IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK YOU'LL LOSE ALL OF YOUR RANKING AND THEN IT BECOMES A LOT HARDER TO DIG YOURSELF OUT OF THIS HOLE AND GET BACK TO THE RANKING THAT YOU WERE AT THAT YOU NEEDED TO BE AT

YOU0000000483_S0000316 HAVE DEEP KNOWLEDGE IN KUBERNETES RIGHT NOW
YOU0000000483_S0000334 FROM A SUPER HIGH LEVEL THAT'S TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GOING TO RUN MY CONTAINERS
YOU0000000483_S0000365 THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IS CREATE A DOCKER FILE RIGHT
YOU0000000483_S0000403 THAT SOUNDS MUCH EASIER
YOU0000000483_S0000435 AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND IN MY ABOUT PAGE LET'S ADD IN
YOU0000000483_S0000457 I NEED TO THIS IS WHEN I'M CREATING MY IMAGE
YOU0000000483_S0000474 LET ME GRAB THE ID
YOU0000000483_S0000485 HERE IS MY APP
YOU0000000483_S0000524 HE PUSHED THE CODE IT WENT THROUGH THE PIPELINE
YOU0000000483_S0000582 JUST LIKE WHAT YOU SAW IN BUILD
YOU0000000483_S0000647 WHAT IS THAT BUILD EIGHTEEN CODE FRESH
YOU0000000483_S0000681 CHARTS CAN BE PACKAGED UP
YOU0000000483_S0000742 FOR AZURE
YOU0000000483_S0000778 THAT'S ALL IT IS
YOU0000000483_S0000796 SO THERE IS NOTHING MORE FOR YOU TO DO
YOU0000000483_S0000827 IF YOU ALSO WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HELM CHARTS AND YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO WRITE YOUR OWN
YOU0000000483_S0000846 FINALLY
YOU0000000491_S0000011 TODAY I WANT TO SHOW YOU MY THREE WAYS ON HOW I UTILIZE THIS OFTEN FOR MY TAG DEPLOYMENTS SPEED UP MY WORKFLOW
YOU0000000491_S0000016 WELCOME BACK TO OUR DEMO SHOP
YOU0000000491_S0000022 BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT OBJECTS FOR DIFFERENT CONTAINERS
YOU0000000491_S0000027 ALL WE NEED TO DO IS WRITE A DOT AND THEN DATA LAYER
YOU0000000491_S0000032 AND WE CAN SEE
YOU0000000491_S0000039 BUT WHAT IF I ONLY WANTED TO USE THIS VARIABLE ONCE AND ONLY FOR THIS TAG
YOU0000000491_S0000045 YOU WOULD NEED TO PUT IN YOUR KEY FOR THE DATA LAYER INTO THE VARIABLE AND SO I'M GOING TO JUST WRITE DOT GET HERE
YOU0000000491_S0000051 AND I CAN PRESS ENTER
YOU0000000491_S0000056 AND ZERO AND NAME AND WE CAN SEE HERE WE GET THE NAME
YOU0000000491_S0000062 OUR TAG FIRES
YOU0000000491_S0000073 AS THIS WOULD ONLY BE EVALUATED ONCE ONCE THE PAGE LOADS
YOU0000000491_S0000081 WE NOW SEE THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE THE LAST VALUE THAT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN INTO THE DATA LAYER TO OUR DISPOSAL HERE WITHIN JAVASCRIPT
YOU0000000491_S0000088 NOW IN BETWEEN ONE TO DO AN EXTRACTION OF THE DATA SO WE WILL PULL OUR GTM ELEMENT HERE
YOU0000000491_S0000093 AND WE GET FIFTY BACK THIS IS WHAT WE WANTED
YOU0000000491_S0000099 WE SHOULD SEE IN OUR VARIABLES
YOU0000000491_S0000104 AND I WOULD LIKE TO INPUT OUR PRODUCT ID THIS TIME
YOU0000000491_S0000110 BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REUSE THIS VARIABLE IN OTHER TAGS THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT THIS INTO A VARIABLE AND ABSTRACT THAT THIS WAY
YOU0000000491_S0000115 LAST BUT NOT LEAST I OFTEN USE THIS WHEN I WOULD LIKE TO UTILIZE THE MATCHES CSS SELECTOR OPTION
YOU0000000491_S0000120 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WELL IF WE WOULD LIKE TO FIRE THIS TAG UPON OUR MENU CLICK
YOU0000000491_S0000126 AND REFRESH OUR PREVIEW AND DEBUG MODE
YOU0000000491_S0000134 AND THIS TIME
YOU0000000491_S0000140 OR BACK AGAIN
YOU0000000491_S0000147 WHICH WILL UNDERNEATH OPEN UP THE CONSOLE AS WELL
YOU0000000491_S0000155 WITHOUT QUOTATION MARKS WE CAN ENTER OUR CSS SELECTOR AND SEE IF IT MATCHES UP
YOU0000000491_S0000167 AND IT TURNS FALSE
YOU0000000491_S0000173 RELOAD THIS
YOU0000000491_S0000180 AND NOW CLICK ON OUR MENU AND WE SEE THE GA EVENT MENU CLICK HAS FIRED
YOU0000000491_S0000185 AND THE TAG FIRES
YOU0000000491_S0000191 HAPPY MEASURING
YOU0000000499_S0000017 OR MAYBE NOT SO OBVIOUS IT CAN ALSO JUST OUT RIGHT DELETE
YOU0000000499_S0000025 I NEED TO BE CLOSER
YOU0000000499_S0000042 YOU'LL SEE ALL OF THE LABELS THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED TO THIS PARTICULAR SHAREPOINT SITE
YOU0000000499_S0000047 I CAN ALSO DRAG AND DROP NEW CONTENT IN AND IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY GET THAT SAME RETENTION LABEL
YOU0000000499_S0000054 YOU CAN ALSO CLEAR THE LABEL AT THE FOLDER AND EVERYTHING WITHIN IT WILL HAVE THEIR LABEL CLEARED WHICH IS SOMETIMES A RETIREMENT
YOU0000000499_S0000059 WHEN YOU OPEN THAT ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS WITHIN IT WILL HAVE INHERITED THAT LABEL
YOU0000000499_S0000070 THE SETUP FOR THIS IS OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO BUILD YOUR CUSTOM SENSITIVE INFORMATION TYPE IN ADVANCE
YOU0000000499_S0000083 THIS IS WHY I HAD TO PRERECORD MY DEMOS THIS CAN TAKE UP TO SEVEN DAYS TO APPLY
YOU0000000499_S0000093 YOU SOMETIMES HAVE TO MAP THOSE UP
YOU0000000499_S0000106 SO HERE IS THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SITES WE HAVE PROVISIONED FOR THE EXECUTIVE TEAM
YOU0000000499_S0000119 YOU CAN SEE IN THE DOCUMENT LIBRARY THE EXECUTIVE LABEL HAS BEEN APPLIED HERE'S A SHAREPOINT LIST
YOU0000000499_S0000130 AND THIS IS ALL YOU DO CONTENT TYPE AND THEN WHATEVER THE CONTENT TYPE WAS
YOU0000000499_S0000154 YOU CAN ALSO GET MORE SOPHISTIC ATED MAYBE YOU HAD DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR A DIFFERENT POLICY SO YOU CAN HAVE A COMPOUND CONDITION IN THERE
YOU0000000499_S0000164 I'M DOING THIS JUST AGAINST SHAREPOINT SITES
YOU0000000499_S0000176 NOW YOU CAN DO THIS WITH THE LAST OPTION BUT THE KEY DIFFERENTIATER BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE LAST OPTION TAKES UP TO SEVEN DAYS TO APPLY
YOU0000000499_S0000189 BUT I'M GIVING YOU A BONUS
YOU0000000499_S0000200 OR YOU CAN DO IT IN AN AUTOMATED WAY WHICH I SHOWED YOU SEVEN WAYS TODAY THAT YOU COULD DO THAT THESE ARE NOT TO SCALE BY THE WAY IT'S JUST ME MAKING UP SIZES
YOU0000000499_S0000211 OKAY
YOU0000000509_S0000010 AND THEN I TAKE EVERYTHING THAT I LEARN BEING OUT IN THE COMMUNITY BACK TO PANTHEON
YOU0000000509_S0000022 ANOTHER PIECE IS CONFIGURATION
YOU0000000509_S0000034 THE SECOND ONE IS THE DATABASE
YOU0000000509_S0000046 A DEVELOPMENT WORK FLOW
YOU0000000509_S0000061 IT'S WHERE YOU ARE
YOU0000000509_S0000068 YOU ARE ABLE TO SUS OUT ANY SORT OF SURPRISES
YOU0000000509_S0000074 YOU CAN THEN SYNC YOUR DATABASE AND FILES BACK DOWN TO DEV
YOU0000000509_S0000081 THE DATABASE AND THE FILES ALWAYS GO DOWN THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING FROM LIVE DOWN TO SOMEWHERE ELSE
YOU0000000509_S0000091 ALSO IT PUTS YOU IN A POSITION WHERE YOU'RE VERY VERY LIABLE TO MAKE MISTAKES
YOU0000000509_S0000108 WE EXPORT THAT CONFIGURATION SO THAT
YOU0000000509_S0000119 AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TIME TO ACTUALLY DEPLOY
YOU0000000509_S0000132 IT ALSO MEANS THAT YOU CAN VERSION CONTROL YOUR CONFIGURATION
YOU0000000509_S0000148 SYNC THE DATABASE AND FILES DOWN OVERWRITING MY LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
YOU0000000509_S0000156 YOU'RE ABLE TO USE DRUSH COMMANDS TO IMPORT AND EXPORT YOUR CONFIGURATION ALONG THE WAY
YOU0000000509_S0000182 IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO OVERWRITE CHANGES THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING IN CONFIGURATION
YOU0000000509_S0000200 BUT YOU COULD ALSO SETUP TAXONOMY IN ADVANCE TO DEFINE
YOU0000000509_S0000212 I MUCH PREFER THE
YOU0000000509_S0000223 THERE IS ALSO
YOU0000000509_S0000246 LET'S BEGIN

YOU0000000509_S0000514 YOU THEN DEPLOY TO TEST YOU THEN IMPORT CONFIGURATION
YOU0000000509_S0000523 JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU0000000509_S0000532 WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE THIS IS A REQUIRED STEP IF YOU WANT TO DO AUTOMATED TESTING IF YOU WANT FULLY AUTOMATED TESTING TO HAPPEN EVERY TIME THAT YOU DEPLOY
YOU0000000509_S0000559 ALL RIGHT AND WITH THAT
YOU0000000509_S0000572 BE TECHNICAL IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THAT AND TO BE ABLE TO GIVE BACK
YOU0000000509_S0000585 CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME
YOU0000000517_S0000010 AND
YOU0000000517_S0000024 AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT I HAVE THE
YOU0000000517_S0000039 THERE ARE ACTUALLY NOT TWO FRAMES HERE
YOU0000000517_S0000049 WE HAVE A TITLE HERE AT THE TOP WHICH IT ACTUALLY READ FOR US SO NOW WE KNOW WHAT PAGE WE'RE ON
YOU0000000517_S0000057 THAT COULD BE PRETTY ANNOYING
YOU0000000517_S0000071 WE HAD EARLIER
YOU0000000517_S0000078 IT'S A LOT HARDER TO HAVE A WEBSITE THAT YOU'VE ALREADY CREATED
YOU0000000517_S0000083 PLAN FOR ACCESSIBILITY
YOU0000000517_S0000090 WHO WANTS TO DO THIS JOB
YOU0000000517_S0000098 I WOULD SAY
YOU0000000517_S0000108 CAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT A GUY I MEAN YOU COULD GO AS FAR AS SAYING HE'S WEARING A PLAID SHIRT HE'S LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR
YOU0000000517_S0000119 ME AS SIMPLY THE ONE REMEDIATING DOCUMENTS
YOU0000000517_S0000133 I DID
YOU0000000517_S0000150 EXACTLY
YOU0000000517_S0000159 YOU'RE GONNA PRESS A BUTTON BELOW
YOU0000000517_S0000170 THE STANDARD FOR WEB-BASED COLOR WEBPAGES SHALL BE DESIGNED SO THAT ALL INFORMATION CONVEYED WITH COLOR IS ALSO AVAILABLE WITHOUT COLOR
YOU0000000517_S0000177 IMAGE ONE IS FORTY FIVE
YOU0000000517_S0000182 THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE
YOU0000000517_S0000194 ALRIGHT YEAH THE GREEN BUTTON YES SO WHAT WE DID HERE
YOU0000000517_S0000202 TABLES OF TONS OF FUN
YOU0000000517_S0000227 SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE
YOU0000000517_S0000248 THIS IS WHAT THEY GOT
YOU0000000517_S0000260 WITH CAPTIONS
YOU0000000517_S0000284 YES YES
YOU0000000517_S0000313 AT THE CENTER THERE'S NO PARTICULAR AH
YOU0000000525_S0000005 GREETINGS FELLOW NERDS
YOU0000000525_S0000012 I WANT TERTIARY ALCOHOLS TO PERFORM SOME AMATEUR RESEARCH IN MAKING ALKALI METALS LIKE POTASSIUM
YOU0000000525_S0000018 SO THE SOLVENT MUST BE RIGOROUSLY PURIFIED TO ENSURE RELIABILITY AND YIELD
YOU0000000525_S0000030 NOW WE NEED TO ACTIVATE OUR MAGNESIUM
YOU0000000525_S0000037 OKAY STILL NO OBVIOUS SIGNS
YOU0000000525_S0000044 ANYWAY LOOKS LIKE IT'S WORKING
YOU0000000525_S0000050 AT THIS POINT WE CAN START SLOWLY ADDING THE REST OF OUR BROMOHEXANE MIXTURE
YOU0000000525_S0000057 SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE MAGNESIUM IS REACTING WITH THE BROMOHEXANE TO FORM HEXYLMAGNESIUM BROMIDE
YOU0000000525_S0000063 THE ACTUAL NAMED GRIGNARD REACTION IS THE NEXT STEP WHERE THIS STUFF IS REACTED WITH A CARBONYL COMPOUND
YOU0000000525_S0000068 SO YOU NEED AIR-FREE TECHNIQUES AND OCCASIONALLY A GLOVEBOX TO USE THEM EFFECTIVELY BEFORE THEY GO BAD
YOU0000000525_S0000079 FOR THIS PARTICULAR RUN MY TARGET COMPOUND IS TWO METHYL TWO OCTANOL
YOU0000000525_S0000086 FORMING A CARBON CARBON BOND BETWEEN THEM
YOU0000000525_S0000092 CONTINUE LETTING IT REACT FOR TEN MINUTES
YOU0000000525_S0000100 ETHER AND OUR TARGET ALCOHOL
YOU0000000525_S0000110 USING A SEPARATORY FUNNEL WE SEPERATE THE LAYERS AND COLLECT JUST THE UPPER ETHER LAYER
YOU0000000525_S0000116 THIS IS MOSTLY LEFTOVER ETHER SOME ACETONE WATER AND A BIT OF OUR TARGET ALCOHOL
YOU0000000525_S0000121 SURE WE REMOVED MOST OF IT BY SEPARATION BUT ETHER DISSOLVES A SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER IN ITSELF
YOU0000000525_S0000131 NOW I WANT A VARIETY OF TERTIARY ALCOHOLS FOR MY UPCOMING EXPERIMENTS IN MAKING ALKALI METALS SO NOW I'M GOING TO TRY AND MAKE TWO METHYL TWO BUTANOL
YOU0000000525_S0000142 THE BOILING SHOWS AN EXOTHERMIC REACTION OCCURRED SO THE MAGNESIUM IS ACTIVATED
YOU0000000525_S0000150 ONCE AGAIN WE'RE HYDROLYZING OUR ALKOXIDE TO MAKE THE ALCOHOL AND PRECIPITATE MAGNESIUM HYDROXY BROMIDE
YOU0000000525_S0000162 A LOW PURITY FORERUN AND A HIGHER PURITY END RUN
YOU0000000525_S0000168 SO INSTEAD OF A KETONE I'M GOING TO USE AN ESTER
YOU0000000525_S0000177 THIS QUICKLY REACTS WITH ANOTHER EQUIVALENT OF ETHYLMAGNESIUM BROMIDE TO MAKE THREE ETHYL THREE PENTOXY MAGNESIUM BROMIDE
YOU0000000525_S0000183 ANYWAY AFTER THE REACTION IS FINISHED
YOU0000000525_S0000191 ANYWAY WE NOW SEPERATE THE TWO LAYERS USING A SEPARATORY FUNNEL AND RECOVER THE ETHER LAYER ON TOP
YOU0000000525_S0000199 ANYWAY ONCE THE DRYING IS DONE
YOU0000000525_S0000205 BUT THAT STILL LEAVES A TINY LITTLE ETHYL CHAIN
YOU0000000525_S0000212 ONLY THE GRIGNARD REAGENT MATTERS
YOU0000000525_S0000220 INTERESTINGLY I GOT A PRECIPITATE MUCH SOONER
YOU0000000525_S0000230 ONCE IT STOPPED DISTILLING I LET IT COOL
YOU0000000525_S0000236 YOU CAN CHECK IN THE VIDEO DESCRIPTION FOR MORE DETAILS ON IT
YOU0000000525_S0000241 THE BEAUTY OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT EVEN THOUGH OUR TARGET COMPOUND HAS AN EXCESSIVELY HIGH BOILING POINT
YOU0000000525_S0000247 ONLY TINY AMOUNTS OF OUR TARGET ALCOHOL COME OVER WITH EVERY DROP
YOU0000000525_S0000255 THEY'RE ALL PRETTY BAD BECAUSE I'M WORKING UNDER AMATUER CONDITIONS
YOU0000000525_S0000261 SPECIAL THANK YOU TO ALL OF MY SUPPORTERS ON PATREON FOR MAKING THESE SCIENCE VIDEOS POSSIBLE WITH THEIR DONATIONS AND THEIR DIRECTION
YOU0000000533_S0000012 SOME TIME NOW
YOU0000000541_S0000007 THINK ABOUT IT
YOU0000000541_S0000013 THEY'RE INSTANTLY MORE LIKELY TO RESPOND HOW DO YOU FIND THESE WORDS LOOK IN ONLINE FORUMS LIKE REDDIT DOT COM WHERE THE PROBLEM YOUR PRODUCT SOLVES IS DISCUSSED
YOU0000000541_S0000022 I WANT TO PUBLISH A BOOK BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START
YOU0000000541_S0000029 IT WILL JUST BE IGNORED OR REJECTED
YOU0000000541_S0000036 AND PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO EVERY OTHER PART OF THE PUBLISHING PROCESS
YOU0000000541_S0000045 OR EVEN SOME KIND OF GIFT AND DON'T WORRY IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING EXTRA TO OFFER
YOU0000000541_S0000056 IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO LET PEOPLE SEE THERE'S A REAL PERSON BEHIND THE PRODUCT
YOU0000000541_S0000063 BUILD THE OBJECTIONS INTO YOUR SALES COPY
YOU0000000541_S0000070 CAN GO A LONG WAY TOWARD SETTING YOUR CUSTOMER'S MIND AT EASE
YOU0000000541_S0000076 WHETHER IT'S THIRTY DAYS SIXTY DAYS NINETY DAYS OR LIFETIME THIS APPROACH REDUCES THE FINANCIAL RISK TO THE CUSTOMER FOR WHATEVER WINDOW YOU SET FOR THE GUARANTEE
YOU0000000541_S0000085 IF YOU FOUND THIS VIDEO HELPFUL AND YOU WANT MORE CONTENT LIKE THIS
YOU0000000549_S0000019 AND THIS BIT IN THE MIDDLE HERE IS COLLECTIVELY CALLED THE NUCLEUS
YOU0000000549_S0000026 ON THE PERIODIC TABLE YOU WILL SEE LOTS OF BOXES LIKE THIS THIS TELLS YOU ALL ABOUT THE ELEMENTS THIS IS THE ELEMENT'S NAME
YOU0000000549_S0000031 IS THE MASS NUMBER
YOU0000000549_S0000036 THE ATOMIC NUMBER TELLS US THE NUMBER OF PROTONS
YOU0000000549_S0000046 SO THERE IS QUITE A LOT FOR YOU TO DO HERE BECAUSE YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THE CHEMICAL SYMBOLS FOR QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF THINGS
YOU0000000549_S0000054 WE HAVE HYDROGEN WE HAVE OXYGEN
YOU0000000549_S0000059 SO WE NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OXYGENS ON THIS SIDE BECAUSE YOU SEE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH
YOU0000000549_S0000068 WE NEED TO REWRITE THAT NEATLY FOR THE EXAMINER SO WE HAVE ONE TWO BUBBLES
YOU0000000549_S0000076 H TWO
YOU0000000549_S0000083 MIXTURE LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS SOME OF THEM CHEMICALLY BONDED SOME OF THEM NOT
YOU0000000549_S0000093 RUTHERFORD AND MARSDEN DID AN EXPERIMENT TO TEST THE PLUM PUDDING MODEL
YOU0000000549_S0000100 AND SOME OF THEM GOT DEFLECTED AT MASSIVE AMOUNTS
YOU0000000549_S0000105 THE MODEL OF ATOMS CHANGED QUITE A LOT OVER TIME
YOU0000000549_S0000117 THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT ELEMENTS WHICH MEANS THERE ARE GOING TO BE EIGHT ELECTRONS IN THAT SHELL
YOU0000000549_S0000128 SEVEN
YOU0000000549_S0000185 AND YOU WILL ALSO NOTICE THIS IS A VERY EXOTHERMIC REACTION
YOU0000000549_S0000195 THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME MOVEMENT AND SOME VIBRATION BUT THEY'RE NOT FLOWING AT ALL AND THEY CAN'T BE COMPRESSED
YOU0000000549_S0000204 MELTING POINT AND A BOILING POINT OF SEVENTY FOUR
YOU0000000549_S0000216 SO IF THE BOILING POINT IS SEVENTY FOUR THE CONDENSING POINT IS SEVENTY FOUR IF THE MELTING POINT IS NINETEEN THE FREEZING POINT IS NINETEEN
YOU0000000549_S0000226 OR A LOSS
YOU0000000549_S0000232 GROUP SEVEN A MINUS ONE ION
YOU0000000549_S0000239 AND INDICATE THE CHARGE
YOU0000000549_S0000250 METHANE C H FOUR
YOU0000000549_S0000256 EACH LINE IS EQUAL TO A PAIR OF ELECTRONS
YOU0000000549_S0000264 CARBON
YOU0000000549_S0000273 AND WHY IT'S SO GOOD AT CONDUCTING HEAT
YOU0000000549_S0000279 LAYERS CAN SLIDE ACROSS EACH OTHER
YOU0000000549_S0000285 BIT OF A MENTAL BREAK HERE FOR YOU GUYS JUST A TINY PAUSE YOU ARE DOING SO
YOU0000000549_S0000291 IT'S NOT JUST ONE SODIUM COMBINING WITH ONE CHLORINE
YOU0000000549_S0000301 MELTING POINT
YOU0000000549_S0000315 HERE WE HAVE DIAMOND IT IS A GIANT
YOU0000000549_S0000321 SO IN THE VIDEO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE CARBON IS THE BLACK BITS
YOU0000000549_S0000332 BUT EACH CARBON
YOU0000000549_S0000338 GRAPHITE IS WHAT YOU FIND IN PENCILS GRAPHENE IS JUST A SINGLE SHEET
YOU0000000549_S0000347 BUT UNLIKE GRAPHITE WHICH IS SOFT THESE ARE INCREDIBLY HARD
YOU0000000549_S0000357 WHEREAS POLYMERS WITHOUT CROSS LINKS ARE GOING TO MELT UPON HEATING BECAUSE THESE POLYMERS CAN SLIDE ACROSS EACH OTHER WHEREAS THESE ONES CANNOT SLIDE ACROSS EACH OTHER
YOU0000000549_S0000367 WHEN WE ARE WORKING OUT CONCENTRATION
YOU0000000549_S0000374 SO HYDROCHLORIC ACID
YOU0000000549_S0000387 MAGNESIUM
YOU0000000549_S0000398 WE HAVE TWO BUBBLES OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID
YOU0000000549_S0000407 OXYGEN HAS A MASS OF SIXTEEN AND WE HAVE FOUR OXYGENS
YOU0000000549_S0000412 A MOLE IS NOT A RATHER CUTE BLIND BLACK FURRY THING
YOU0000000549_S0000418 IONS
YOU0000000549_S0000428 HYDROGEN PEROXIDE DECOMPOSING INTO WATER
YOU0000000549_S0000433 SO WE CAN INCREASE THAT BY PUTTING

YOU0000000685_S0000019 TO ADD AND START USING A DATA GRID
YOU0000000685_S0000027 AND THEN ADD THE SYNCFUSION BLAZOR SERVICE INSIDE THE CONFIGURE SERVICES METHOD
YOU0000000685_S0000034 THE GRID IS NOT VISUALLY DISPLAYED ON THE BROWSER NOW AS THERE IS NO DATA BOUND TO IT
YOU0000000685_S0000039 SO I WOULD FIND THE MODEL CLASS ORDER
YOU0000000685_S0000045 BASED ON THE ORDER MODEL CLASS
YOU0000000685_S0000050 WHILE INITIALIZING THE COMPONENT

YOU0000000685_S0000103 NOW LET ME QUICKLY SUMMARIZE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS VIDEO
YOU0000000685_S0000109 YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THIS WORKING EXAMPLE FROM THE GITHUB LINK IN THIS VIDEO SUBSCRIPTION
YOU0000000685_S0000114 THANK YOU
YOU0000000693_S0000014 WHICH ADDED THE STAR KEY AND THE HASHT
YOU0000000693_S0000020 TO USE THIS DIAL THE FINGER IS INSERTED TO THE HOLE CORRESPONDING TO THE NUMBER DESIRED
YOU0000000693_S0000028 IGNORING THIS MODEL'S ADDED MODULAR CONNECTION BETWEEN THE HANDSET AND WALL CORD
YOU0000000693_S0000033 EACH AND EVERY ONE HAD TO WITHSTAND AT LEAST ONE OF THESE OH YEAH WELL HAVE A NICE DAY TO YOU TO
YOU0000000693_S0000038 SITTING AT THE BACK ARE A PAIR OF BELLS THESE ARE WHAT MAKE THE DISTINCTIVE RING WITH THE PITCH INTERVAL BETWEEN THEM A DELIGHTFUL MAJOR THIRD
YOU0000000693_S0000045 THOUGH THERE IS A SLIGHT PITCH VARIANCE BETWEEN EACH PHONE
YOU0000000693_S0000051 GO TO DESK ANSWER TELEPHONE
YOU0000000693_S0000068 IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THOUGH THAT THIS PHONE IS ACTUALLY MUCH OLDER
YOU0000000693_S0000074 ONE OF WHICH IS TO ACTUALLY WIRE THE PHONE INTO A RINGER CIRCUIT WHICH CAN MAKE THE PHONE RING WITH THE PRESS OF A BUTTON
YOU0000000693_S0000081 AS THE ACTOR COULD ACTUALLY BE TALKING TO SOMEONE ON THE OTHER END
YOU0000000693_S0000086 YOU COULD JUST ADD A STOCK RECORDING IN POST
YOU0000000693_S0000092 FOR EXAMPLE A RECORDING MADE ON A TAPE REQUIRES THAT THE TAPE MOVE AT PRECISELY THE SAME SPEED WITHOUT ANY VARIATION
YOU0000000693_S0000099 BUT SOMETIMES YOU HEAR A VERY SLOW DISTINCTIVE WOW WHICH IS BY THE WAY TECHNICALLY JUST VERY SLOW FLUTTER
YOU0000000693_S0000108 WHERE THIS WOW COMES FROM IS ALMOST CERTAINLY A VINYL RECORD
YOU0000000693_S0000114 THE TIME FROM PEAK TO PEAK WAS ONE POINT SEVEN EIGHT FOUR SECONDS
YOU0000000693_S0000119 DISCS LIKE THIS COULD BE USED AS A SOURCE OF ANY NUMBER OF SOUNDS
YOU0000000693_S0000128 LISTEN TO THIS RECORDING FROM THE OFFICIAL ALBUM OF EPCOT CENTER
YOU0000000693_S0000134 I'M GUESSING FILM STUDIOS HAD JUST ARCHIVED THESE RECORDINGS AND USED THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN
YOU0000000693_S0000148 ANSWERED A TRIMLINE PHONE
YOU0000000693_S0000157 BUT THROUGHOUT THE SHOW THEY USE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RING
YOU0000000693_S0000167 BUT FROM THE PEOPLE WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES TO MAKE IT ALL SOUND REAL AND BELIEVABLE
YOU0000000703_S0000007 SERIOUSLY ME TOO ACTUALLY SO A FEW YEARS AGO I READ SOME RESEARCH ABOUT SLEEP AND IT CHANGED HOW I THOUGHT ABOUT SLEEPING
YOU0000000703_S0000015 OH THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE OR SO
YOU0000000703_S0000022 CONGRATULATIONS
YOU0000000703_S0000032 HE ALSO HAS A CONSULTING RELATIONSHIP WITH GOOGLE THROUGH OUR SISTER COMPANY VERILY SO PLEASE WELCOME MATT WALKER
YOU0000000703_S0000041 DON'T DESPAIR
YOU0000000703_S0000092 BECAUSE THERE IS A GLOBAL EXPERIMENT PERFORMED ON ONE POINT SIX BILLION PEOPLE ACROSS SEVENTY COUNTRIES TWICE A YEAR
YOU0000000703_S0000108 AND WHAT YOU TYPICALLY THEN HAVE ARE WHAT ARE CALLED MICROSLEEPS WHERE YOUR EYELID WILL JUST PARTIALLY CLOSE
YOU0000000703_S0000122 THE REASON IS BECAUSE AS WE GO THROUGH ADOLESCENCE
YOU0000000703_S0000141 BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA NOW WORRYINGLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN INFANCY AND EVEN CHILDHOOD
YOU0000000703_S0000153 ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH OPPORTUNITY THE REASON THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T GET THE CHANCE TO SLEEP EVEN IF THEY COULD SLEEP THAT AMOUNT
YOU0000000703_S0000161 AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE IPAD READING FIRSTLY IT DELAYED THE RELEASE OF A HORMONE CALLED MELATONIN
YOU0000000703_S0000168 BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ISSUE
YOU0000000703_S0000182 SO TRYING TO STAY AWAY FROM SCREENS IN THE LAST HOUR BEFORE BED ALSO DIMMING DOWN THE LIGHTS IN YOUR HOME
YOU0000000703_S0000190 SO CAFFEINE HAS A HALF-LIFE OF ABOUT SIX HOURS AND A QUARTER-LIFE OF TWELVE HOURS
YOU0000000703_S0000209 AND SEDATION IS NOT SLEEP
YOU0000000703_S0000229 IT'S ALSO DURING DEEP SLEEP BUT ALSO REM SLEEP
YOU0000000703_S0000239 AND THE REASON I MAKE THAT POINT IS MOTHER NATURE HAS THEREFORE NEVER HAD TO FACE THE CHALLENGE OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF EVOLUTION
YOU0000000703_S0000248 AND THEN AFTER ABOUT SIXTY OR SEVENTY MINUTES YOU'LL START TO RISE BACK UP AND YOU'LL HAVE A SHORT REM SLEEP PERIOD
YOU0000000703_S0000261 AND THE REASON THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IN HEALTH CARE WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A MODEL OF HEALTH CARE
YOU0000000703_S0000268 YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE OPPORTUNITY WINDOW TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
YOU0000000703_S0000286 AND IT CAUSES A BIOLOGICAL LAG A MISMATCH BETWEEN YOUR INTERNAL CLOCK AND THE PLACE THAT YOU ARRIVE AND THAT'S WHAT WE CALL JET LAG
YOU0000000703_S0000292 IS CHANGE ALL CLOCKS TO THE NEW TIME ZONE SO YOU'RE NOW IMMEDIATELY REMINDED WHAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH IN TERMS OF A TIME STRUCTURE
YOU0000000703_S0000299 THE SLEEPIER THAT YOU ARE THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO FALL ASLEEP AND STAY ASLEEP
YOU0000000703_S0000306 AND THEN STAY AWAKE FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THAT FOLLOWING DAY DON'T BE TEMPTED TO NAP BECAUSE IF YOU NAP
YOU0000000703_S0000311 THE FIRST IS IN THE MORNING GO OUT AND GET DAYLIGHT
YOU0000000703_S0000317 JUST BE MINDFUL HOWEVER THAT IF YOU GET IT IN AMERICA IT'S NOT REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENT
YOU0000000703_S0000328 WHENEVER YOU SLEEP IN AN UNFAMILIAR LOCATION WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT ONE HALF OF THE BRAIN DOES NOT SLEEP AS DEEPLY AS THE OTHER HALF OF THE BRAIN
YOU0000000703_S0000348 TAKING TOYS OUT OF THE BEDROOM IS A RECENT FINDING THAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS THAT THE BEDROOM IS THIS THING OTHER THAN SLEEP AND TOYS BECOME A TRIGGER AND THEY ACTUALLY SLEEP WORSE WHEN THEY'VE GOT TOYS IN THE BEDROOM
YOU0000000703_S0000356 SO TRYING TO HELP KIDS SLEEP BETTER WILL ULTIMATELY HELP YOU SLEEP BETTER
YOU0000000703_S0000364 TURNED OUT THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE PEOPLE ADHERED TO THE TREATMENT THE OTHER HALF DIDN'T
YOU0000000703_S0000382 SO THERE'S THIS THING CALLED TOO MUCH SLEEP AND IT'S BAD AND I SHOULDN'T BE SLEEPING AS MUCH
YOU0000000703_S0000389 BUT GRADUALLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT YOU WILL SLEEP OFF SOME OF THAT DEBT EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ALL BACK
YOU0000000703_S0000395 HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT TYPE YOU ARE WELL
YOU0000000703_S0000400 IF YOU SLEEP IN A MISMATCHED FASHION WITH YOUR CHRONOTYPE YOU WON'T GET GOOD SLEEP AND YOU WILL STRUGGLE WITH SLEEP
YOU0000000703_S0000425 SO I WOULDN'T GET TOO HUNG UP IF THESE DEVICES ARE TELLING YOU YOU'RE HAVING VERY LITTLE DEEP SLEEP
YOU0000000703_S0000437 WELL THINK ABOUT YOUR MATTRESS
YOU0000000703_S0000449 WHICH IS THAT IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING WITH YOUR SLEEP AT NIGHT
YOU0000000703_S0000454 SO IF YOU ARE NOT STRUGGLING WITH SLEEP AND YOU CAN NAP REGULARLY NAPS ARE JUST FINE
YOU0000000703_S0000464 AND YOU NEED TO BREAK THAT ASSOCIATION
YOU0000000711_S0000009 IT COULD BE A DESIRE FOR THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
YOU0000000711_S0000015 RAHEEM TURNED DOWN A CONTRACT
YOU0000000711_S0000025 THANKS FOR WATCHING AND PLEASE LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE
YOU0000000719_S0000009 MARIO
YOU0000000719_S0000022 HE TRIED OUT MANY VENTURES AND OVER THE FOLLOWING YEARS NINTENDO RAN A TAXI COMPANY A TV NETWORK A FOOD BRAND AND EVEN A SERIES OF LOVE HOTELS
YOU0000000719_S0000033 MORSE CODE HAD ITS OWN FORM OF ABBREVIATION WITH CERTAIN NUMBERS BEING GIVEN A MEANING SO AS TO SAVE ON UNNECESSARY TAPPING TIME
YOU0000000719_S0000039 LIKE AN INSIDE JOKE FOR LINCOLN
YOU0000000719_S0000050 AND IF YOU WANTED SOMETHING FASTER THAN RELYING ON THE POSTMAN THEN YOU TURNED TO THE FAX MACHINE
YOU0000000719_S0000059 A METAL STYLUS WOULD MOVE ACROSS THE SHEET AND WOULD REGISTER THE CURRENT
YOU0000000719_S0000065 I'VE FOUND SOMEONE ELSE
YOU0000000719_S0000073 ONE THEORY IS THAT IT STARTED AS AN A INSIDE AN E TO DENOTE EACH AT RATHER THAN JUST AT
YOU0000000719_S0000080 THE SLOVAKS CALL IT PICKLED HERRING AND THE DUTCH SOMETIMES CALL IT LITTLE MONKEY'S TESTICLE
YOU0000000719_S0000092 NOW HERE'S A SNACK THAT IS FAR OLDER THAN YOU'D EXPECT
YOU0000000719_S0000101 LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES YOU EAT THEM ALL YOURSELF AS SOON AS YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY
YOU0000000719_S0000109 WHEN EARLY INTERNET CHAT ROOMS BEGAN SOME USERS WOULD REPEATEDLY TYPE SPAM IN ORDER TO SHIFT A LINE OF TEXT OFF-SCREEN
YOU0000000719_S0000118 HE SAYS THERE'S SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAITING FOR ME IN A TRUST ACCOUNT
YOU0000000729_S0000019 UNDER WIFI SERVICES YOU'LL SEE TWO OPTIONS TALKING ABOUT SUGGESTED OPEN HOTSPOTS
YOU0000000729_S0000032 AND APPARENTLY USES IT TO GET TO KNOW YOU AND MAKE BETTER SUGGESTIONS
YOU0000000729_S0000046 INKING AND TYPING DATA WHICH IS LITERALLY ANYTHING YOU TYPE
YOU0000000729_S0000058 I PERSONALLY WOULDN'T DISABLE NOTIFICATIONS ALTOGETHER BECAUSE THEY CAN BE USEFUL
YOU0000000729_S0000067 WHICH COULD BE ANNOYING SPEAKING OF ANNOYING LET'S DISABLE THE OBNOXIOUS SUGGESTED APPS YOU SEE IN THE START MENU WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY ADVERTISEMENTS
YOU0000000729_S0000085 BUT YOU WILL NEED LOCATION SERVICES ENABLED IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT
YOU0000000729_S0000102 SO IT'S AT LEAST GOOD TO KNOW THAT THESE FILES EXIST
YOU0000000737_S0000019 MONITOR HERE
YOU0000000737_S0000030 AND THEN THE CADENCE SENSOR WITH TWO OF THE RUBBER MOUNTING STRAPS WILL COME IN AT TWELVE GRAMS SO FAIRLY LIGHT OVERALL
YOU0000000737_S0000043 YOU DON'T GET THE SATISFYING CLICK WHEN YOU PUT IT IN AS IT JUST GETS A LITTLE MORE FRICTION BUT I FOUND THAT ONCE YOU GET CLOSE TO CENTER IT GETS REALLY HIGH FRICTION SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY ADJUST IT LEFT TO RIGHT SLIGHTLY AND IT WORKS OUT PRETTY WELL IT DOESN'T RATTLE OR JITTER ON THE MOUNT
YOU0000000737_S0000063 NOW THIS IS WHERE THE BUTTON INTERFACE IS A LITTLE BIT NON-INTUITIVE THE BACK BUTTON ON THE LEFT IS TO OPEN A MENU
YOU0000000737_S0000073 YOU HAVE THE CADENCE
YOU0000000737_S0000079 SO THAT'S IT NOW WE HAVE BOTH SENSORS CONNECTED
YOU0000000737_S0000086 YOU CAN PICK WHICH BIKE YOU WANT THIS IS WHERE USE THE BACK THE TWO LEFT BUTTONS GO UP AND DOWN

YOU0000000907_S0000337 BUT AGAIN
YOU0000000907_S0000343 THE STITCHING THAT YOU DO IS AWESOME AND YOU MATTER
YOU0000000915_S0000005 AND AS AN ACTOR
YOU0000000923_S0000008 I LIKE PLAYING MY GUITAR AND I LIKE INSTRUMENTAL STUFF AND I DO ONE TONIGHT YOU KNOW BUT TO ME A SONG IS ABOUT A SINGER
YOU0000000923_S0000022 THAT'S AWESOME WELL YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW GUITARISTS
YOU0000000931_S0000016 A COWBOY HAT AND SOME KIND OF SLIGHTLY PINK TINTED SUNGLASSES
YOU0000000939_S0000007 WOW THAT'S A LOT THE LAST TIME I READ THIRTY THREE BOOKS IN A MONTH WAS FEBRUARY WHICH AS I SAID WAS PRE-COVID
YOU0000000939_S0000015 I AM ADDING IN REREADS BECAUSE I SEEM TO BE DOING MORE REREADING AND I ALSO HAVE A NEW ADDITION TO AUDIOBOOKS SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND JUMP TO THOSE
YOU0000000939_S0000021 ONE OF THEM WAS A AUDIO REVIEW COPY FROM THE PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE VOLUMES APP ONE OF THEM WAS FROM LIBRO FM
YOU0000000939_S0000034 FOUR SCI-FI THREE NON-FICTION AND ONE CONTEMPORARY
YOU0000000939_S0000040 THEN FIVE BOOKS GOT THREE STARS
YOU0000000939_S0000048 SO THIS SOUNDED REALLY INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE I LIVE A MULTI-HYPHEN LIFE IN THAT I HAVE MULTIPLE JOBS AND MULTIPLE TYPES OF RESPONSIBILITIES
YOU0000000939_S0000055 AS LIKE A VERY VERY BASIC INTRODUCTION UM BUT THAT WAS NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR SO THIS WAS NOT FOR ME AND I DNF'D IT
YOU0000000939_S0000064 THEN I GAVE TWO AND A HALF STARS TO BREAKING DAWN BY STEPHANIE MEYER
YOU0000000939_S0000071 WHICH IS SUPER INTERESTING
YOU0000000939_S0000077 TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF IT AS I WAS READING IT I WAS LIKE OH THIS IS SO GOOD THIS IS GONNA BE FIVE STARS IT FOLLOWS A PRINCESS WHO IS POISONOUS TO THE TOUCH WHO'S BEEN HIDDEN AWAY AS KIND OF A SECRET
YOU0000000939_S0000083 AND LIKE STUFF HAPPENS BUT REALLY THE ARC OF THIS IS ABOUT OUR MAIN CHARACTERS KIND OF EMOTIONAL AND RELATIONAL JOURNEY
YOU0000000939_S0000093 ANOTHER PART OF THE HORROR IS THE RACISM AND HOMOPHOBIA THAT CAN BE FOUND IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH
YOU0000000939_S0000104 THIS IS A FEMALE FEMALE HISTORICAL ROMANCE AND AH THIS ONE WAS LIKE INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE WERE THINGS I LOVED ABOUT IT
YOU0000000939_S0000109 I LOVE THE FACT THAT IT'S FINDING BEAUTY IN BODIES THAT AREN'T PERFECT I LOVED THE FRIENDS TO LOVERS PART OF IT
YOU0000000939_S0000115 I THINK IT'S JUST NEEDED AN EDITOR TO TELL HER HEY THESE ARE ALL GREAT THINGS THAT YOU'VE RESEARCHED AND WANT TO TALK ABOUT BUT IT'S TOO MUCH SO PICK TWO THINGS AND PUT THE REST OF IT IN A DIFFERENT BOOK
YOU0000000939_S0000120 AND FEMINIST ISSUES AND HOW THOSE AFFECTED WOMEN IN DIFFERENT CLASS STRUCTURES POLITICS SURROUNDING THE QUEEN AND THE KING TRYING TO GET A DIVORCE FROM HER AND HOW THAT AFFECTED DIFFERENT THINGS
YOU0000000939_S0000127 MOVING ON
YOU0000000939_S0000133 I DON'T KNOW LIKE I FINISHED THE BOOK AND I'M LIKE WOW BRYAN STEVENSON IS AN AMAZING PERSON AND HE SACRIFICED SO MUCH IN HIS LIFE TO SERVE THESE PEOPLE AND TRY TO SEEK JUSTICE AND TRY TO SEE CHANGE
YOU0000000939_S0000141 BUT I'M GLAD THAT I READ IT AND I WOULD FOR SURE RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS
YOU0000000939_S0000147 AND THIS I WOULD ACTUALLY CALL QUIET HORROR
YOU0000000939_S0000155 THEY ARE SPOILERY
YOU0000000939_S0000162 SO THIS FOLLOWS A TEEN GIRL WHO FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS OF HER LIFE HAD BEEN KEPT COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM TECHNOLOGY
YOU0000000939_S0000168 I THINK IT'S EXPLORING A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING IDEAS ABOUT OUR COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP WITH TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA
YOU0000000939_S0000175 BUT I FOR SURE ENJOYED IT IT FOLLOWS A TEEN GIRL WHO LOVES BOOKS AND AN ALIEN WHO LOVES POP MUSIC ON A MISSION TO SAVE THE WORLD SO THIS IS AN INTERESTING BOOK BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND
YOU0000000939_S0000186 AND REALLY REALLY WANTS TO SETTLE DOWN WITH A NICE WOMAN AND HAVE A FAMILY
YOU0000000939_S0000191 THIS WAS REALLY REALLY GREAT IT WAS FUNNY IT WAS SEXY
YOU0000000939_S0000201 I LIKED IT I DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BUT I CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE WANTED A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM IT THAN WHAT THEY GOT
YOU0000000939_S0000210 I THOUGHT THAT THE FINAL PORTION OF IT WHERE SHE GOES TO LOS ANGELES AND TALKS ABOUT HOW THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SORT OF LIKE THE PROMISED LAND BUT OFTEN ENDED UP HAVING A LOT OF THE SAME ISSUES WITH RACISM AND DE FACTO SEGREGATION
YOU0000000939_S0000216 BUT NEVER GOT AROUND TO THE THIRD ONE AND SO I'M GONNA BE READING ALONG WITH THEM
YOU0000000939_S0000224 THIS COUPLE IS FALLING IN LOVE WHILE ENGAGING IN SIT-INS AND FREEDOM BUS RIDES AND BEING PUT IN JAIL FOR PROTESTING
YOU0000000939_S0000234 FULLY RECOMMEND I ALSO GAVE FIVE STARS TO A REREAD A CHILDHOOD FAVORITE AND THIS WAS SUPER FUN BECAUSE I READ IT ALOUD WITH MY SIX YEAR OLD IT HAS BEEN SUPER COOL BECAUSE HE'S FINALLY AT THE POINT WHERE WE CAN START READING CHAPTER BOOKS AND I CAN START SHARING SOME OF MY FAVORITES
YOU0000000939_S0000240 AND IS NOT INTERESTED IN ANYTHING
YOU0000000939_S0000250 BUT THIS IS THE YEAR OF THE WITCHING BY ALEXIS HENDERSON OH MAN THIS WAS SO GOOD THIS IS EXACTLY MY KIND OF HORROR
YOU0000000939_S0000256 AND THEN AFTER SHE WAS BORN HER MOM WAS KILLED FOR BEING A WITCH
YOU0000000939_S0000261 THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY INTENSE SUBJECT MATTER THAT'S ADDRESSED HERE AND THAT IS WHERE THE WORST OF THE HORROR LIES
YOU0000000939_S0000270 I DID NOT EXPECT TO READ QUITE AS MUCH AS I DID I READ A LOT
YOU0000000951_S0000028 WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF HEALTH INSURANCE I THINK THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY ONES
YOU0000000951_S0000048 IT'S JUST RANDOM CHANCE THAT ONE HAS INSURANCE AND ONE DOESN'T AND IN PARTICULAR THE REASON ONE HAS INSURANCE AND ONE DOESN'T ISN'T CORRELATED WITH THE OUTCOME WE'RE LOOKING AT LIKE HEALTH CARE USE
YOU0000000951_S0000062 AND BY THE WAY THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE POPULATION WHO IS GETTING MEDICAID UNDER THE OBAMACARE EXPANSIONS LOW-INCOME ADULTS WHO WEREN'T PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID
YOU0000000951_S0000084 IF YOU'RE INTERESTED SIGN UP
YOU0000000951_S0000112 FINANCIAL STRAIN AND THEIR SELF-REPORTED HEALTH AND WELL BEING

YOU0000000951_S0000143 AND AS WAS JUST POINTED OUT
YOU0000000951_S0000152 ON THE OTHER HAND
YOU0000000951_S0000166 I'M GOING TO SPEED UP A LITTLE AND JUST VERY QUICKLY TELL YOU ABOUT A BUNCH OF OTHER RESULTS
YOU0000000951_S0000177 THE PROBABILITY OF HAVING A MEDICAL COLLECTION GOES DOWN A LOT EVEN A NON-MEDICAL COLLECTION MAY GO DOWN
YOU0000000951_S0000186 YOU DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS THERE COULD'VE BEEN A BIG EFFECT AND I JUST DON'T HAVE THE STATISTICAL POWER TO DETECT IT
YOU0000000951_S0000206 BUT YOU ACTUALLY SEE THEY'RE GETTING INCREASED DIAGNOSES OF DEPRESSION
YOU0000000951_S0000218 ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR RESULTS FOR BLOOD PRESSURE
YOU0000000951_S0000228 AND THEN IN TERMS OF HEALTH THERE'S SOME REAL BENEFITS IMPROVEMENTS IN SELF-REPORTED HEALTH REDUCED DEPRESSION
YOU0000000951_S0000240 AND FINALLY
YOU0000000951_S0000257 HEALTH INSURANCE INCREASES HEALTH CARE USE AND HEALTH CARE SPENDING IN THE LONG RUN
YOU0000000951_S0000270 ECONOMIC THEORY SAYS THAT THE OPTIMAL THING TO DO

YOU0000000967_S0000255 AGAIN
YOU0000000967_S0000270 IT'S TRANSFORMING THAT ENERGY LANDSCAPE TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS
YOU0000000967_S0000279 AND THE USA CAN ALSO SOON BECOME A WORLD LEADER IN OFFSHORE WIND
YOU0000000967_S0000285 MUCH HAS ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED IN MASSACHUSETTS THROUGH THE VISION FORESIGHT AND COMMITMENT OF STATE LEGISLATORS
YOU0000000967_S0000291 THE LEADERSHIP OF PEOPLE LIKE MATT MITCHELL

YOU0000000967_S0000305 NOT JUST IN DIRECT JOBS
YOU0000000967_S0000312 SO IT COMES AT NO SURPRISE THAT OTHER MARINE USERS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS THAT LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENT COULD HAVE ON THEIR ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
YOU0000000967_S0000321 SO WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THIS REGION OF THE SOUTH COAST AROUND FALL RIVER AND NEW BEDFORD EVEN INTO RHODE ISLAND HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME A MAJOR HUB OF ACTIVITY

YOU0000000975_S0000081 AND THAT ISN'T DONE ALWAYS FROM ALL DIFFERENT SIDES OF THIS DEBATE
YOU0000000975_S0000098 AND EVEN THE TTITLE THE TERM AND THE IDEA OF NEW TRIBALISM
YOU0000000975_S0000110 AND THEY TEND TO BE VIEWS ON ISSUES OF RACE IDENTITY IMMIGRATION
YOU0000000975_S0000117 AND

YOU0000000975_S0000133 IT'S A
YOU0000000975_S0000141 WHEN I TALK ABOUT OUT OF AFRICA
YOU0000000975_S0000149 WERE IT NOT FOR MY EXPERIENCE OF SPENDING SEVEN YEARS IN THAT CITY
YOU0000000975_S0000172 AND HOW THAT FORMATION PERHAPS GAVE YOU A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
YOU0000000975_S0000184 AND IT REALLY WASN'T UNTIL I CAME TO LONDON THAT I'VE ACTUALLY REFLECTED ON SO THIS THING THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE ABOUT I'M NOT LEARNING ABOUT THIS FAMILY HISTORY I DIDN'T REALLY REFLECT ON THAT UNTIL I WAS IN A CITY LIKE LONDON AND REALISING
YOU0000000975_S0000191 ALSO KIND OF FILTERED IN TO HOW I WAS UNDERSTANDING THESE IDEAS OF BELONGING
YOU0000000975_S0000207 I KIND OF UNDERSTOOD WHY THAT WAS
YOU0000000975_S0000225 AND STRUGGLING WITH THOSE QUESTIONS AND CERTAINLY I STRUGGLED WITH THOSE QUESTIONS FOR
YOU0000000975_S0000233 BUT I GUESS THE THING I WOULD SAY IS

YOU0000000975_S0000254 WE DEFIED ROME
YOU0000000975_S0000260 RACISM IS JUST ABOUT BEING MEAN TO SOMEONE WHO'S A BIT DIFFERENT TO YOU
YOU0000000975_S0000267 WHY THERE'S SUCH A REACTION BECAUSE HOW CAN YOU CHALLENGE STACEY DOOLEY

YOU0000000975_S0000368 AND SO I THINK ACTUALLY
YOU0000000975_S0000376 WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU ARE TOTALLY DENYING ANY DEBATE OR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW RACE IS FUNCTIONING IN THE DEBATE WHICH IS CRUCIAL FOR ME HOW IT'S FUNCTIONING IN LEGISLATION
YOU0000000975_S0000386 AND THEREFORE IN MY WRITING I WANTED TO DRAW ON ANTHROPOLOGY
YOU0000000975_S0000396 EXPECT NIGEL FARAGE AND OTHERS TO OCCUPY THE TERRITORY I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHAT I WAS ALSO WRITING

YOU0000001133_S0000109 WHAT IS THIS
YOU0000001133_S0000137 AND WE ASK EVERY GUEST WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR NEON SIGN TO SAY
YOU0000001141_S0000018 IS CIRCUMCISION STEP LEVEL OR IS REALLY DESIGNED TO PERFORM CIRCUMCISIONS IN CHILDREN
YOU0000001141_S0000031 THERE IS ALSO COMPLICATED ELIMINATES ALL OF THAT
YOU0000001141_S0000047 THEN THERE ARE THE TRADITIONAL SLEEVE DISSECTION AMATEUR W H O
YOU0000001141_S0000062 MAYBE AT A RATE THAT IS EVEN CHEAPER THAN GETTING A REGULAR CARTRIDGE THAT CIRCUMCISION ANYWHERE IN INDIA
YOU0000001149_S0000054 WE'LL COME BACK TO
YOU0000001149_S0000074 BASICALLY ADVOCACY USES CERTAIN DOCUMENTS OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THOUGHT
YOU0000001149_S0000090 I WAS STRUCK ON REREADING IT SANDY
YOU0000001149_S0000133 I WAS IN THE OFFICE PREPARING
YOU0000001149_S0000161 I JUST WANTED TO SAY
YOU0000001149_S0000169 AND THEREFORE THE NEED FOR THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO GUNS THE MILITIA RIGHT
YOU0000001149_S0000189 SO HERE IS WHERE I THINK THE SECOND AMENDMENT ORIGINATES
YOU0000001149_S0000203 THIS IS AGAINST A BACKGROUND THAT WOULD ALSO ALLOW CONGRESS TO CREATE INTERIOR APPROPRIATION INCREMENTS A STANDING ARMY
YOU0000001149_S0000210 SO THAT MILITIAS WERE THE PEOPLE'S RESISTANCE TO GOVERNMENTAL TYRANNY
YOU0000001149_S0000221 THERE HAS TO BE AN AMENDMENT AND WHEN MADISON PROMISES AMENDMENTS
YOU0000001149_S0000231 REFERS TO THE PEOPLE COLLECTIVELY
YOU0000001149_S0000243 WHICH IN EVERY INSTANCE WE COULD FIND
YOU0000001149_S0000261 SOME SPECULATIVE RESPONSES TO AN EGOCENTRIC QUESTION
YOU0000001149_S0000274 SO THAT'S ONE WAY OF ANSWERING IT THEN THERE'S THE MORE LAWYERLY ANSWER
YOU0000001149_S0000282 AND THEY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES PERCOLATING AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YOU0000001149_S0000292 ORIGINALIST HANDGUN
YOU0000001149_S0000309 AND I'D RATHER GET THE TIME TO TEACH QUINN VERSUS PENNSYLVANIA AND DRED SCOTT
YOU0000001149_S0000322 CITIZENS HAVE A RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS
YOU0000001149_S0000339 WHY DID HE ASSIGN IT TO SCALIA
YOU0000001149_S0000353 IF THAT HAPPENS MY HUNCH IS THAT ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT THOMAS REALIZES THAT HE HAS NEVER
YOU0000001149_S0000370 AND THAT
YOU0000001149_S0000406 BUT IF YOU DO BELIEVE IN DOCTRINALISTS
YOU0000001149_S0000423 THEN YOU MIGHT BELIEVE THAT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE MORE APPROPRIATE
YOU0000001149_S0000456 THE QUESTION IS
YOU0000001149_S0000470 THEY'VE COMMITTED A FELONY
YOU0000001149_S0000498 THEY COULD SAY YOU'VE GOT TO CONSIDER APPLICATIONS FROM OUTSIDE THE FIVE BOROUGHS IF THEY SHOW THEY'RE MEETING A NEED THAT IS NOT SERVED

YOU0000001553_S0000117 NOW EVEN IF WE PUT ASIDE THE MOUNTAINS OF EVIDENCE POINTING TOWARD COLLUSION OR TRUMP'S FINANCIAL TIES TO RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS OR THE POSSIBILITY THAT RUSSIA HAS COMPROMISING INFORMATION ON HIM
YOU0000001553_S0000126 HE'S SELLING OUT OUR DEMOCRACY AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WORD FOR IT HEARTBREAKING
YOU0000001561_S0000007 WELL YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO READ THE BOOK TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE CREATED TO DO
YOU0000001561_S0000015 A CHARACTER IN HER NEW BOOK MIDDLE GAME SAYS NUMBERS ARE SIMPLE OBEDIENT THINGS
YOU0000001561_S0000024 BUT I WILL NOT BE CRUEL TO HIM

YOU0000001561_S0000043 THAT'S ABOUT ALL I CAN SAY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE BOOK ISN'T OUT
YOU0000001561_S0000049 SO ONE OF THE EXCITING THINGS ABOUT BEING A TRADITIONALLY PUBLISHED AUTHOR WHICH MEANS I WRITE A BOOK AND A PUBLISHER TAKES IT AND THEY TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THE WORK OF MAKING IT SOMETHING YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO READ AND THEY GET IT ON SHELVES
YOU0000001561_S0000056 I HAVE NO CREDIBILITY IF I'M TELLING THEM THAT THEY SHOULD PAY ME MONEY
YOU0000001561_S0000064 THE FACT THAT THEY KEPT OUR ENTIRE CREATIVE TEAM MEANS THAT THEY STILL HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN THE STORIES THAT WE HAVE TO TELL
YOU0000001561_S0000071 I DID NOT READ THOSE INITIAL ISSUES BECAUSE GWEN STACY IS VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART
YOU0000001561_S0000081 I HADN'T READ THEM WHEN MARVEL CALLED ME AND SAID DO YOU WANT TO WRITE SPIDER GWEN AND IT REALLY WAS I HAD AGREE TO TAKE A CALL WITH THE SPIDER OFFICE EVEN THOUGH I WANTED TO WORK FOR THE X OFFICE FIGURING NOTHING WOULD COME OF IT AND THE EDITOR SAID ARE YOU INTERESTED IN WRITING GWEN

YOU0000001561_S0000102 I LIKE Q AND A
YOU0000001561_S0000116 LIKE I DON'T DO STAND ALONE
YOU0000001561_S0000123 SO IF YOU EVER ENCOUNTER A WACKY ANIMAL STORY THAT I HAVE TOLD THEY ARE ALL COMPLETELY TRUE AND MOST OF THEM HAVE NO PHOTO DOCUMENTATION BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT WHEN A RATTLESNAKE HAS LATCHED ONTO MY ASS I'M NOT REACHING FOR A CAMERA
YOU0000001561_S0000130 EVERYBODY WINS
YOU0000001561_S0000138 SO AS TO PIN BOTH WINGS AND YOU HOLD IT LIKE IT'S A CORGI

YOU0000001561_S0000200 AND I AM A FAN-FIC PURIST ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO ME IN MY SPECIFIC WRITING IS MAKING SURE THAT THE CHARACTERS BEHAVE IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY INTERFACE WITH THE ORIGINAL MATERIAL WILL RECOGNIZE

YOU0000001561_S0000377 I HATE EVERYTHING
YOU0000001561_S0000384 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T LET PEOPLE DRIVE YOU OUT OF IT AND YOU DON'T LET THE GATEKEEPERS OF OUR GENRE TELL YOU THAT IF YOU DON'T FIND IT IN YOURSELF TO LOVE THE DRY DUSTY OLD THINGS THAT THEY HAVE BUILT THEIR SELF-IDENTITIES ON YOU'RE NOT REALLY A FAN
YOU0000001561_S0000389 BUT IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE GIVEN A LIST THAT YOU MUST FULFIL TO TRULY BELONG HERE

YOU0000001569_S0000025 THE SPOT IS OF COURSE A JOKE BUT IT ISN'T ENTIRELY FICTION IT TOUCHES ON THE GROWING AWARENESS SURROUNDING MEAT'S CLIMATE AND HEALTH ISSUES NO ONE LIKES ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH EATING ANIMALS SO THE IMPLAUSIBLE BURGER ALLOWS YOU TO PLAUSIBLY BELIEVE THAT YOU AREN'T

YOU0000001617_S0000587 AND AGAIN THAT'S
YOU0000001617_S0000609 AND MUCH MORE FISH
YOU0000001617_S0000624 ALMOST EVERY ONE OF US WOULD SAY IF WE HAVE A
YOU0000001617_S0000642 BUT THAT'S REALLY JUST STARTED
YOU0000001617_S0000656 THANK YOU
YOU0000001617_S0000669 IS DR BRYAN ROBERTS FROM LUMCON AND ALSO THE COASTAL WATERS CONSORTIA
YOU0000001617_S0000685 THESE ECOSYSTEMS ARE PRETTY COMPLEX
YOU0000001617_S0000695 IF YOU DO NOT HAVE GOOD BASELINE DATA
YOU0000001617_S0000704 WEAPONS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DOMINATED BY SPARCTERNO TERREFLORA
YOU0000001617_S0000711 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A SOLID BASELINE
YOU0000001617_S0000723 PHOSPHOROUS CYCLE
YOU0000001617_S0000737 AND HETEROTROPHS WHICH ARE NOURISHED FROM OTHERS
YOU0000001617_S0000744 SO THAT INCLUDES ALL OF US
YOU0000001617_S0000764 BERRY TERRE BAY
YOU0000001617_S0000781 ACROSS THE WHOLE REGION
YOU0000001617_S0000801 EXCEPT FOR WHEN WE HAVE HIGHER WATER LEVELS AND WE USE THE FLOATING CHAMBER METHOD
YOU0000001617_S0000818 THE DATA THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW SUGGESTS THAT IT MAY BE DUE TO CHANGES IN METHANE-OXIDIZING BACTERIA COMMUNITIES
YOU0000001617_S0000849 SO
YOU0000001617_S0000855 WE TEND TO THINK ABOUT CARBON DIOXIDE RELEASES THE ATMOSPHERE AND HOW THAT CORRELATES WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND WARMING
YOU0000001617_S0000870 SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT REALLY STRUCK US WAS HOW HIGH OUR NITRIFICATION RATES
YOU0000001617_S0000894 BUT INTERESTINGLY
YOU0000001617_S0000904 NITRIFICATION DOES TAKE AN INCREASE WITH THESE ABUNDANCES BUT IT ONLY EXPLAINS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE VARIANCE
YOU0000001617_S0000917 CARBON AND TOTAL NITROGEN
YOU0000001617_S0000934 IS THAT IN UNOILED SITES
YOU0000001617_S0000943 YOU CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THAT COMMUNITY
YOU0000001617_S0000955 BUT WE DO NOT SEE ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REGION OR BETWEEN OILED AND UNOILED SITES
YOU0000001617_S0000970 BUT WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE WHOLE DATA SET AS PHOSPHOROUS
YOU0000001617_S0000988 METHANE TRENDS FOR DECLINES IN OILED AND INCREASES IN UNOILED MARSHES
YOU0000001617_S0000995 SO NOW NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE WITHIN EACH REGION WE HAVE ALL THREE REGIONS
YOU0000001617_S0001004 LOOK AT THE PHOSPHOROUS SORPTION
YOU0000001617_S0001015 AND JUST TO SAVE US FROM ALL LOOKING AT HUNTER'S GRASS
YOU0000001617_S0001050 IS VERY IMPORTANT
YOU0000001617_S0001061 AND SO UNDERSTANDING HOW THESE THINGS ARE CONNECTED I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT
YOU0000001617_S0001085 I POINTED OUT THAT AT TERREBONE SITES WE HAD A COUPLE SITES THAT WE'VE ALREADY LOST TEN METERS IN THREE YEARS
YOU0000001617_S0001101 BUT IN TERMS OF THE BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES AND THAT FUNCTIONING COMPONENT OF THAT SYSTEM
YOU0000001617_S0001125 THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION
YOU0000001617_S0001175 AND SO WE DID A LOT OF SAMPLING OR WE DID SOME SAMPLING IN ALABAMA AT THREE SITES
YOU0000001617_S0001185 GRANDE TERRE WAS THE ONLY LOCATION THAT ESSENTIALLY WAS IMPACTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY OIL
YOU0000001617_S0001202 THE BLUEPRINT FROM WHICH PROTEINS ARE MADE
YOU0000001617_S0001212 REMAINS CONSTANT
YOU0000001617_S0001225 THIS WOULD BE THE END OF JUNE AFTER OILING
YOU0000001617_S0001241 SO
YOU0000001617_S0001257 NOW THIS IS A GOOD THING YOU'RE TRYING TO METABOLIZE THE OIL
YOU0000001617_S0001286 WHAT'S INTERESTING IS A PAPER CAME OUT AROUND THE SAME TIME
YOU0000001617_S0001300 AND SO THERE'S SOME INDICATIONS OF ALTERED CARDIAC PHYSIOLOGY
YOU0000001617_S0001318 QUICK ONE HERE
YOU0000001617_S0001354 AND SO EXPOSURE TO FIELD COLLECTED SEDIMENTS INCREASES TIME-TO-HATCH AND REDUCES THE PERCENT HATCH KILLIFISH EMBRYOS
YOU0000001617_S0001374 WHERE WE ARE BASICALLY COLLECTING DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OF KILLIFISH FROM FLORIDA THROUGH TEXAS
YOU0000001617_S0001392 INTERESTINGLY WHEN WE EXPOSE THESE PARENTS TO OIL FOR FORTY DAYS
YOU0000001617_S0001404 OUR VINCE BAYOU WHICH IS OUR
YOU0000001617_S0001416 THEY DIDN'T SURVIVE
YOU0000001617_S0001442 AND IN FISH WE DON'T KNOW
YOU0000001617_S0001456 THESE ARE VERY HIGH EXPRESSION
YOU0000001617_S0001492 IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR NOT LIKE BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
YOU0000001617_S0001529 SCUBA DIVING AND LOOKING AT REMOTE SENSING OF CORAL
YOU0000001617_S0001570 SO THE IDEA WAS TO LOOK AT FOUR PARAMETERS
YOU0000001617_S0001583 AND YOU GET A REALLY HIGH FREQUENCY CONSTRUCTION WEEKLY FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
YOU0000001617_S0001592 RESTORATION PROJECTS
YOU0000001617_S0001609 WHETHER IT IS LAND SIDE OR MOTIS OR ANY OTHER SENSOR
YOU0000001617_S0001619 WHICH ARE MUCH HEAVIER LIKE FIFTY POUNDS OR SO SO THEY CANNOT MOUNT IT BUT THEY ARE VERY ACCURATE
YOU0000001617_S0001629 IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH PIGMENT
YOU0000001617_S0001650 SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXACT AREA THAT GOT SCANNED
YOU0000001617_S0001682 WHICH IS TAKEN FROM THE FRAME WHICH IS SIXTEEN FEET ALTITUDE
YOU0000001617_S0001716 AND YOUR TWO THOUSAND AND TEN IMAGE
YOU0000001617_S0001752 IN THE FRINGING MARSHES YOU CAN SEE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT OF THE SPILL
YOU0000001617_S0001765 MODIS AGUA
YOU0000001617_S0001781 SIMILAR MARSH GRADIENT
YOU0000001617_S0001796 IT'S KIND OF A BIG DATA PROJECT
YOU0000001617_S0001833 THESE ARE THE HURRICANE SIGNATURES YOU CAN SEE HURRICANE ISAAC HERE
YOU0000001617_S0001857 SO YOU CAN SEE THAT'S THE FLUX TOWER
YOU0000001617_S0001882 BUT THIS CAN BE USED
YOU0000001617_S0001903 SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE SIDE
YOU0000001617_S0001931 LIKE TO WELCOME OUR LAST SPEAKER DR
YOU0000001617_S0001952 SO RESPONSE WAS FOCUSED ON GETTING THAT GROSS KIND OF BULK OILING ON THE SHORELINE OR IN NEAR SHORE WATERS SO IT DIDN'T SPREAD TO OTHER AREAS
YOU0000001617_S0001966 VEGETATION MAT
YOU0000001617_S0001988 WITH EITHER NO OIL OR LESS OIL
YOU0000001617_S0002002 AGAIN MOVED A LITTLE BIT OF OIL BUT NOT VERY EFFECTIVE
YOU0000001617_S0002016 A LOT OF THE OIL ON THE SURFACE WAS STARTING TO WEATHER
YOU0000001617_S0002030 WE ALSO SCALED UP TO SOME MECHANICAL TREATMENTS AND DID A COMBINATION OF MANUAL ONLY
YOU0000001617_S0002047 FOCUS ON VEGETATION AND EROSION
YOU0000001617_S0002070 FIRST YEAR MANUAL TREATMENT SEEMED TO BE DOING BEST
YOU0000001617_S0002089 EROSION PRECEDED WHOOPS
YOU0000001617_S0002103 WE SAW SOME INITIAL VEGETATION RECOVERY IMPROVEMENT WITH TREATMENT ESPECIALLY WITH MANUAL TREATMENT BUT SOME WITH MECHANICAL AS WELL
YOU0000001617_S0002122 I WANT TO FOCUS ON PLANTING
YOU0000001617_S0002138 THIS IS SURFACE OIL COVER SO THIS IS RESIDUAL OIL ON THE SOIL SURFACE AS A PERCENT COVER VALUE
YOU0000001617_S0002152 VERY LOW TECH VERY QUICK
YOU0000001617_S0002173 THERE'S OTHER CRITTERS IN THESE MARSHES AS WELL THERE'S FIDDLER CRABS
YOU0000001617_S0002189 WHAT WE WOULD HAVE DONE IN HINDSIGHT
YOU0000001617_S0002204 TRY LOWER INTENSITY TREATMENTS FIRST
YOU0000001617_S0002218 THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PLANTING CAN BE AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION
YOU0000001617_S0002236 BRIE OR BRITTANY BURNICK
YOU0000001617_S0002257 THE WATER WOULD GET IN MORE OF A SEMI-SOLID STATE IT CAN BE LIFTED OUT OF THE MARSH A LOT EASIER
YOU0000001617_S0002300 WHAT THINGS ARE YOU STILL CURIOUS ABOUT AND WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET YOU THAT INFORMATION
YOU0000001617_S0002309 AND SO HOLLAND IS GOING TO BE UP FRONT HERE YOUR EASEL VERY FRONT

YOU0000001775_S0000715 PAST PLANS JUST LOOKED AT ACHIEVING REGULATORY COMPLIANCE WITH RESPECT TO RELEASE OF UNTREATED SEWAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT
YOU0000001775_S0000725 MAINLY BASEMENT FLOODINGS AND OVERFLOWS
YOU0000001775_S0000733 SO KENT MENTIONED YOU GO FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS BETWEEN PLANS

YOU0000001775_S0003427 BUT WE REALLY DON'T HEAR BACK FROM A POINT PERSON AND IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT'S AN EMAIL THAT'S SENT TO ALL COUNCIL
YOU0000001775_S0003447 SO EVERYONE'S BEEN KIND OF STEPPING UP TRAINING HARD FOR IT
YOU0000001775_S0003467 THANK YOU

YOU0000001791_S0000214 BUT NOT WHEN I'M TOXIC IN APEX
YOU0000001799_S0000026 EXCELLENT
YOU0000001799_S0000069 THIS IS WHERE THE PERSON SIGNED UP
YOU0000001799_S0000109 CHAT
YOU0000001799_S0000175 BUT THEN YOU COULD ATTACH IT RIGHT TO THE COMMENTS FOR THAT PARTICULAR STUDENT
YOU0000001799_S0000186 IT'S ALWAYS FUN
YOU0000001807_S0000012 I HAVE SOME IMAGES HERE OF STUDENTS ENGAGING IN A FACE-TO-FACE CLASS AND MANY STUDENTS ON ELECTRONIC DEVICES
YOU0000001807_S0000019 WHEN OUR STUDENTS ARE IN THE ONLINE ENVIRONMENT
YOU0000001807_S0000024 OKAY SO THE FIRST POLLING QUESTION SHOULD BE UP
YOU0000001807_S0000032 WOW OKAY SO WE HAVE A LOT OF FACULTY HERE TODAY
YOU0000001807_S0000041 OKAY SO HERE IS I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S PULLING UP BOTH OF THEM BUT WE'VE ANSWERED THE FIRST QUESTION ALREADY SO LET'S JUST DO THE SECOND QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE UP FOR EVERYONE
YOU0000001807_S0000048 A HURDLE TO GET OVER RIGHT
YOU0000001807_S0000055 AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE A LAYOUT CAN MAKE RIGHT
YOU0000001807_S0000060 THE BLOCK OF TEXT ON THE RIGHT THERE IS MORE INVITING IT'S EASIER TO READ
YOU0000001807_S0000068 HELPS TO SKIM THE PAGE MORE QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY
YOU0000001807_S0000079 TO ILLUSTRATE ITEMS IN A GROUP
YOU0000001807_S0000084 IN ORDER TO BETTER CHUNK OUR CONTENT WE'LL BE GOING OVER HOW TO USE THE RICH CONTENT EDITOR FOR SUCCESSFUL PAGE DESIGN
YOU0000001807_S0000090 SO TO GET STARTED
YOU0000001807_S0000102 OR RIGHT FOR YOUR PARAGRAPHS YOU CAN INDENT
YOU0000001807_S0000110 THIS HEADING TWO
YOU0000001807_S0000115 ANOTHER GREAT TOOL SHOWN HERE IS CREATING LISTS WHICH ARE GREAT FOR CREATING
YOU0000001807_S0000124 THEN OTHER DESIGN ELEMENTS LIKE TABS ARE GREAT
YOU0000001807_S0000133 THERE'S A PIECE OF CODE THAT YOU CAN COPY AND PASTE TO CREATE MORE TABS
YOU0000001807_S0000142 WHICH WILL HOLD THE REST OF YOUR CODE FOR YOU
YOU0000001807_S0000147 IF YOU HEAR ME SAY TAG IN THIS PRESENTATION I AM REFERENCING A PIECE OF CODE THAT HAS THE LITTLE PACMAN OR ANGLE BRACKET
YOU0000001807_S0000155 SO WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE NEXT FEW LINES OF CODE
YOU0000001807_S0000166 IF YOU LOOK AT THE IMAGE ON THE RIGHT
YOU0000001807_S0000173 NOW YOU MAY BE THINKING WHAT'S A FRAGMENT
YOU0000001807_S0000179 JUST BECAUSE IT WILL LOOK YOU KNOW REALLY CROWDED AND CAN BE CONFUSING LIKE WE SAW EARLIER
YOU0000001807_S0000186 SO NEXT WE NEED A PLACE TO PUT OUR CONTENT FOR OUR TABS THAT WE'VE CREATED
YOU0000001807_S0000191 SO THIS IS WHERE YOU'LL TYPE YOUR CONTENT OF WHAT YOU WANT TO APPEAR IN THE TAB
YOU0000001807_S0000197 LOOKING AT THIS CODE
YOU0000001807_S0000203 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
YOU0000001807_S0000211 AND I'LL SHOW YOU LIVE HOW TO ADD A TAB TO YOUR CONTENT PAGE
YOU0000001807_S0000216 WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO EDIT
YOU0000001807_S0000223 AND WE HAVE OUR FRAGMENT TWO
YOU0000001807_S0000229 THEN WE HAVE I'M GOING TO SEPARATE THIS CODE SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO SEE
YOU0000001807_S0000234 AND I'M GOING TO COPY THIS DIV AND THE CLOSING DIV ABOVE IT
YOU0000001807_S0000243 CLOSING
YOU0000001807_S0000250 AND IT'S STILL GOING TO SHOW UP IN YOUR TABS
YOU0000001807_S0000262 SO
YOU0000001807_S0000276 SO ANOTHER QUESTION IS SHOULD TABS BE USED ON THE MODULE PAGE
YOU0000001807_S0000289 GO AHEAD AND
YOU0000001807_S0000299 IT'S NOT GOING TO SHOW UP AS TABS SO YOU DON'T WANT TO
YOU0000001807_S0000307 BUT JUST LIKE WITH TABS THE SAME CODE CAN BE USED TO CREATE SIX TEN TWENTY SECTIONS OF CONTENT IN YOUR ACCORDION
YOU0000001807_S0000316 JUST LIKE WE DID WITH THE TABS
YOU0000001807_S0000322 SO DON'T FORGET THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS PIECE OF CODE AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF WHERE YOU'RE STARTING YOUR ACCORDION OR YOUR TABS
YOU0000001807_S0000327 BUT THE IMAGE DOWN HERE IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE ON A MOBILE DEVICE
YOU0000001807_S0000333 I TOOK THIS CODE FROM A PAGE THAT HAD ANOTHER HEADING
YOU0000001807_S0000341 SO THE TAGS YOU'RE FRAGMENTING UP THE PAGE IN SECTIONS BY WIDTH AND HERE YOU'RE FRAGMENTING IT UP BY LENGTH
YOU0000001807_S0000350 AND THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING YOUR CONTENT
YOU0000001807_S0000356 YOU HAVE
YOU0000001807_S0000363 WHEREAS THIS ONE HAS ZERO PADDING ASSOCIATED WITH IT
YOU0000001807_S0000368 NOW YOUR CONTENT IS WRITTEN INSIDE OF HERE
YOU0000001807_S0000374 THEN BELOW THAT YOU HAVE THE DIV FOR THE CONTENT INSIDE OF THE ACCORDION WITH THE SAME PADDING APPLIED AS BEFORE
YOU0000001807_S0000380 FOR A TWO-LAYERED ACCORDION
YOU0000001807_S0000387 AND WE'LL GO INTO EDIT
YOU0000001807_S0000396 CAN'T FORGET THE DIV
YOU0000001807_S0000407 AND YOU HAVE ANOTHER PIECE TO YOUR ACCORDION
YOU0000001807_S0000429 I CAN GO BACK OVER THAT THOUGH
YOU0000001807_S0000440 AND WHAT WAS THE OTHER THING THAT YOU NEEDED TO BE SHOWN
YOU0000001807_S0000452 SO IT'S REALLY UP TO YOU AS FAR AS YOUR PARTICULAR STYLE AND THE CONTENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DELIVERING
YOU0000001807_S0000459 SO THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T PUT TOO MUCH CONTENT IN THERE
YOU0000001807_S0000471 ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHERE CAN I SEE ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES ON CANVAS
YOU0000001807_S0000482 SO BY USING THESE DESIGN ELEMENTS YOUR STUDENTS WILL BE LESS OVERWHELMED BY YOUR CONTENT PAGES AND MORE ENGAGED WITH YOUR CONTENT
YOU0000001807_S0000487 I ALSO WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WHICH AGAIN YOU'LL HAVE THIS POWERPOINT
YOU0000001807_S0000494 SO YOU HAVE THIS IS AGAIN THE SAME INFORMATION THE SAME CONTENT
YOU0000001807_S0000501 BECAUSE WHERE YOU PUT THE CODE IS WHERE IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP ON
YOU0000001807_S0000510 SO YOU HAVE THIS POP-UP WINDOW FOR FORMAT BUT
YOU0000001807_S0000517 SO IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK OUT SUPER WELL IN THAT ASPECT
YOU0000001807_S0000525 THIS IS YOUR HYPERLINK RIGHT
YOU0000001807_S0000534 LET'S SEE IS THERE A RULE HOW MANY LETTERS WORDS TO PUT IN A TAB
YOU0000001807_S0000544 SO THANKS FOR COMING TODAY EVERYBODY
YOU0000001807_S0000558 FOR INSTANCE THIS EXAMPLE HERE
YOU0000001807_S0000565 SO TO SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS
YOU0000001807_S0000575 ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YOU0000001815_S0000006 OPEN THE DOOR UP COMPLETELY
YOU0000001815_S0000012 ON THAT SPRING
YOU0000001815_S0000023 PULL THEM AWAY
YOU0000001815_S0000031 ATTACHES TO THE SMALL WAX MOTOR THAT STICKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT LATCH ASSEMBLY
YOU0000001815_S0000042 SHAPED EDGE ON THAT BELLOWS THAT FITS INTO THAT GROOVE
YOU0000001815_S0000051 AND MAKE SURE THE WIRE BAND FITS INTO THAT V GROOVE
YOU0000001815_S0000058 ONCE WE GOT THAT WIRE FIRMLY IN PLACE WE CAN CLOSE THE DOOR UP
YOU0000001825_S0000018 SUBSTANCE ABUSE
YOU0000001825_S0000031 A RARE BRAIN DISEASE
YOU0000001825_S0000041 I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTING AND DOING IMPROV AND STAND-UP COMEDY IMPROV IS WORKING OFF THINGS IN THE ROOM HE COULD WORK OFF ANYTHING
YOU0000001825_S0000053 THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE END AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THE END
YOU0000001833_S0001068 IF
YOU0000001841_S0000006 THIS SHORT BLOCK IS THE CREATION OF BLUEPRINT ENGINES AND IT'S MADE RIGHT HERE IN THE U S A
YOU0000001841_S0000012 YOU HAVE SEEN US RUN BLUEPRINT ENGINES IN THE PAST AND IT'S FOR GOOD REASON THEY'RE WELL DESIGNED
YOU0000001841_S0000018 WE FIRED IT UP
YOU0000001841_S0000027 ELIZA AND JEREMY ARE WORKING ON A CLASSIC PIECE OF AMERICAN OFF ROADING AND IT NEEDS SOME STOUT HORSEPOWER
YOU0000001841_S0000043 AND FOR THE APPLICATION DOWN IN X O R WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE A BUNCH MORE POWER THAN THIS ENGINE IS CURRENTLY SETUP TO MAKE WHICH MEANS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE OUT A FEW PARTS
YOU0000001841_S0000054 BUT IT WON'T WORK WITH THE ROD THAT CAME IN THIS ENGINE THAT'S WHY WE'RE SWITCHING TO THE EAGLE HERE IS A QUICK LOOK HOW WE CAME UP WITH THE CALCULATION OF WHAT WE NEEDED TO USE
YOU0000001841_S0000063 AND WE HAVE A TOTAL LENGTH OF TEN POINT ONE NINE FIVE INCHES
YOU0000001841_S0000070 THEN WE ROCK THE PISTON BACK AND FORTH FINDING THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST POINT IN THE BORE AT T D C
YOU0000001841_S0000076 BECAUSE THE WRIST PIN'S BORE INTERSECTS THE RING LAND ON THE OIL RING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RUN A SUPPORT RAIL AND IT IS HELD IN PLACE BY THIS MARK THAT KEEPS IT FROM ROTATING IT SUPPORTS THE OIL RING TO KEEP IT FROM BURNING EXCESSIVE OIL
YOU0000001841_S0000082 AND A FEELER GAUGE IS USED TO CHECK THE GAP
YOU0000001841_S0000088 WELCOME BACK TO ENGINE POWER
YOU0000001841_S0000096 WHICH ON MOST FASTENERS IS SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ITS YIELD
YOU0000001841_S0000101 THE SPECS ARE IMPRESSIVE BY ANY STANDARDS
YOU0000001841_S0000109 THE CAM SHAFT THRUST PLATE SLIDES IN AND IS TORQUED TO NINETY SIX POUND INCHES OR EIGHT POUND FEET
YOU0000001841_S0000116 OUR SOLID ROLLER LIFTERS ARE FROM COMP CAM'S PREMIUM SPORTSMAN SERIES
YOU0000001841_S0000123 THEN WE'LL LENGTHEN THE ADJUSTABLE PUSH ROD WHILE THE CAM IS ON BASE CIRCLE UNTIL WE HAVE THE CORRECT LASH

YOU0000001841_S0000137 SINCE EVERYTHING IS TORQUED UP AND READY TO GO
YOU0000001841_S0000148 NOW STUDS WILL HELP SO YOU CAN ALIGN IT
YOU0000001841_S0000162 WHEN BUILDING ANY ENGINE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER IS COMPRESSION RATIO
YOU0000001841_S0000168 THEY ARE NUMBER ONE THE SWEPT VOLUME OF THE CYLINDER IF YOU CHANGE THE BORE OR STROKE OF A CYLINDER YOU WILL CHANGE THE VOLUME OF THAT CYLINDER AND THEREFORE IT'S COMPRESSION RATIO NUMBER TWO COMBUSTION CHAMBER SIZE
YOU0000001841_S0000173 NUMBER FOUR THE VOLUME OF THE CYLINDER AT T D C WITH NO OTHER COMPONENTS
YOU0000001841_S0000180 NOW YOU KNOW THE FIVE FACTORS THAT DETERMINE ENGINE COMPRESSION RATIO
YOU0000001849_S0001311 NOT TOO

YOU0000001857_S0000294 THEREFORE IN ADVOCACY OF MY STUDENTS
YOU0000001857_S0000299 SO YOU CAN NOT BASE YOUR DECISION SOLELY BASED OFF OF THAT
YOU0000001857_S0000307 THESE STAFF MEMBERS WHO VOLUNTEERED TO BE PRESENT SHOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR THAT AS WELL

YOU0000001857_S0000486 I KNOW THERE'S NO PERFECT SOLUTION GIVEN OUR BUDGET REALITIES BUT I THINK WE CAN AND WE MUST FIND EQUITABLE STANDARDS FOR SAFETY
YOU0000001857_S0000492 WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND OUR SCHOOLS ARE OVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS SHORT TO SAFELY FUND A FIFTY PERCENT RETURN TO SCHOOL PLAN
YOU0000001857_S0000497 WE NEED OUR SCHOOL BOARD TO LEAD TONIGHT

YOU0000001857_S0000511 YES SIR
YOU0000001857_S0000521 BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE AMAZING EDUCATORS ESPECIALLY IN SPECIAL EDUCATION THAT I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW THROUGH MY CHILDREN AND STEPPED UP
YOU0000001857_S0000528 I ASK WHATEVER THE FINAL VOTE IS THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD AND LEADERS ALL CONTINUE TO DO THEIR BEST TO REMAIN TRANSPARENT
YOU0000001857_S0000538 WITH THAT I WISH YOU ALL WELL AND I SUPPORT YOU AND OUR COMMUNITY AS WE LOOK FORWARD FOR ALL STUDENTS GOING BACK TO IN-PERSON INSTRUCTION ONE DAY

YOU0000001857_S0000559 WITH EXCELLENT TIME MANAGEMENT SKILLS
YOU0000001857_S0000569 I MEAN THEIR CLASS DISCUSSIONS SOCRATIC SEMINARS DEBATES AND TEACHERS THEMSELVES CAN NOT BE REPLACED BY RECORDED CONTENT
YOU0000001857_S0000574 HELLO

YOU0000001857_S0000631 MY NAME IS ABDULLAH USUFZAI AND I'M A RISING JUNIOR AT BATTLEFIELD HIGH SCHOOL
YOU0000001857_S0000637 FIRST AND FOREMOST MANY INDIVIDUALS FACE SITUATIONS THAT MAKE IT UNSAFE FOR THEM TO ATTEND THE SCHOOL BUILDING FOR THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR
YOU0000001857_S0000642 OFFICE HOURS AND MOTIVATION IN A SCHOOLHOUSE ENVIRONMENT
YOU0000001857_S0000648 I ADVOCATE THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD APPROVES PLAN ONE OR THE ALL VIRTUAL MODEL
YOU0000001857_S0000653 THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT HERE IN PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY
YOU0000001857_S0000658 FUNDING THAT WILL NOT BE USED FOR KEEPING SCHOOL BUILDINGS OPEN CAN BE ALLOCATED TOWARDS PROVIDING COMPUTERS
YOU0000001857_S0000663 ULTIMATELY SCHOOLS SHOULD NOT BE USED AS POLITICAL FOOTBALLS AS MOST ADULTS ARE DOING THESE DAYS
YOU0000001857_S0000668 AND QUALITY OF EDUCATION FIRST
YOU0000001857_S0000677 OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST SIX MONTHS I'VE SEEN THE PUBLIC'S VIEW OF MY ROLE SHIFT FROM AN EDUCATOR TO A BABYSITTER AND NOW A SACRIFICIAL LAMB
YOU0000001857_S0000682 TODAY I'M ADVOCATING FOR MY LIFE AND MY STUDENT'S LIFE
YOU0000001857_S0000689 MOST SCHOOLS WITHIN PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR THAT ATTEND SCHOOL
YOU0000001857_S0000695 WE CAN ALWAYS START OFF VIRTUALLY AND THEN SWITCHED TO IN-PERSON
YOU0000001857_S0000701 NO LUNCHROOM EATING
YOU0000001857_S0000706 AS A SCHOOL BOARD THAT WHEN VIRTUAL UNTIL IT'S SAFE OR THE BOARD THAT THEIR STUDENTS STAFF AND TEACHERS INTO A BUILDING WITH ACCEPTABLE LOSSES
YOU0000001857_S0000713 YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR MICROPHONE
YOU0000001857_S0000724 AND I'D ALSO ASK THAT ARE THE SCHOOL GUIDELINES MATCH THE STATE GUIDELINES RIGHT NOW THE STATE IS OPENING UP IN LARGE MEASURES

YOU0000001857_S0000789 I'M A PARENT OF AN ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOLER
YOU0000001857_S0000794 THE LATEST NUMBERS FROM THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SHOW THAT TWELVE PERCENT OF THE COUNTY'S CASES ARE CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO NINETEEN
YOU0000001857_S0000802 THIS ISN'T ABOUT TAKING A HIGHER RISK
YOU0000001857_S0000807 THERE'S NO NORMAL AND THE STRESSORS FOR KIDS AND STAFF TO MAINTAIN DISTANCE AND EFFECTIVE HEALTH MEASURES WILL OVERRULE ANY POSITIVE GAINS FROM TWO DAYS OF IN-PERSON ATTENDANCE
YOU0000001857_S0000812 YES THERE WILL BE CHALLENGES
YOU0000001857_S0000820 YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR MICROPHONE JAMILA GALT
YOU0000001857_S0000827 AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE DISPARITIES WITHIN DIFFERENT RACIAL GROUPS I FIND NO ADDITIONAL COMFORT IN BEING BLACK FORTY AND IN GOOD HEALTH BECAUSE I'M STAYING AT HOME

YOU0000001857_S0000848 I WORK IN THE HOME HEALTH SETTING AND I HAVE PROVIDED CARE TO COVID PATIENTS BOTH IN THEIR HOMES AND IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES AND INDEPENDENT FACILITIES

YOU0000001857_S0000987 I HAVE THREE KIDS ATTENDING PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY SCHOOLS SEVENTH FIFTH GRADE AND ENTERING KINDERGARTEN
YOU0000001857_S0000993 THIS WAY OUR TEACHERS STAFF AND STUDENTS ARE SAFE AND TEACHERS ALSO HAVE TIME TO FOCUS ON VIRTUAL LEARNING AND NOT BEING THROWN INTO A HECTIC SCHEDULE OF MANAGING BOTH VIRTUAL AND IN-CLASS TEACHING
YOU0000001857_S0000999 IN CLOSING I ASK YOU TO PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY SCHOOLS

YOU0000001857_S0001148 SO I'LL MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH THOSE
YOU0000001857_S0001154 AND SO THE PRESENTATION IS BASED ON WHERE WE LEFT OFF LAST WEDNESDAY
YOU0000001857_S0001165 AND AGAIN I'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT WITH THE FIFTY PERCENT MODEL WHERE YOU LANDED AT THE END OF THE MEETING
YOU0000001857_S0001171 AND THEY DID AN AVERAGE SCHOOL SYSTEM IN AMERICA THERE ARE ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND SCHOOL SYSTEMS
YOU0000001857_S0001179 MITIGATES THE HEALTH RISK TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE
YOU0000001857_S0001186 NUMBER FOUR THIS MODEL ALLOWS FLEXIBILITY TO REVERT TO AN ALL VIRTUAL HOUSE OR RETURN TO NORMAL EITHER WAY
YOU0000001857_S0001192 ALL STAFF AND STUDENTS MUST WEAR FACE COVERINGS THE MAJORITY OF THE DAY INCLUDING ON SCHOOL BUSES
YOU0000001857_S0001199 A MINIMUM OF THREE FEET OF PHYSICAL DISTANCE
YOU0000001857_S0001207 BUT THERE MIGHT BE SCHOOLS IF IT'S NOT USING THIS SPACE FOR SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE ABLE TO USE AT LEAST PART OF A LUNCH ROOM
YOU0000001857_S0001213 THOSE BENEFITS PROVIDE FOR TEN WORK DAYS
YOU0000001857_S0001219 NUMBER TWO IS JUST A REMINDER THAT AS OF RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF ADMINISTERING A SURVEY TO SEE WHAT PARENTS MIGHT WANT TO OPT OUT AND DO A TOTAL IN-PERSON VERSUS A TOTAL ONLINE SO OPTING OUT OF IN-PERSON ONTO ONLINE
YOU0000001857_S0001228 I ALSO WANNA REASSURE EVERYONE THAT I'VE BEEN REASSURED MYSELF THAT THE DEEP CLEANING THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE THAT ON WEDNESDAY
YOU0000001857_S0001238 WE CAN DO THAT ON A LIMITED BASIS
YOU0000001857_S0001247 SO THIS IS A VIDEO
YOU0000001857_S0001255 BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT IT WAS VIRTUAL
YOU0000001857_S0001261 THANK YOU
YOU0000001857_S0001271 RESULT WILL PROVIDE FEEDBACK FOR YOU
YOU0000001857_S0001278 IT WILL MAKE THE LEARNING PROCESS FOR STUDENTS RUN SMOOTHER SO HAVING EVERYTHING IN ONE PLACE MAKES THE LEARNING AND TEACHING EXPERIENCE RUN BETTER
YOU0000001857_S0001286 AND THEN YOU HAVE STUDENTS GOING
YOU0000001857_S0001294 SO SIMILARLY PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW WELL WHAT IS THIS LIKE WHAT DOES A SCHEDULE PERHAPS LOOK LIKE
YOU0000001857_S0001300 AND THIS SHOWS YOU AGAIN
YOU0000001857_S0001311 NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
YOU0000001857_S0001317 NEXT SLIDE
YOU0000001857_S0001326 SO THERE'S ALSO SOME ADDITIONAL MITIGATION FOR ELEMENTARY STUDENTS JUST BY VIRTUE OF THE HEIGHT OF THE SEATS
YOU0000001857_S0001333 IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO OPEN SCHOOL TONIGHT
YOU0000001857_S0001341 MR WELK
YOU0000001857_S0001348 WE'LL OPEN THE FLOOR FOR DISCUSSION
YOU0000001857_S0001353 FEELINGS ON THE RETURN TO LEARN PLAN FOR THIS UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR
YOU0000001857_S0001359 HOWEVER AT THIS POINT IN TIME I ALSO STRONGLY FEEL THAT IT IS TOO EARLY TO GIVE UP PLANNING FOR A PERSONAL IN-PERSON OPTION
YOU0000001857_S0001366 THE CHAIR AND GROUP WILL PERMIT IF THIS HAS PASSED
YOU0000001857_S0001371 CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS
YOU0000001857_S0001378 I CAN LIST THE MANY INITIATIVES THAT I'VE HELPED LEAD TO HELP IMPROVE THEIR LIVES
YOU0000001857_S0001383 I BELIEVE THE DIVISION NEEDS TO PREPARE FOR BOTH OPTIONS THERE IS NO REASON WHY THIS CAN'T HAPPEN AS WE WAIT FOR REVISED CDC GUIDELINES AND THE ACTUAL DATA AND CASE STUDIES ON WHAT OCCURS IN STATES STARTING TO OPEN IN EARLY AUGUST
YOU0000001857_S0001389 IT IS NOT A WASTE TO PLAN FOR THIS TIME OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO PUT OUR STUDENTS IN SCHOOL
YOU0000001857_S0001395 WHEN I LED THE CHARGE TO OVERTURN THE EXTENDED CONTRACT PASSED BY THE PREVIOUS BOARD
YOU0000001857_S0001401 I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT MY ULTIMATE INTENTION IS TO LOOKOUT FOR THE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS OF THIS COUNTY
YOU0000001857_S0001406 AGAIN NO STUDENT OR TEACHER WILL EVER ENTER SCHOOL UNDER MY VIEW WITH THIS IDEA AND PLAN
YOU0000001857_S0001411 AS MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING FORMER COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS HAVE ACCUSED ME OF OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS BECAUSE MY VIEW HAS BEEN PUBLIC FOR THE LAST WEEK
YOU0000001857_S0001420 SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ALL THE HARD WORK THAT WENT INTO THAT
YOU0000001857_S0001429 SO ONE OF THE GREATEST MERITS OF THE FIFTY PERCENT HYBRID PLAN IS THAT IT GIVES PARENTS A CHOICE FOR THOSE PARENTS WHO DESPERATELY NEED TEACHERS TO HELP THEM SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN
YOU0000001857_S0001440 WE CAN ALL BE WEARING MASKS AND WE CAN BE WEARING YOU KNOW KEEPING APART FROM EACH OTHER WE CAN STILL DO SOME OF THOSE ACTIVITIES THE THINGS THAT KIDS LOVE
YOU0000001857_S0001450 ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF THIS HYBRID MODEL IS THAT WE CAN ADVOCATE AND CARE FOR THOSE CHILDREN AND GET THEM THE HELP THAT THEY NEED
YOU0000001857_S0001466 AND I KNOW THAT TEACHERS HAVE EXPRESSED LOUD AND CLEAR THEIR THOUGHTS ON THAT
YOU0000001857_S0001477 I REALLY LOVE HOW YOU YOU POINTED OUT SO MANY THINGS IN THE PLAN TO RETURN AT FIFTY PERCENT AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY TRUE
YOU0000001857_S0001483 BUT I AM VERY WORRIED ABOUT HOW MANY OF OUR STUDENTS WILL BE IN THE BUILDINGS
YOU0000001857_S0001488 I JUST DON'T WANNA PUT SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THEM
YOU0000001857_S0001495 BUT I THINK WE NEED TO WORK TOWARD THAT
YOU0000001857_S0001503 IT IS THE FACT THAT WE ARE UNDERFUNDED
YOU0000001857_S0001511 I AM CONCERNED ABOUT MASK COMPLIANCE WITHIN MY COMMUNITY
YOU0000001857_S0001523 THEY CAN BETTER PLAN
YOU0000001857_S0001532 PLEASE UNMUTE MS RAULSTON THANKS
YOU0000001857_S0001538 DR LATEEF CAN I GO SURE WHILE MS RAULSTON WORKS ON OUR TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WE'LL GO WITH MS LILLIE JESSIE
YOU0000001857_S0001545 I HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN AND THE PEDIATRICS ASSOCIATION AND VARIOUS PEOPLE AND WHAT THEIR VIEWS ARE ABOUT CHILDREN'S SAFETY I HEARD NOBODY TALK ABOUT ADULT SAFETY
YOU0000001857_S0001556 AND YET TONIGHT
YOU0000001857_S0001562 FIRST OF ALL I WANTED TO THANK TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE
YOU0000001857_S0001567 PLEASE FORGIVE ME
YOU0000001857_S0001572 AND PRIVATELY HELD SECRETS WITH US
YOU0000001857_S0001578 I'M HONORED THAT YOU CHOSE TO SHARE YOUR HEARTS AND SOUL WITH ME
YOU0000001857_S0001586 THE LATTER DID SEND CONCERNS WITH THE CARRIER THE BUS DRIVER SENT CONCERNS TO ME
YOU0000001857_S0001595 I HOPE THAT HAPPENS FOR ME TONIGHT
YOU0000001857_S0001602 AND MEMBERS
YOU0000001857_S0001607 THAT COMES WITH A VERY CENTRAL MANTRA THAT I'VE HEARD THROUGH THESE TWO HUNDRED EMAILS OR SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
YOU0000001857_S0001612 NUMBER ONE WE'RE SCARED
YOU0000001857_S0001617 BUT KNOW THAT THEY CAN NOT FULLY ENFORCE THE DISTANCING AND MITIGATION STRATEGY WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT
YOU0000001857_S0001624 HAVE SUCH DIRE CONSEQUENCES AS ARE SHOWN TO US
YOU0000001857_S0001631 AND YOU GAVE US TO ADVOCATE FOR OUR HOME SAFETY

YOU0000001857_S0001672 AFTER THOSE PEOPLE TAKE THAT RISKY VACATION TRIP
YOU0000001857_S0001678 YET THIS IS NOT THE SAME TEACHING SITUATION WE'VE HAD BEFORE PEOPLE

YOU0000001857_S0001725 I THOUGHT WE UNMUTED IT
YOU0000001857_S0001733 I THINK IT WAS LIKE TEN OR FIFTEEN AND IT WASN'T FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE BUT TO BRING PEOPLE TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
YOU0000001857_S0001739 THE ACTUAL WORKINGS THAT YOU DO ALL THE TIME
YOU0000001857_S0001744 THEY LIKE THAT
YOU0000001857_S0001752 GOOD WORDS

YOU0000001857_S0001856 THAT'S A GOOD SAMPLE SIZE AS I SAID BEFORE I'M NOT A STATISTICIAN BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IF I WAS TAKING A CLASS THEY'D SAY IT WAS A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE
YOU0000001857_S0001865 I HAVE GOOD HEALTH INSURANCE OR WHAT IS CONSIDERED TO BE HEALTH INSURANCE
YOU0000001857_S0001870 THAT CAN STILL BE DONE VIRTUALLY

YOU0000001857_S0001908 IT'S PEOPLE WHO DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH BECAUSE THAT IS STILL PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK ENGLISH AND COMMUNICATE EVERYONE CAN'T DO THAT AS WE HEARD TONIGHT FROM A STUDENT WHO CALLED IN ON BEHALF OF HER PARENTS
YOU0000001857_S0001914 WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT ENOUGH BUT IT'S IMPORTANT
YOU0000001857_S0001919 I HAVE A SEVEN YEAR OLD HE WEARS A MASK HE DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT
YOU0000001857_S0001927 HOW FAR APART YOUR SPACING IS
YOU0000001857_S0001933 I ABSOLUTELY ENCOURAGE IT OUR SCHOOL DIVISION
YOU0000001857_S0001940 DEALING WITH IT IN THEIR OWN HOUSES
YOU0000001857_S0001946 IF YOU DON'T GIVE THEM THE SKILLS TO INTERACT WITH THEIR STUDENTS AND RECOGNIZE THE TRAUMA THAT THEY ARE FACING
YOU0000001857_S0001951 ACROSS ALL SCHOOLS
YOU0000001857_S0001957 I CAN'T SUPPORT THE FIFTY FIFTY
YOU0000001857_S0001962 WHILE I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WILL HAVE BUDGETARY EFFECTS
YOU0000001857_S0001968 PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT NO MATTER WHAT LIST WHAT WE CRUST
YOU0000001857_S0001973 SO WITH THAT
YOU0000001857_S0001979 IT IS CLEAR
YOU0000001857_S0001988 THIS IS NOT AN EASY DECISION
YOU0000001857_S0001994 YOUR EMOTION
YOU0000001857_S0001999 AND THIS DISCUSSION REGARDLESS OF HOW THIS VOTE GOES
YOU0000001857_S0002004 WE HAVE CHOSEN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS TO SIFT THROUGH THE DATA
YOU0000001857_S0002012 AND SO
YOU0000001857_S0002023 AS WE CONTINUE TO GET FURTHER GUIDELINES FROM THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WELL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
YOU0000001857_S0002032 THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ISSUED GUIDANCE
YOU0000001857_S0002038 WE COULD EASILY DO THAT FOR SWIMMING
YOU0000001857_S0002047 I THINK THOSE THAT CAN WORK FROM HOME
YOU0000001857_S0002056 WHEN A PATIENT COMES TO ME FOR A SURGICAL PROCEDURE WE DISCUSSED THE RISKS AND BENEFITS EVEN THOUGH COMPLICATIONS ARE RARE WE OFFER A PERCENTAGE
YOU0000001857_S0002066 I DON'T HAVE A HEALTH METRIC I'VE NOT HEARD ONE SAY A HEALTH METRIC THAT WE SHOULD USE THE CDC AND HEALTH EXPERTS WHO SIFT THROUGH THIS DATA
YOU0000001857_S0002074 SAFETY
YOU0000001857_S0002079 SO IT DOESN'T COLLAPSE
YOU0000001857_S0002084 I CAN'T DO IT THEY'VE ALL SAID
YOU0000001857_S0002091 SPENT HOURS OVER THERE ASKING FOR THEM IN THE SECOND ROUND OF BUDGETING
YOU0000001857_S0002098 I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE TO DO WITH THEM AND I ASKED THE PUBLIC WHO IS EXTRAORDINARILY CONCERNED WELL WHAT DECISION WE MAKE TONIGHT AND MOVE FORWARD
YOU0000001857_S0002103 WHEN THEN CAN WE EXPECT THEM TO SPEND ON EDUCATION
YOU0000001857_S0002112 MAYBE
YOU0000001857_S0002119 WE NEED THAT DATA NO MATTER WHAT WE DECIDE
YOU0000001857_S0002128 AND THE BOARD KNOWS THAT WE ARE UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE TO DELIVER THAT THEN THE STAFF KNOWS THAT AND THEY ARE UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE TO DELIVER THAT AND IF THEY DON'T DELIVER THAT THAT IS ON ALL OF US
YOU0000001857_S0002137 AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE THIS VOTE WE WILL MOVE FORWARD WHATEVER COMPROMISE OR NECESSITY WE NEED TO DO
YOU0000001857_S0002143 I JUST WANTED TO DIRECT EVERYONE'S ATTENTION THIS IS THE SECOND SLIDE TONIGHT OF NUMBER ONE

YOU0000001917_S0000016 BOATS
YOU0000001917_S0000022 AND EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW HOW TO DRAW A CASTLE
YOU0000001917_S0000028 IT'S JUST FUN TO EXPLORE AND SEE WHAT KINDS OF THINGS CAN COME OUT OF FORCING YOURSELF TO STICK WITH ONE OF THESE SOLIDS AND SEE WHAT KINDS OF REALISTIC IMAGES YOU CAN GET

YOU0000001933_S0000040 HIRING PEOPLE
YOU0000001933_S0000054 IT'S CERTAINLY HELPFUL
YOU0000001933_S0000077 AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I WATCH REGULARLY
YOU0000001933_S0000090 I DON'T RECOMMEND DOING THAT UNTIL YOU'VE STARTED TO GET SOME DATA INTO YOUR ACCOUNT WHICH MEANS ACTIVITY RIGHT IMPRESSIONS AND CLICKS
YOU0000001933_S0000099 OR YOU'RE NOT BIDDING HIGH ENOUGH ON YOUR COST PER CLICK
YOU0000001933_S0000110 IT'LL START TO ADJUST ITSELF
YOU0000001933_S0000119 AGAIN
YOU0000001933_S0000129 JUST GO TO GOOGLE AND SEARCH ALPHA BETA CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE OR GOOGLE ADS ALPHA BETA CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE YOU'LL SEE A PDF
YOU0000001933_S0000138 SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YOU0000001933_S0000147 WHAT THE HELL'S THE GUY'S NAME THAT WROTE THE PERRY
YOU0000001933_S0000155 WHENEVER I'VE BEEN RUNNING LEAD GENERATION CAMPAIGNS USING GOOGLE ADS
YOU0000001933_S0000167 YOU STILL CAN USE IT IF YOU DESIRE TO BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY
YOU0000001933_S0000178 BUT OR TO THOSE INSTEAD OF DIRECT TO THE MONEY SITE AND IT PROTECTS OUR MONEY SITE BUT LIKE I SAID IF YOU'RE RUNNING YOUR OWN BUSINESS
YOU0000001933_S0000197 HIGHLY COMPETITIVE NICHE WELL ON MAY TEN
YOU0000001933_S0000207 WE HAVE PEOPLE KILLING IT EITHER WAY THAT YOU DO IT
YOU0000001933_S0000225 TO CREATE IT AND OR CLAIM IT
YOU0000001933_S0000234 BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE A PHYSICAL ADDRESS
YOU0000001933_S0000245 SO IT HAS TO BE THE SAME WELL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START BUILDING CITATIONS TO A LOCATION
YOU0000001933_S0000259 AS I'VE TOLD THEM LISTEN
YOU0000001933_S0000267 I'VE GIVEN THEM BUSINESS CARDS OR I'VE OFFERED TO PAY FOR THE NEXT TIME THEY GET THEIR PAPER INVOICES PRINTED
YOU0000001933_S0000276 THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THE LPL
YOU0000001933_S0000284 IF IT'S YOUR OWN ACCOUNTS
YOU0000001933_S0000291 BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN THINK ABOUT LIKE IN YOUR OWN TOWN DIFFERENT BUSINESSES THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO LIKE OR DISLIKE
YOU0000001933_S0000304 WHEN SET UP
YOU0000001933_S0000312 SO WHAT I RECOMMEND IS IF YOU JUST TARGET ONE INDUSTRY YOU ONLY HAVE TO DO KEYWORD RESEARCH ONCE
YOU0000001933_S0000324 BUT THEN I FOUND OUT IF YOU HAVE TOO MANY LOCATIONS TOO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER
YOU0000001933_S0000330 YOU KNOW HALF OF THEM WOULD END UP GETTING FILTERED OUT AND IT'S NOT THAT YOU CAN'T GET THAT FILTER LIFTED
YOU0000001933_S0000342 GOTCHA OKAY SO IT'S STILL PLAYING TOO SO EVERYONE CAN HEAR US SO THAT'S GOOD WEIRD
YOU0000001933_S0000356 OKAY THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO
YOU0000001933_S0000373 THAT'S TRUE
YOU0000001933_S0000391 MARCO THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THAT RIGHT
YOU0000001933_S0000400 IF THE ADDRESS IS HIDDEN THAT YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT
YOU0000001933_S0000408 YEAH WE GOT TIME LET'S DO THIS

YOU0000001933_S0000466 REDIRECT DETECTIVE
YOU0000001933_S0000489 AND YOU COPY THAT AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT YOU SHOULD BUILD LINKS TO
YOU0000001933_S0000504 RIGHT DOES THAT MAKE SENSE SO I JUST KIND OF WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT
YOU0000001933_S0000511 ANALYSIS FOR CLIENT YES THEY ARE PAYING ME FOR THIS SERVICE
YOU0000001933_S0000517 WHICH I THINK BY DEFAULT THEY ARE
YOU0000001933_S0000527 IF YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE AN INDEX IF YOU LEAVE IN A NO INDEX IT DOESN'T MATTER
YOU0000001933_S0000537 TODD SAYS HEY GUYS I'M WORKING WITH AN ESSENTIAL OILS COMPANY WHO DOES MOST OF THEIR BUSINESS AT POP UP THIS AT FESTIVALS
YOU0000001933_S0000554 OR THAT YOU VISIT OR DELIVER
YOU0000001933_S0000563 WHERE THEY ACTUALLY DELIVER THE PRODUCT TO THE CUSTOMER
YOU0000001933_S0000574 I'M GLAD YOU GOT THAT RESOLVED
YOU0000001933_S0000584 YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE JUST LEAD IF THEY'RE JUST SPAMMED ADDRESSES IS WHAT I'M SAYING
YOU0000001933_S0000590 YOU KNOW HOW SIMILAR THEY ARE IF IT'S ALL THE SAME BUSINESS NAME THEN I WOULD SAY DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKELY GOING TO HAVE SOME THAT ARE GOING TO GET PIGEON FILTERED
YOU0000001933_S0000606 I WOULDN'T PUSH THAT REAL HARD THOUGH IF YOU'RE ALREADY DOING WELL
YOU0000001933_S0000621 TO NEW PHONE NUMBER
YOU0000001941_S0000004 WE HEAR

YOU0000001941_S0000030 IT HAPPENS IF WE'RE PAYING ATTENTION BUT THE SOUNDS AREN'T REACHING OUR EARS
YOU0000001941_S0000038 YOU CAN STILL HEAR SOUNDS WHEN YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION

YOU0000001967_S0000110 HELLO
YOU0000001967_S0000176 THAT'S MINE
YOU0000001967_S0000236 OK
YOU0000001967_S0000336 NEED TO
YOU0000001967_S0000378 THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM
YOU0000001967_S0000396 AND THIS WAS MY LONG BORING STORY
YOU0000001967_S0000406 WHERE ARE WE WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS IS TERRIBLE
YOU0000001967_S0000437 SIR LAUNDRY
YOU0000001967_S0000459 ROOM SERVICE SIR
YOU0000001967_S0000508 NINE EIGHT TWO ZERO THREE FOUR FIVE TWO SEVEN NINE
YOU0000001967_S0000549 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YOU0000001975_S0000016 BUT A WAR WITH THE FRENCH BROKE OUT DIVERTING THE ATTENTION OF THE POPE AND MICHELANGELO FLED FROM ROME TO CONTINUE SCULPTING
YOU0000001975_S0000024 MANY WRITERS CONSIDER THAT MICHELANGELO HAD THE INTELLECT THE BIBLICAL KNOWLEDGE AND THE POWERS OF INVENTION TO HAVE DEVISED THE SCHEME HIMSELF
YOU0000001975_S0000033 THE HOLES WERE RE-USED TO HOLD SCAFFOLDING IN THE LATEST RESTORATION
YOU0000001975_S0000038 THE PAINTING TECHNIQUE EMPLOYED WAS FRESCO IN WHICH THE PAINT IS APPLIED TO DAMP PLASTER
YOU0000001975_S0000043 BECAUSE HE WAS PAINTING FRESCO THE PLASTER WAS LAID IN A NEW SECTION EVERY DAY CALLED A GIORNATA
YOU0000001975_S0000048 HIS ENERGETIC SWEEPING OUTLINES CAN BE SEEN SCRAPED INTO SOME OF THE SURFACES WHILE ON OTHERS A GRID IS EVIDENT INDICATING THAT HE ENLARGED DIRECTLY ONTO THE CEILING FROM A SMALL DRAWING
YOU0000001975_S0000053 THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER WHICH DEALS WITH THE FATE OF HUMANITY BUT ALSO BECAUSE ALL THE FIGURES AT THAT END OF THE CEILING INCLUDING THE PROPHETS AND IGNUDI ARE SMALLER THAN IN THE CENTRAL SECTION
YOU0000001975_S0000061 FIXED ON MY SPINE MY BREAST-BONE VISIBLY GROWS LIKE A HARP A RICH EMBROIDERY BEDEWS MY FACE FROM BRUSH-DROPS THICK AND THIN
YOU0000001975_S0000070 THE OLD COVENANT OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THROUGH MOSES AND THE NEW COVENANT THROUGH CHRIST HAD ALREADY BEEN REPRESENTED AROUND THE WALLS OF THE CHAPEL
YOU0000001975_S0000076 THE SCHEME IS COMPLETED BY FOUR LARGE CORNER PENDENTIVES EACH ILLUSTRATING A DRAMATIC BIBLICAL STORY THE NARRATIVE ELEMENTS OF THE CEILING ILLUSTRATE THAT GOD MADE THE WORLD AS A PERFECT CREATION AND PUT HUMANITY INTO IT THAT HUMANITY FELL INTO DISGRACE AND WAS PUNISHED BY DEATH AND BY SEPARATION FROM GOD
YOU0000001975_S0000081 TRADITIONALLY THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS PERCEIVED AS A PREFIGURING OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
YOU0000001975_S0000088 THESE TWO VIEWS WERE NOT NECESSARILY IRRECONCILABLE TO THE CHURCH BUT ONLY THROUGH A RECOGNITION THAT THE UNIQUE WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS ELEVATION OF SPIRIT MIND AND BODY WAS THROUGH THE CHURCH AS THE AGENT OF GOD
YOU0000001975_S0000093 THE ICONOGRAPHY OF THE CEILING HAS HAD VARIOUS INTERPRETATIONS IN THE PAST SOME ELEMENTS OF WHICH HAVE BEEN CONTRADICTED BY MODERN SCHOLARSHIP
YOU0000001975_S0000104 THE CEILING RISES TO THIRTEEN POINT FOUR METRES ABOVE THE MAIN FLOOR OF THE CHAPEL
YOU0000001975_S0000111 THIS IS THE REAL ARCHITECTURE
YOU0000001975_S0000120 TEN BROAD PAINTED CROSSRIBS OF TRAVERTINE CROSS THE CEILING AND DIVIDE IT INTO ALTERNATELY WIDE AND NARROW PICTORIAL SPACES A GRID THAT GIVES ALL THE FIGURES THEIR DEFINED PLACE A GREAT NUMBER OF SMALL FIGURES ARE INTEGRATED WITH THE PAINTED ARCHITECTURE THEIR PURPOSE APPARENTLY PURELY DECORATIVE
YOU0000001975_S0000132 IF THEY ARE PERCEIVED AS THREE GROUPS THEN THE PICTURES IN EACH OF THE THREE UNITS INFORM UPON EACH OTHER IN THE SAME WAY AS WAS USUAL IN MEDIEVAL PAINTINGS AND STAINED GLASS
YOU0000001975_S0000137 HOWEVER THE THREE SECTIONS ARE GENERALLY DESCRIBED IN THE ORDER OF BIBLICAL CHRONOLOGY
YOU0000001975_S0000145 ON THE FOURTH DAY GOD PUTS THE SUN AND THE MOON IN PLACE TO GOVERN THE NIGHT AND THE DAY THE TIME AND THE SEASONS OF THE YEAR
YOU0000001975_S0000152 IN THIS SEQUENCE OF THREE TWO OF THE PANELS ARE LARGE AND ONE SMALL
YOU0000001975_S0000162 THE ARK IN WHICH NOAH'S FAMILY ESCAPED FLOATS AT THE REAR OF THE PICTURE WHILE THE REST OF HUMANITY TRIES FRANTICALLY TO SCRAMBLE TO SOME POINT OF SAFETY
YOU0000001975_S0000168 HIS YOUNGEST SON HAM BRINGS HIS TWO BROTHERS SHEM AND JAPHETH TO SEE THE SIGHT BUT THEY DISCREETLY COVER THEIR FATHER WITH A CLOAK
YOU0000001975_S0000180 IN THE LATTER GOLD LEAF HAS BEEN APPLIED LAVISHLY TO MANY DETAILS AND IN SOME OF THE FRESCOES NOTABLY THOSE BY PERUGINO HAS BEEN MOST EXPERTLY USED NOT JUST TO DETAIL THE ROBES BUT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FOLDS BY SUBTLE GRADUATION IN THE DENSITY OF GOLDEN FLECKS
YOU0000001975_S0000186 JOAB SNEAKING UP ON ABNER TO MURDER HIM JORAM BEING HURLED FROM A CHARIOT ONTO HIS HEAD
YOU0000001975_S0000193 THE OTHER MALE AND FEMALE FIGURES ALTERNATE DOWN EACH SIDE EACH BEING IDENTIFIED BY AN INSCRIPTION ON A PAINTED MARBLE PANEL SUPPORTED BY A PUTTO
YOU0000001975_S0000202 ZECHARIAH PROPHESIED
YOU0000001975_S0000208 JONAH WAS THUS SEEN AS PRESAGING JESUS WHO HAVING DIED BY CRUCIFIXION SPENT PART OF THREE DAYS IN A TOMB AND WAS RAISED ON THE THIRD DAY
YOU0000001975_S0000217 THE CUMAEAN SIBYL FOR EXAMPLE IS QUOTED BY VIRGIL IN HIS FOURTH ECLOGUE AS DECLARING THAT A NEW PROGENY OF HEAVEN WOULD BRING ABOUT A RETURN OF THE GOLDEN AGE
YOU0000001975_S0000226 THE BRAZEN SERPENT THE PUNISHMENT OF HAMAN DAVID AND GOLIATH JUDITH AND HOLOFERNESTHE FIRST TWO STORIES WERE BOTH SEEN IN MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE THEOLOGY AS PREFIGURING THE CRUCIFIXION OF JESUS
YOU0000001975_S0000232 THE KING WHO IS GOING OVER HIS BOOKS DURING A SLEEPLESS NIGHT REALISES SOMETHING IS AMISS
YOU0000001975_S0000238 ALTHOUGH IN THE HOLOFERNES PICTURE THE FIGURES ARE SMALLER AND THE SPACE LESS FILLED BOTH HAVE THE TRIANGULAR SPACE DIVIDED INTO TWO ZONES BY A VERTICAL WALL ALLOWING US TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING ON BOTH SIDES OF IT
YOU0000001975_S0000248 MICHELANGELO WAS COMMISSIONED TO PAINT THESE AREAS AS PART OF THE WORK ON THE CEILING
YOU0000001975_S0000256 THESE FIGURES VAGUELY SUGGEST VARIOUS FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS MOST LUNETTES CONTAIN ONE OR MORE INFANTS AND MANY DEPICT A MAN AND A WOMAN OFTEN SITTING ON OPPOSING SIDES OF THE PAINTED PLAQUE THAT SEPARATES THEM
YOU0000001975_S0000261 OF THE TWO REMAINING ONE SHOWS A WOMAN WITH SHEARS TRIMMING THE NECK OF A GARMENT SHE IS MAKING WHILE HER TODDLER LOOKS ON
YOU0000001975_S0000268 THE FIGURES IN THEM ARE PHYSICALLY DIVIDED BY THE NAME TABLET BUT THEY ARE ALSO DIVIDED BY A RANGE OF HUMAN EMOTIONS THAT TURN THEM OUTWARD OR IN ON THEMSELVES AND SOMETIMES TOWARDS THEIR PARTNER WITH JEALOUSY SUSPICION RAGE OR SIMPLY BOREDOM
YOU0000001975_S0000273 THE FEMALE TO THE LEFT HAS HAD AS MUCH CARE TAKEN WITH HER CLOTHING AS ANY OF THE SIBYLS HER SKIRT IS TURNED BACK SHOWING HER LINEN PETTICOAT AND THE GARTER THAT HOLDS UP HER MAUVE STOCKINGS AND CUTS INTO THE FLESH
YOU0000001975_S0000278 ADDED TO THIS THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM OF POOR DAYTIME VISIBILITY OF THE PANELS NEAREST THE WINDOWS BECAUSE OF HALINATION
YOU0000001975_S0000285 WHILE THE PAIRS OF THE MONOCHROME MALE AND FEMALE FIGURES ABOVE THE SPANDRELS ARE MIRRORS OF EACH OTHER THESE IGNUDI ARE ALL DIFFERENT
YOU0000001975_S0000290 BUT MICHELANGELO KNEW THE BIBLE WELL
YOU0000001975_S0000295 IT IS REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE IGNUDI REPRESENT ANGELS
YOU0000001975_S0000309 UNPRECEDENTED INVENTION
YOU0000001975_S0000318 WITHIN MICHELANGELO'S OWN WORK THE CHAPEL CEILING LED TO THE LATER AND MORE MANNERIST PAINTING OF THE LAST JUDGEMENT IN WHICH THE CROWDED COMPOSITIONS GAVE FULL REIN TO HIS INVENTIVENESS IN PAINTING CONTORTED AND FORESHORTENED FIGURES EXPRESSING DESPAIR OR JUBILATION
YOU0000001975_S0000330 HOWEVER THE RESTORATION WAS MET WITH BOTH PRAISE AND CRITICISM
YOU0000001975_S0000339 I WAS SO CLOSE TO HIM I COULD SEE THE BRISTLES FROM HIS BRUSHES CAUGHT IN THE PAINT AND THE MUCKY THUMBPRINTS HE'D LEFT ALONG HIS MARGINS
YOU0000001975_S0000344 IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THE ANGELS WHO ATTEND THE SCARY PROPHETESS ON THE SISTINE CEILING KNOWN AS THE CUMAEAN SIBYL YOU WILL SEE THAT ONE OF THEM HAS STUCK HIS THUMB BETWEEN HIS FINGERS IN THAT MYSTERIOUSLY OBSCENE GESTURE THAT VISITING FANS ARE STILL TREATED TO TODAY AT ITALIAN FOOTBALL MATCHES
YOU0000001983_S0000005 DR GARY KREMER WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY
YOU0000001983_S0000019 HE WROTE LLOYD GAINES AND THE FIGHT TO END SEGREGATION
YOU0000001983_S0000026 THE BOOK ACCORDING TO ONE REVIEWER
YOU0000001983_S0000046 UPHELD RACIAL SEGREGATION IN STATES THROUGH WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL DOCTRINE
YOU0000001983_S0000057 ALTHOUGH RAISED IN MINNESOTA WILKINS WAS BORN IN ST LOUIS AND WORKED AT THE CALL
YOU0000001983_S0000065 IT WAS NOT A PRIORITY FOR MARGOLD
YOU0000001983_S0000074 HOUSTON'S IDEAS WERE SIMILAR TO MARGOLD'S BUT HOUSTON WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN PURSUING DESEGREGATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION
YOU0000001983_S0000079 AND I THINK IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT HOUSTON WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN LAW PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION
YOU0000001983_S0000087 NOTHING WAS AVAILABLE IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI
YOU0000001983_S0000095 STATE LEGISLATION SPONSORED BY REPRESENTATIVE WALTHALL MOORE THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEGISLATOR
YOU0000001983_S0000103 LITIGATION WOULD BE LESS COMPLICATED THAN IN COMPARING THE RELATIVE QUALITY OF BLACK AND WHITE INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE STATE
YOU0000001983_S0000119 MISSOURI WAS A BORDER STATE
YOU0000001983_S0000124 REDMOND WAS A BLACK LAWYER WHO LIKE HOUSTON
YOU0000001983_S0000134 NONE OF THEM WERE ORIGINALLY FROM MISSOURI
YOU0000001983_S0000145 SO THEY'RE SEEKING A CLIENT
YOU0000001983_S0000157 HOWEVER WHEN THE UNIVERSITY RECEIVED HIS TRANSCRIPT FROM LINCOLN UNIVERSITY A SCHOOL FOR BLACKS ONLY
YOU0000001983_S0000164 THEY WOULDN'T BE DENIED ON THE BASIS OF RACE
YOU0000001983_S0000172 SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT CANADA WOULD FORWARD THE CORRESPONDENCE ON TO FREDERICK MIDDLEBUSH WHO WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY
YOU0000001983_S0000178 AND AS MANDATED BY LAW LINCOLN UNIVERSITY INFORMED LLOYD GAINES OF THE SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO HIM TO STUDY LAW OUT OF STATE
YOU0000001983_S0000190 HE PASSES AWAY DURING THE TIME AND FREDERICK MIDDLEBUSH
YOU0000001983_S0000201 SO IN APRIL
YOU0000001983_S0000206 BUT IN DRAFTING THE PETITION DO SO WITHOUT REFERENCE TO COLOR AND MAKE THEM PLEAD COLOR IN THE ANSWER
YOU0000001983_S0000213 AND I SHOULD EMPHASIZE AT THIS TIME THAT LITIGATING THIS CASE WAS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR GAINES AND HIS COUNSEL
YOU0000001983_S0000232 WELL AT THE CIRCUIT COURT TRIAL PROMINENT KANSAS CITY ATTORNEY WILLIAM SLOAN HOGSETT
YOU0000001983_S0000239 IN SPITE OF ALL OF THESE POSITIONS JUDGE DINWIDDIE RULED AGAINST GAINES WITH NO OPINION AND THE CASE WAS APPEALED TO THE MISSOURI SUPREME COURT THE STATE SUPREME COURT
YOU0000001983_S0000248 SO THEY LOSE AT THE MISSOURI SUPREME COURT BUT LOSS AT THE MISSOURI SUPREME COURT WAS NOT DISAPPOINTING TO CHARLES HOUSTON
YOU0000001983_S0000258 THEY WERE BUST
YOU0000001983_S0000265 AND THEY WOULD ULTIMATELY NOT SUCCEED AT THAT BY THE WAY
YOU0000001983_S0000272 AND IN FACT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT RULED VERY QUICKLY
YOU0000001983_S0000281 A PRIVILEGE HAS BEEN CREATED FOR WHITE LAW STUDENTS
YOU0000001983_S0000287 SO THE COURT IN ITS DECISION
YOU0000001983_S0000298 THE SUPREME COURT DECISION WAS THREE AND A HALF YEARS AFTER GAINES FIRST APPLIES FOR ADMISSION TO MISSOURI LAW SCHOOL
YOU0000001983_S0000308 HE BOARDED A TRAIN FOR CHICAGO AT UNION STATION WITH THE HOPE OF FINDING EMPLOYMENT IN CHICAGO
YOU0000001983_S0000318 SO LLOYD GAINES WRITES TO HIS MOTHER
YOU0000001983_S0000323 AND SAY HOW GREAT AND NOBLE IS THE IDEA
YOU0000001983_S0000328 NOT ONE WHO HAS FOUGHT AND SACRIFICED TO MAKE THE CASE POSSIBLE
YOU0000001983_S0000333 SHOULD I FORGET TO WRITE FOR A TIME DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
YOU0000001983_S0000341 THUS A NEW BLACK ONLY LAW SCHOOL COULD BE ORGANIZED AS AN EXTENSION OF LINCOLN UNIVERSITY IMMEDIATELY
YOU0000001983_S0000352 THE DEAN OF THE LINCOLN LAW SCHOOL MUCH TO CHARLES HOUSTON'S DISGUST WAS WILLIAM TAYLOR
YOU0000001983_S0000358 THE NEW LINCOLN FACULTY WERE
YOU0000001983_S0000370 WHICH APPLIES EQUAL PROTECTION TO THE STATES
YOU0000001983_S0000379 AND SO THEY ORGANIZED PICKETING OF LINCOLN LAW AND THAT CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS
YOU0000001983_S0000389 AFTER THE HEARING WHERE THE DEPOSITIONS WERE TAKEN
YOU0000001983_S0000396 GAINES WAS ROOMING TEMPORARILY AT A FRATERNITY HOUSE IN CHICAGO
YOU0000001983_S0000403 REDMOND AND THE OTHER ATTORNEYS MADE EVERY EFFORT TO LOCATE GAINES BY CONTACTING THOSE WHO KNEW HIM
YOU0000001983_S0000411 AND TRAINING GROUND FOR ROY WILKINS
YOU0000001983_S0000418 BLUFORD CONTINUED TO APPLY AND FILE LAWSUITS WITH HOUSTON REDMOND AND OTHER ATTORNEYS IN THE KANSAS CITY AREA
YOU0000001983_S0000439 PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THE CASE STARTED WHEN MIDDLEBUSH WAS A NEW PRESIDENT
YOU0000001983_S0000448 OR WAS IT LIKE
YOU0000001983_S0000464 I'M A LITTLE UNCLEAR ON WHY THEY FINALLY RELENTED
YOU0000001983_S0000490 I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANKS FOR PRACTICAL BREAK DOWN OF A SITUATION THAT I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW VAGUE MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT WAS UNTIL IT'S HISTORICALLY LAID OUT
YOU0000001983_S0000501 HE COULD PRACTICE LAW WITHIN THE STATE OF MISSOURI
YOU0000001983_S0000513 AND IN FACT THERE IS SOME CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT LLOYD GAINES MAY HAVE GONE TO MEXICO CITY
YOU0000001983_S0000523 DO YOU THINK BECAUSE HE WASN'T LIKE
YOU0000001983_S0000542 SO THE FBI NEVER OPENED A CASE ON WHAT HAPPENED TO LLOYD GAINES
YOU0000001991_S0000007 USING ONLY TODAY'S BEST INTERNET SALES FUNNELS
YOU0000001991_S0000017 MY BUSINESS

YOU0000001999_S0000089 HOPPING ON THE TRAIN GOING INTO A COFFEE SHOP
YOU0000001999_S0000094 WHEREAS I THINK EARLY ON I WAS DISCOURAGED BECAUSE I WOULD WRITE A JOKE AND BE THAT'S STUPID IT'S NOT ORIGINAL IT'S WHATEVER
YOU0000001999_S0000100 AND THIS SINGLE PANEL DRAWING COULD ACTUALLY BE A CHARACTER FOR AN ANIMATED FILM IDEA
YOU0000001999_S0000107 SITTING IN ONE PLACE IN JUST A WHITE ROOM WOULD PROBABLY NOT HELP ME SO MUCH
YOU0000001999_S0000122 AND THEN ON THE SECOND OUT OF THREE YEARS
YOU0000001999_S0000131 AND THEN SHORTLY AFTER GETTING INTO LAW SCHOOL I JUST REALIZED THAT I DON'T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE

YOU0000002015_S0000171 YOU KNOW WHERE

YOU0000002023_S0000183 THAT ACADEMIC JOURNEY WAS A LAUNCHING PAD FOR WHAT IS ALREADY A REMARKABLE
YOU0000002023_S0000189 PAUL'S FEARLESS JOURNEY SHOWS JUST WHAT SYRACUSE STUDENTS ARE CAPABLE OF
YOU0000002023_S0000197 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN FEEL IT BUT THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS MOMENT

YOU0000002023_S0000226 IF I COULD GET YOU TO DO ONE THING AS YOU START THIS JOURNEY HERE'S WHAT IT WOULD BE
YOU0000002023_S0000231 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT EVERY DAY WE WAKE UP
YOU0000002023_S0000237 IT'S GOING THROUGH THIS CONTINUOUS RENEWAL PROCESS IF YOU WILL
YOU0000002023_S0000242 YOU'VE GOTTEN IN
YOU0000002023_S0000248 AS YOU BEGIN THIS PROCESS

YOU0000002023_S0000260 I REMEMBER CALLING ONE RELATIVE WHO I KNEW WORKED IN THE BUILDING
YOU0000002023_S0000265 ALL THE SUDDEN FOLLOWING THAT DAY WE BEGAN TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW DO WE SECURE THE FREEDOMS THAT WE HAVE
YOU0000002023_S0000273 AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT FEELING OF FRUSTRATION THAT I FELT
YOU0000002023_S0000278 THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI COULD JUST AS EASILY HAPPEN TO US
YOU0000002023_S0000286 WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO WHEN PEOPLE
YOU0000002023_S0000293 HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE INNOVATION AND AT THE SAME TIME
YOU0000002023_S0000301 BUT TEN YEARS IS STILL TEN YEARS AND SO MUCH HAS TRANSPIRED SINCE THEN
YOU0000002023_S0000312 AS I REFLECT ON THE PAST TEN YEARS
YOU0000002023_S0000321 THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE FOUND OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE OF LAW
YOU0000002023_S0000327 IN FACT AS I'M SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW SOME OF YOU PROBABLY HAVE YOUR EYES SET ON ONE OR MORE INDIVIDUALS IN THIS ROOM
YOU0000002023_S0000419 STRENGTHENS AND SUPPORTS THE REST

YOU0000002031_S0000036 WAS JUST AS INTERESTING AS WHAT I WAS GOING TO GET
YOU0000002031_S0000050 AND THEN LATER PEOPLE WERE ADDING SAINT GERMAIN AND CREME DE VIOLETTE AND FLORAL INGREDIENTS

YOU0000002031_S0000082 ORDER A BEER AND A MAKER'S ON THE ROCKS
YOU0000002031_S0000090 REFRESHING
YOU0000002031_S0000100 MAN
YOU0000002031_S0000114 BUT AT THAT TIME THE COCKTAIL BARS IN NEW YORK WERE REALLY MILK AND HONEY
YOU0000002031_S0000133 THIS IS THE FIRST BARTENDER'S GUIDE
YOU0000002031_S0000145 THIS WAS BEFORE SPIRITS WERE DISTRIBUTED IN BOTTLES SO IT HAD INFORMATION FOR HOW TO TAP KEGS OF BEER AND HOW TO BLEND WHISKEYS TOGETHER
YOU0000002031_S0000154 THESE ARE OTHER BARTENDERS FROM OTHER PLACES I BELIEVE O H BYRON IS NEW YORK AND THE MIXICOLOGIST WAS PUBLISHED IN CINCINNATI
YOU0000002031_S0000164 ONE OF THE REASONS WHY AM I SHOWING YOU THESE SLIDES
YOU0000002031_S0000178 THE PUBLISHER WOULD LOOK AT ME AND BE LIKE AH
YOU0000002031_S0000198 WE SEE THESE BARTENDERS WHO'VE GONE FROM JUST BEING GUYS WHO RAN PUBS TO BEING FAMOUS
YOU0000002031_S0000222 BUT THIS BOOK BY ENSSLIN WHO WAS ALSO A NEW YORK BARTENDER
YOU0000002031_S0000247 THEY WENT TO TIJUANA THEY WENT TO PARIS THEY WENT TO LONDON
YOU0000002031_S0000258 AND THIS IS A PERIOD
YOU0000002031_S0000277 I THINK CROSBY GAIGE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GAY
YOU0000002031_S0000293 AND THEN WE MOVE FORWARD TO I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO END GUYS HOLD ON
YOU0000002031_S0000303 AND I INCLUDED A BOOK THAT CAME OUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE
YOU0000002031_S0000319 THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS ACTUALLY AN OPTION
YOU0000002031_S0000339 AND HIS BOOK AMERICAN BAR WRITTEN BY A GERMAN WAS A HUGE INFLUENCE ON MY BOOK
YOU0000002031_S0000349 YOU'LL SEE A BIT OF THAT SORT OF PATRICK GAVIN DUFFY
YOU0000002031_S0000364 THIS IS SO BORING WHO WOULD WANT TO DRINK IN A HOTEL BAR
YOU0000002031_S0000382 THIS IS A GREAT BOOK BUT IT WASN'T WHAT I WANTED TO WRITE
YOU0000002031_S0000396 I WANTED A BOOK THAT HAD THE FOOD RECIPES IN THE BACK
YOU0000002031_S0000402 WHEN YOU HAVE A DRINK SITTING ON THAT
YOU0000002031_S0000408 YOU ALWAYS WANT TO USE A NICE FRESH ORANGE WITH A SHINY SKIN
YOU0000002031_S0000424 AND I GUESS WHAT I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH BEFORE I TAKE A COUPLE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE RUNNING LATE
YOU0000002031_S0000437 INSTEAD OF JUST GETTING TO THAT INFORMATION
YOU0000002039_S0000011 AND DEREK IS NOW IN THE MIDST OF A NATIONWIDE BOOK TOUR
YOU0000002039_S0000025 SO THE SEVEN-WORD THESIS OF THE BOOK TO KICK US OFF
YOU0000002039_S0000033 THEY HATE NEW THINGS THEY PARTICULARLY HATE THINGS THAT ARE EXTREMELY NEW
YOU0000002039_S0000051 ONLINE HOWEVER INFORMATION LEAVES A DATA TRAIL AS PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE ARE PROBABLY EXTREMELY AWARE
YOU0000002039_S0000062 AND DRUDGE PICKS IT UP
YOU0000002039_S0000072 AND I THINK IT'S RELEVANT FOR BOTH PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS OF INFORMATION
YOU0000002039_S0000078 OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE SHARED THAN OTHER THINGS
YOU0000002039_S0000086 THEREFORE IT MUST BE TRUE EVEN THOUGH I DISTRUST ALL OF THESE RIGHT WING AND MAYBE EVEN LEFT WING SOURCES OF NEWS
YOU0000002039_S0000101 THEY WOULD SURVEY RADIO DEEJAYS
YOU0000002039_S0000106 BECAUSE WHEN MUSIC WAS A SCARCE RESOURCE WHEN IT WASN'T DIGITIZED AND IT WAS JUST VINYL RECORDS THAT YOU HAD TO STORE IF YOU HAD SOLD OUT OF ACDC
YOU0000002039_S0000116 AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ALMOST OVERNIGHT LITERALLY WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH
YOU0000002039_S0000123 SECOND
YOU0000002039_S0000131 THE PARTY DECIDES THEORY WILL SOUND VERY FAMILIAR TO YOU SINCE I JUST TOLD YOU THE BILLBOARD STORY
YOU0000002039_S0000142 AND I BEGAN MY INVESTIGATION OF MUSIC AT THE VERY MOST ELEMENTAL QUESTION OF
YOU0000002039_S0000150 AND YOU START REPEATING IT AGAIN
YOU0000002039_S0000156 IT IS THE THING THAT DISTINGUISHES THE CACOPHONY OF THE ORDINARY WORLD FROM THAT WHICH THE BRAIN PROCESSES AS SONG
YOU0000002039_S0000162 START REPEATING IT AGAIN
YOU0000002039_S0000169 THE MOUSE WILL HABITUATE
YOU0000002039_S0000175 SO NOW YOU CAN GO BACK TO PLAYING THE B NOTE TO SCARE THE MOUSE
YOU0000002039_S0000182 AND IF YOU TAKE A SLIVER OF THAT RONDO SEQUENCE
YOU0000002039_S0000189 BRIDGE
YOU0000002039_S0000200 THERE'S TRICOLON WHICH IS REPETITION IN SHORT TRIPLICATE
YOU0000002039_S0000205 THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED ANTIMETABOLE
YOU0000002039_S0000210 IT'S NOT THE SIZE OF THE DOG IN THE FIGHT IT'S THE SIZE OF THE FIGHT IN THE DOG HILLARY CLINTON HUMAN RIGHTS ARE WOMEN'S RIGHTS
YOU0000002039_S0000219 RHYME TO REASON EFFECT SAYS THAT WE ARE WEIRDLY MORE LIKELY TO BELIEVE IDEAS AND SLOGANS IF THEY CONTAIN AN ELEMENT OF RHYME
YOU0000002039_S0000226 BUT IF YOU TAKE THE FIRST HALF OF THAT
YOU0000002039_S0000232 BUT WE REPEAT THE IDEA OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE WE DON'T HEAR THE POLICY WE HEAR THE MUSIC
YOU0000002039_S0000239 AND TYPICALLY THERE ARE SORT OF THREE CATEGORIES OF EXPLANATION FOR WHAT MIGHT DRIVE THESE TRENDS THE FIRST COULD BE PRICES
YOU0000002039_S0000249 ETHEL IS AN UNPOPULAR NAME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
YOU0000002039_S0000254 AND THERE IS NO MARKETING
YOU0000002039_S0000260 WHY ARE THERE HYPE CYCLES IN FIRST NAMES IF FIRST NAMES ARE UNLIKE ANY OTHER MARKETPLACE IN WHICH CULTURE APPLIES
YOU0000002039_S0000270 SO FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF HUMAN HISTORY YOU HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE THE TURNOVER RATE OF FIRST NAMES SORT OF RESEMBLES A FLAT PLANE
YOU0000002039_S0000276 ALL OVER THE WESTERN WORLD
YOU0000002039_S0000285 AND SO FIRST SO ECONOMICS THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION TURNS FIRST NAMES INTO IDENTITY MARKERS
YOU0000002039_S0000296 AND POPULARITY AS A TASTE SAYS THAT IN ADDITION TO ALL THE QUALITIES THAT WE KNOW EXIST IN A CULTURAL PRODUCT SAY IN A SONG WHO SINGS IT WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE HOW LOUD IT IS WHAT THE CHORD STRUCTURE IS THERE IS A SIGNAL THAT HOVERS ABOVE THOSE QUALITIES
YOU0000002039_S0000301 AND SOME PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT SIGNAL AND THEY INTERPRET IT IN THE ENTIRELY OPPOSITE WAY
YOU0000002039_S0000307 I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S POPULAR
YOU0000002039_S0000312 THEY LIKE WHAT I CALL IN THE BOOK
YOU0000002039_S0000317 SO IF MOST PARENTS LIKE NAMES THAT HAVE SORT OF A LITTLE BIT OF NEWNESS BUT AREN'T THAT FAMILIAR
YOU0000002039_S0000326 INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES COLLECTIVELY MAKING INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS DRIVE A HYPE CYCLE FOR BABY GIRL NAMES
YOU0000002039_S0000332 IT'S VERY STRANGE IF THE FOURTH CHILD'S NAME IS ZANTHOPY
YOU0000002039_S0000338 WELL MY NAME IS THOR AND MY SISTER'S NAME IS SARAH AND IT'S LIKE
YOU0000002039_S0000355 RAYMOND LOEWY IS THE FATHER OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN
YOU0000002039_S0000361 COMING TOGETHER HAVING A BABY
YOU0000002039_S0000372 SO EVERY TIME IN A MOVIE
YOU0000002039_S0000379 NEOPHILIA
YOU0000002039_S0000391 AND SO IN TECHNOLOGY THE CHALLENGE IS OFTEN HOW TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT IS SURPRISING FAMILIAR
YOU0000002039_S0000400 IT SOUNDS LIKE AN ORDINARY ASSISTANT
YOU0000002039_S0000407 AND I THINK THAT THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN
YOU0000002039_S0000412 THEY WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING THAT'S COUNTERINTUITIVE
YOU0000002039_S0000421 EVERY YEAR THIS CENTURY A MAJORITY OF THE TOP TEN FILMS IN THE US HAVE BEEN SEQUELS ADAPTATIONS AND REBOOTS
YOU0000002039_S0000427 LAST DISCOVERY OF THIS WHIP-SMART NEW TECHNOLOGY FAMILIARITY BREEDS LIKING
YOU0000002039_S0000457 YOU INTRODUCE AN IPOD AND THE SCREEN GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND YOU LEAD PEOPLE INTO THE NEW PRODUCT
YOU0000002039_S0000472 AND B CAN TELL YOU THAT THE MAINSTREAM IS WRONG
YOU0000002039_S0000482 AS A COLLECTIVE NOUN
YOU0000002039_S0000495 LIKE I LOVE SELENA GOMEZ MAYBE BUT MY GRANDMOTHER MAY HATE SELENA GOMEZ SHE DOESN'T LIKE COUNTRY SHE DOESN'T LIKE ROCK SHE DOESN'T LIKE POP
YOU0000002039_S0000519 WHICH IS WHY DO SO MANY CHILDREN OF CONSERVATIVES GROW UP BECOMING LIBERALS
YOU0000002047_S0000022 YOU CO-WROTE THIS FILM AND AND MEL BROOKS DIRECTED THE MOVIE
YOU0000002047_S0000030 ARE YOU CRAZY
YOU0000002047_S0000035 AND IF YOU DIDN'T ARGUE FOR IT I KNEW IT WOULD BE WRONG
YOU0000002047_S0000053 ANYWAY
YOU0000002055_S0000013 AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT HAPPENS I THINK IT'S SORT OF LUDICROUS THAT I'M HERE
YOU0000002055_S0000033 AND THEN I OPT TO DO IT ANYWAY
YOU0000002055_S0000069 ANN ARBOR
YOU0000002055_S0000085 TRAMPOLINES
YOU0000002055_S0000104 AND THIS KID WHO WENT TO PRINCETON WHO I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU0000002055_S0000114 THAT ALSO DIDN'T GO WELL
YOU0000002055_S0000138 WHEN KATE WHO ORGANIZED THIS SAID YOU HAVE TO SIGN THESE THINGS FOR OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL WHICH WE OWN I WAS AMAZED TO REALIZE YOU DON'T OWN YOUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL THAT YOU POST THESE ON
YOU0000002055_S0000149 AND HE EXPLAINED TO ME WHY WAS SUCH A BAD IDEA FOR ME TO NOT CONTINUE THIS WEB SERIES AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON A BOOK
YOU0000002055_S0000164 SO I WENT ON TWITTER
YOU0000002055_S0000174 AND THEN FOR SOME REASON
YOU0000002055_S0000186 THANK YOU I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD DO AND HE PAUSED AND SAID
YOU0000002055_S0000194 NOT THE SMARTEST IDEA
YOU0000002055_S0000203 BUT I ALSO WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT I'VE HAD PEOPLE TELL ME CERTAIN THINGS ARE GOOD IDEAS
YOU0000002055_S0000215 VERSUS WALT DISNEY
YOU0000002055_S0000222 IT DIDN'T TURN OUT WELL TO SAY THE LEAST IT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE AND IT WAS KIND OF A PUBLIC FLOP
YOU0000002055_S0000229 I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT BECAUSE I'VE LITERALLY NEVER MET YOU IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
YOU0000002055_S0000237 THAT WAS REALLY LOUD AND ALSO PHYSICALLY PAINFUL
YOU0000002055_S0000247 AND THAT LEAD US TO THE CHRIS GETHARD SHOW
YOU0000002055_S0000256 WITHIN ONE YEAR'S TIME THAT'S A REALLY BAD SIGN OF YOUR CAREER TRAJECTORY RIGHT
YOU0000002055_S0000261 JUST LAST WEEK WE HAD EIGHT DIFFERENT PEOPLE MAKE CARDBOARD ROBOT SUITS AND FIST FIGHT EACH OTHER ON THE AIR

YOU0000002567_S0000315 THE FENCE ITSELF ALSO HAS A STOP HERE AND IT'S SORT OF A CAM ACTION LOCK IN THE STOP SO THERE'S NO CLAMP
YOU0000002567_S0000321 ALL THE THINGS YOU NEED TO SEE THE DETAIL
YOU0000002567_S0000339 THE ORIENTATION IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY CRANK THIS THING UP AND DOWN WITH EASE
YOU0000002567_S0000349 IF THEY GET SEA SICKNESS
YOU0000002567_S0000356 WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE CURVES
YOU0000002567_S0000364 THERE'S A RELIEF THERE SO IT DOESN'T PINCH FINGERS
YOU0000002567_S0000374 SO WE GOT A NICE THREE QUARTER INCH LIP TO HOLD STUFF IN BUT WHAT I'M THINKING IS WE'RE EITHER GONNA PUT HIS LITTLE
YOU0000002567_S0000380 SO BOTH SIDES HAVE THIS LITTLE RELIEF
YOU0000002567_S0000389 AND THIS WAY IF THE KID WANTS TO DRAW ON IT AND DECORATE IT AND DO SOMETHING FUN WITH IT
YOU0000002567_S0000426 YOU'RE SO WEIRD NICOLE
YOU0000002567_S0000434 THE THING IS THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN USE DIAMOND PLATES FOR ALL OF THEIR SHARPENING NEEDS
YOU0000002567_S0000443 SO I'LL USE THAT FOR MY LOWEST
YOU0000002567_S0000458 AND THEY'RE ALL RIGHT
YOU0000002567_S0000464 HOW WOULD YOU GET NICE NINETY DEGREE ANGLES WITH A PLANER
YOU0000002567_S0000471 USUALLY THE WAY YOU GET A NICE NINETY DEGREE ANGLE IS TO ESTABLISH THAT ANGLE AT THE JOINTER FIRST
YOU0000002567_S0000480 IS HIS LAST NAME MAKES AND HIS MIDDLE NAME CHRIS
YOU0000002567_S0000485 I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE FLOOR TILES AT WOODWORKER'S SOURCE
YOU0000002567_S0000498 NOPE

YOU0000002567_S0000515 COMPARE THAT TO HOW MANY BLADES YOU MIGHT GO THROUGH IN THE DISPOSABLE WORLD
YOU0000002567_S0000527 AND THIS IS KINDA
YOU0000002567_S0000539 AND WE CAN PROBABLY DO A STOP HERE
YOU0000002567_S0000550 BUT A ROUTER NEEDS TO BE GUIDED
YOU0000002567_S0000565 SO I'M GONNA SHOW YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE
YOU0000002567_S0000575 RIGHT THIS IS THE KEY THING OF COURSE THERE'S A STRAIGHT BIT IN THERE
YOU0000002567_S0000583 THAT GOES AROUND AND MOST ROUTER BASES
YOU0000002567_S0000590 SO IF YOU'RE DESIGNING A JIG
YOU0000002567_S0000597 SO THE IDEA IS YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT A VERY SET DISTANCE BETWEEN THE OUTSIDE OF THE GUIDE BUSHING AND WHERE THE BIT STARTS TO CUT
YOU0000002567_S0000610 SO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO DO THAT MATH TO FIGURE THIS TYPE OF THING OUT
YOU0000002567_S0000622 AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT I'VE GOT HERE
YOU0000002567_S0000629 YOU'RE GONNA PUT THESE PIECES ON THE INSIDE SO WHEN THE JIG IS FINALLY TOGETHER YOU HAVE TO JUST ACCOUNT FOR WHERE YOUR CLAMPS ARE GONNA BE AND HOW BIG YOUR ROUTER BASE IS
YOU0000002567_S0000637 HOPEFULLY IT'LL BE QUICK I'LL USE SOME CA GLUE
YOU0000002567_S0000642 I CUT THIS EXTRA PIECE OFF
YOU0000002567_S0000647 HOPEFULLY THIS
YOU0000002567_S0000655 THIS OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT GET GLUED IN IT'S JUST A SPACER
YOU0000002567_S0000664 BEAR WITH ME
YOU0000002567_S0000672 YOU COULD CUT ANOTHER STRIP
YOU0000002567_S0000678 IT WOULD LINE UP EXACTLY WHERE WE WANT IT TO BE
YOU0000002567_S0000686 AND AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A FENCE IN PLACE IF YOU INSTALL A FENCE
YOU0000002567_S0000710 GET SOME EYE PROTECTION
YOU0000002567_S0000718 LET'S CLEAN UP
YOU0000002567_S0000741 ALL RIGHT
YOU0000002567_S0000750 AND ALL YOU'RE DOING WITH THESE IS THESE MIDDLE SECTIONS IT'S DUAL PURPOSE
YOU0000002567_S0000759 BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO THAT
YOU0000002567_S0000766 THE BEARING RIDES ALONG THE EDGE AND THEN THE CUTTER DOES THE CUTTING
YOU0000002567_S0000772 UNFORTUNATELY
YOU0000002567_S0000783 I CAN ANSWER A COUPLE QUESTIONS IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS TECHNIQUE
YOU0000002567_S0000793 WOULDN'T THE BIT FOLLOW THE ALREADY ROUTED PORTION OF THE MORTISE
YOU0000002567_S0000802 HOW DO YOU GET RID OF THE ROUNDED CORNERS ON THE MORTISE CUT
YOU0000002567_S0000808 WHAT'LL USUALLY HAPPEN IS YOU'LL PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT SO YOUR CORNERS WILL DIP BACK AND THAT'S NO GOOD
YOU0000002577_S0000048 AND I KNOW THAT YOU GET HEAVY INTO LIKE PREPARING FOR A ROLE

YOU0000002873_S0000007 KEEP IN MIND THAT CHOOSING CREDIBLE SOURCES IS VITAL FOR ANY TYPE OF RESEARCH YOU DO AND IT INFLUENCES THE WAY YOU WILL CONTINUE TO LEARN AND GROW
YOU0000002873_S0000016 INSTEAD IT CAN BE THE STARTING POINT OF YOUR RESEARCH WHERE YOU CAN FIND LINKS IN THE REFERENCE SECTION THAT WILL TAKE YOU TO WHERE WIKIPEDIA SOURCED THEIR INFORMATION AND YOU CAN VISIT THOSE SOURCES AND GET THE INFORMATION YOURSELF
YOU0000002873_S0000022 ALTHOUGH THESE CONTRIBUTORS MIGHT BE INTELLIGENT AND PROVIDE FACTUAL INFORMATION THE SITE LACKS DIVERSIFIED POINTS OF VIEW SO FOR NOW MAYBE NOT ENDING YOUR SEARCH ON WIKIPEDIA IS THE WAY TO GO
YOU0000002873_S0000027 DOES THE INFORMATION SEEM BIASED SEXIST
YOU0000002873_S0000036 AUTHORITY
YOU0000002873_S0000042 SOME QUESTIONS TO ASK ACCORDING TO THE MIRIAM LIBRARY AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHICO ARE WHEN WAS THE INFORMATION PUBLISHED OR POSTED
YOU0000002873_S0000047 DOES THE INFORMATION RELATE TO YOUR TOPIC OR ANSWER YOUR QUESTION
YOU0000002873_S0000056 WHAT ARE THE AUTHOR'S QUALIFICATIONS TO WRITE ON THE TOPIC
YOU0000002873_S0000062 HAS THE INFORMATION BEEN REVIEWED OR REFEREED
YOU0000002873_S0000070 ARE THERE POLITICAL IDEOLOGICAL CULTURAL RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONAL OR PERSONAL BIASES
YOU0000002873_S0000075 IS THE TEXT READABLE DOES COLOR OR A BACKGROUND INHIBIT USE
YOU0000002873_S0000080 SO IF THE INFORMATION IS CRAAP APPROVED YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK
YOU0000002891_S0000007 WE WANT IT TO BE EDUCATIONAL
YOU0000002891_S0000012 I CAME FROM MACEDONIA AS I SAID AND THE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE DOING WHAT THEY CALL SYNCHRONIZING THE HISTORIES
YOU0000002891_S0000021 BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY THING I SPEAK AND WRITE IN
YOU0000002891_S0000029 WHICH CAN NOT ONLY STUDY HISTORY
YOU0000002891_S0000037 SO I'VE LEARNED A BIT ABOUT IT AND I'VE BEEN RATHER FASCINATED ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'M ALSO FASCINATED BY THE FACT THAT I BELIEVE THAT RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE IS AN OVERWHELMINGLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF HISTORY WHICH TODAY WANTS TO BE SORT OF SUBMERGED OR BRUSHED ASIDE
YOU0000002891_S0000043 DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING
YOU0000002891_S0000049 I'M NOT USED TO WORKING WITH A CORD ON A MICROPHONE
YOU0000002891_S0000056 WE SEE THAT BEFORE THIS IS ABOUT THE MAP OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE
YOU0000002891_S0000066 HOW DID THIS HAPPEN
YOU0000002891_S0000075 THIS IS A MASSIVE EXPANSION
YOU0000002891_S0000082 THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT OBJECTIVE THOUGHT
YOU0000002891_S0000089 WHICH DOES NOT HAVE A STORY
YOU0000002891_S0000098 THAT TELLS US THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF TRADE
YOU0000002891_S0000104 BECAUSE IN THE BACK OF THIS BOOK IN THE APPENDIX
YOU0000002891_S0000111 KNOW ABOUT
YOU0000002891_S0000117 WELL NOW WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
YOU0000002891_S0000127 SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS THESE ARE THE NEW AND CURRENT BATTLES AND THEN THEY ARE GOING TO CHANGE TO RED
YOU0000002891_S0000134 AND NOTICE SOMETHING ISLAM IS PROJECTING POWER ACROSS THE OCEANS
YOU0000002891_S0000143 THINK ABOUT THAT
YOU0000002891_S0000148 BECAUSE ALL OF THIS WAS AN IMITATION OF MOHAMMAD
YOU0000002891_S0000158 I'LL PUT IT ON MY MAP
YOU0000002891_S0000165 THIS IS THE NUMBER OF BATTLES BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO NOW IS
YOU0000002891_S0000173 THEY SAID NO WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
YOU0000002891_S0000183 NOTICE SOMETHING HERE I START HERE BY SAYING THAT THIS IS THE FIRST CENTURY OF THE GOLDEN AGE
YOU0000002891_S0000188 ISLAM MOVES TO THE EAST
YOU0000002891_S0000198 THE JIZYA WAS THE TAX ON THE DHIMMI
YOU0000002891_S0000205 SIX THOUSAND JEWS IN MOROCCO BY THE WAY WE'RE STILL IN THE GOLDEN AGE
YOU0000002891_S0000212 AND IN INDIA MANY CITIES ARE DESTROYED UNDER THE ORDER CONVERT OR DIE
YOU0000002891_S0000223 THIS IS GOLDEN
YOU0000002891_S0000231 AND THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT TRAGEDIES
YOU0000002891_S0000236 NOBODY KNOWS THIS HISTORY
YOU0000002891_S0000241 ONE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU COME TO APPRECIATE WHEN YOU STUDY ISLAM IS THAT IT IS INFINITELY PATIENT
YOU0000002891_S0000251 I'M RECOVERING FROM AN ERROR
YOU0000002891_S0000261 THE ZOROASTRIAN PERSECUTION HAS INCREASED
YOU0000002891_S0000268 TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ARMENIAN CHRISTIANS ARE SLAUGHTERED IN TURKEY
YOU0000002891_S0000274 IT WAS A MEDITERRANEAN CIVILIZATION
YOU0000002891_S0000281 NOW THIS IS SOMETHING INTERESTING TODAY WE CONSIDER EGYPT FOR INSTANCE PART OF AFRICA
YOU0000002891_S0000291 WHAT WOULD START HAPPENING TO THE TRADE
YOU0000002891_S0000297 BEFORE ISLAM ROME COMMUNICATED WITH FRANCE BY SHIP
YOU0000002891_S0000304 WELL NOW THEN IF THERE'S NOT MUCH TRADE WITH THE CHRISTIANS
YOU0000002891_S0000311 ON OUR NEXT SLIDE
YOU0000002891_S0000319 CIVILIZATION BECAME ISOLATED AND QUITE POOR
YOU0000002891_S0000325 THERE WAS ONE IN EUROPE
YOU0000002891_S0000337 THIS HAPPENED SO FAST THAT THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT TO TAKE THESE BUILDINGS DOWN
YOU0000002891_S0000345 AND I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE REASON THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO KNOW THIS HISTORY
YOU0000002891_S0000353 SO WHAT WE HAD FROM CHRISTIANITY IN THE CLASSICAL SENSE WAS A BLOODY STUMP OF THE ORIGINAL CHRISTIANITY
YOU0000002891_S0000366 SO THIS WAS THE WORLD HE SAW
YOU0000002891_S0000379 THEY WENT INTO THE MUSLIM WORLD TO KILL WELL HOW DID THE MUSLIMS GET THERE
YOU0000002891_S0000388 IN OUR NEXT SLIDE
YOU0000002891_S0000400 THE FIRST ORDER FOR SLAVES CAME FROM THE CALIPH IN BAGHDAD AND HE REQUESTED HE SORT OF ISSUED A PURCHASE ORDER
YOU0000002891_S0000405 THIS IS ONE REASON THEY WANTED TO FIGHT
YOU0000002891_S0000415 I ASK THIS QUESTION
YOU0000002891_S0000429 WE'RE TOLD IS AN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY THAT THIS WAS A WONDERFUL GOLDEN AGE OF THOUGHT
YOU0000002891_S0000438 DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DOES TO SCIENCE
YOU0000002891_S0000450 THEY DENIED CAUSE AND EFFECT NOW THEN
YOU0000002891_S0000457 THEY WERE NOT DONE BY THE MUSLIMS
YOU0000002891_S0000468 SO HAS ANYTHING CHANGED
YOU0000002891_S0000481 TO KILL THE APOSTATES THE SHIA
YOU0000002891_S0000487 YOU NOW WE'VE ENJOYED BEING A MUSLIM BUT MOHAMMED'S DEAD SO WE'RE OUT OF HERE WE'RE GONE WE'RE GOING BACK TO WHAT WE WERE DOING BEFORE MOHAMMAD
YOU0000002891_S0000492 YOU KNOW THE ISLAM THING LOOKS GOOD TO US
YOU0000002891_S0000502 NOW THEN I BROKE THE DATA DOWN
YOU0000002891_S0000513 NOW I WANT TO READ THIS IN A DIFFERENT WAY JEW
YOU0000002891_S0000519 SO IT IS AGAINST THE SECULARISTS AS WELL
YOU0000002891_S0000527 SO WE CAN SAY THAT ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF PEACE NINE-PERCENT
YOU0000002891_S0000533 WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHY DOES IT NEVER STOP
YOU0000002891_S0000539 WELL THE POLE STAR ON OUR NEXT SLIDE IS
YOU0000002891_S0000550 WHY DO WE CARE WHAT MOHAMMED SAID AND DID
YOU0000002891_S0000555 SO THEREFORE WE CAN SAY THAT ISLAM IS FOURTEEN PERCENT ALLAH AND EIGHTY SIX PERCENT MOHAMMED
YOU0000002891_S0000560 THIS IS NOT AN OPINION
YOU0000002891_S0000567 IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT YOU AND ME
YOU0000002891_S0000577 AN EARLY KORAN AND A LATTER KORAN
YOU0000002891_S0000590 I LOVE FACTS
YOU0000002891_S0000597 THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL
YOU0000002891_S0000602 IMMIGRATION
YOU0000002891_S0000609 AND THEOLOGIANS AND HISTORIANS
YOU0000002891_S0000617 HERE WE SEE TURKEY
YOU0000002891_S0000625 CENTURIES
YOU0000002891_S0000630 IT'S NOW PRIMARILY ISLAMIC DO YOU KNOW WHY
YOU0000002891_S0000635 ON OUR NEXT SLIDE
YOU0000002891_S0000640 YOU CAN ASK THE QUESTION HOW MANY DIED UNDER STALIN
YOU0000002891_S0000655 THEY'RE LEFT BEHIND
YOU0000002891_S0000666 ON OUR NEXT SLIDE
YOU0000002891_S0000672 BUT THE ACT ITSELF WAS POLITICAL
YOU0000002891_S0000680 BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE SOMETHING OUT
YOU0000002891_S0000691 WHY ISN'T THIS COMMON KNOWLEDGE
YOU0000002891_S0000698 THE MUSLIMS ARE CALLED ASIAN
YOU0000002891_S0000705 IT'S VERY DIFFERENT WHEN YOU STUDY THE ROOT CAUSE
YOU0000002891_S0000712 IT'S ONLY THOSE OUTSIDE THE ESTABLISHMENT WHO ARE CRITICS OF ISLAM AND I'M NOT REALLY A CRITIC OF ISLAM
YOU0000002891_S0000718 I SELL A KORAN WHICH ANY PERSON CAN PICK UP AND READ
YOU0000002891_S0000724 BESIDES THEY WEREN'T TAUGHT IT WAS EASY ANYWAY
YOU0000002891_S0000731 AND THEN IN AMERICA THE SUM OF ISLAM IS CALLED THE GOLDEN AGE
YOU0000002891_S0000741 WHY IS THAT
YOU0000002891_S0000751 AND THEN THERE'S THIS ELEMENT OF YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE PHYSICALLY THREATENED
YOU0000002891_S0000758 OH YOU NEED SHARIA FINE
YOU0000002891_S0000767 SEDAN AND OTHER AREAS IT IS SOMETHING YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT
YOU0000002891_S0000775 WHY ARE FACTS INSULTS
YOU0000002891_S0000781 IF WE HAD THE RIGHT FOREIGN POLICY EVERYTHING WOULD BE GOOD
YOU0000002891_S0000789 ANGER TURNS INWARD
YOU0000002891_S0000794 BUT THAT IS TO START EXAMINING HIS POLICIES IS THE BEGINNING OF CRITICAL THOUGHT
YOU0000002891_S0000800 THEY SAY I AM AN IMMORAL PERSON
YOU0000002891_S0000808 FOR INSTANCE TURKEY DENIES THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE THERE WAS NO GENOCIDE
YOU0000002891_S0000815 THE ABUSER EXPECTS SUBMISSION

YOU0000002914_S0000105 UNLIKE ANY OTHER EVENT PREVIOUSLY
YOU0000002914_S0000113 AS IN OTHER GENOCIDES RIGHT ARMENIANS WERE DENIGRATED
YOU0000002914_S0000121 AFTER HAVING DEHUMANIZED THE ARMENIAN SUBJECTS OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE THEY THEN SYSTEMATICALLY WENT ABOUT ELIMINATING THEM
YOU0000002914_S0000136 OBVIOUSLY WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH
YOU0000002914_S0000143 THEN PACKED INTO THESE CARS
YOU0000002914_S0000151 ARMENIANS WERE GATHERED IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS
YOU0000002914_S0000160 AND THEY WERE TOLD THAT UPON THEIR RETURN THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO RECLAIM THEM
YOU0000002914_S0000173 THE GENOCIDE CONTINUES AS I MENTIONED TO BE DENIED BY THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
YOU0000002928_S0000007 BUT THE DECEMBRIST REVOLT AS IT BECAME KNOWN

YOU0000002928_S0000027 WAS CRUSHED BY RUSSIAN TROOPS
YOU0000002928_S0000033 THE EMPEROR'S WILLINGNESS TO HELP SUPPRESS LIBERAL REVOLTS WON HIM THE NICKNAME THE GENDARME
YOU0000002928_S0000038 A LEADING INTELLECTUAL CRITIC OF RUSSIA'S AUTOCRACY

YOU0000002928_S0000048 IN THE BALTIC
YOU0000002928_S0000055 THE CRIMEAN WAR HAD EXPOSED RUSSIA'S WEAKNESS THE COUNTRY LAGGED FAR BEHIND ITS EUROPEAN RIVALS IN INDUSTRY
YOU0000002928_S0000060 THE MOST OBVIOUS SIGN OF RUSSIA'S BACKWARDNESS WAS SERFDOM

YOU0000002936_S0000346 THE DIVIDE WITH THE REPUBLICANS WAS WIDENING
YOU0000002936_S0000351 NOW IS WHEN WE MUST BRING THE BEST IDEAS OF BOTH PARTIES TOGETHER AND SHOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT WE CAN STILL DO WHAT WE WERE SENT HERE TO DO
YOU0000002936_S0000357 THE REFORMS

YOU0000002936_S0000473 THE CONVENTIONAL WAY IN WASHINGTON OF ABSORBING A JOKE AT THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER IS TO KEEP YOUR CHIN UP AND AT LEAST PRETEND TO HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT IT EVEN IF YOU GO CRY INTO YOUR PILLOW THAT NIGHT
YOU0000002936_S0000480 THE MEN'S COOKING TEAM DID NOT IMPRESS THE JUDGES FROM OMAHA STEAKS

YOU0000002936_S0000553 BOEHNER TO RAISE TAXES
YOU0000002936_S0000563 HE NEVER HAD ANY CONTROL OF THIS CAUCUS AND WHENEVER HE TOOK ANYTHING BACK TO HIS CAUCUS THEY JUST TORE HIM APART AND ATE HIM ALIVE

YOU0000002968_S0000060 BUT IT'S EVEN MORE THAN THAT
YOU0000002968_S0000066 THE QUESTION BEHIND THE TECHIES WORLD VIEW IS
YOU0000002968_S0000074 THERE IS A SIMPLE FACT THAT OFTEN GETS OVERLOOKED
YOU0000002968_S0000082 I WAS INVITED TO LEAD A CERTAIN BIBLE STUDY GROUP IN I'M THINKING YEAH CATHOLICS WE DON'T DO BIBLE STUDY THANK YOU
YOU0000002968_S0000089 HE WAS A SEVEN-DAY CREATIONIST
YOU0000002968_S0000096 AND THEN HE TOLD ME WHAT HE HAD DONE FOR A LIVING BEFORE HE WAS AN ASTRONAUT
YOU0000002968_S0000102 YOU JUST DON'T WANT THOSE PEOPLE TO GO WITH YOU TO THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART
YOU0000002968_S0000108 WAS A BLUE-COLLARED CHURCH
YOU0000002968_S0000114 AND THANKS TO ALL THOSE JESUIT UNIVERSITIES
YOU0000002968_S0000120 YEAH I DON'T WANT TO BE AFFECTED NO THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY MEANT

YOU0000002968_S0000181 BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT ALLEN WOULD BE PUT OFF BY BAD LITURGIES AND BETH BY FRAUDULENT THEOLOGY
YOU0000002968_S0000186 ALLEN WAS PUT OFF BY THE QUAKERS AS BEING TOO FLAKY
YOU0000002968_S0000192 THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A RELIGION THAT'S CLOSEST TO THE TRUTH
YOU0000002968_S0000199 ANY GUESSES
YOU0000002968_S0000205 WHICH IS REALLY ODD BECAUSE MY THESIS ADVISER AT MIT WAS A MORMON
YOU0000002968_S0000212 TO THE TECHIE THE QUESTION ISN'T SO MUCH A SEARCH FOR THE PROOF OF GOD'S EXISTENCE BUT RATHER
YOU0000002968_S0000217 IT ANSWERS LEIBNIZ'S FAMOUS QUESTION WHY IS THERE SOMETHING INSTEAD OF NOTHING
YOU0000002968_S0000224 WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AND HOW COME NOBODY'S TOLD ME THAT
YOU0000002968_S0000232 THEIR HOME IS MORE SPARSELY FURNISHED
YOU0000002968_S0000237 AND AS SHE SAYS
YOU0000002968_S0000244 YOUTH GROUP IN OUR PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH
YOU0000002968_S0000251 WHEN I TELL NON-TECHIES THAT ANECDOTE THEY BREAK OUT LAUGHING
YOU0000002968_S0000257 IF ALL RELIGIONS ARE TRYING TO GET YOU TO RELATE TO THE SAME ONE TRUE GOD HOW COME THERE'S SO MANY OF THEM
YOU0000002968_S0000264 I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT SERIES APPROXIMATION IS HERE
YOU0000002968_S0000271 THE ONLY THING THAT TELLS ME I'M NOT BACK IN DETROIT WHERE I GREW UP IS I CAN SMELL THE SALT FROM THE OCEAN
YOU0000002968_S0000279 AND I WAS ORIGINALLY GOING TO CALL HIM JUSTIN AND HE SAID DON'T NAME ME FOR A BOY SINGER
YOU0000002968_S0000286 AND THERE ARE TWENTY SEVEN UNMARKED JARS OF LITTLE LEAFY POWDERS
YOU0000002968_S0000355 AND SO YOU CAN SAY OKAY

YOU0000002968_S0000374 OKAY
YOU0000002968_S0000380 YOU THINK YOU'RE SELLING TRUTH YOUR CUSTOMERS ALREADY HAVE TRUTH
YOU0000002968_S0000386 JULIAN ORR

YOU0000002968_S0000411 AND THEN IT HITS ME
YOU0000002968_S0000418 AND I FIND EXACTLY THE PERFECT ILLUSTRATION OF THIS POINT A FEW DAYS LATER
YOU0000002968_S0000424 HE WANTS SERIOUS CONTENT TO HIS CHURCH
YOU0000002968_S0000429 ATTEMPTING TO LIVE LIVING IN A PERMANENT COMMITTED GAY RELATIONSHIP AND I CAN SEE THE WAY THE GEARS ARE WORKING BECAUSE
YOU0000002968_S0000437 IT'S THE COMMITMENT THAT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN TO THEIR VARIOUS FAITHS
YOU0000002968_S0000444 WHEN YOU COULD CONTEMPLATE THE BIG QUESTIONS OF LIFE YOU KNOW
YOU0000002968_S0000449 TO FEEL COMFORTABLE IN DOING ALL OF THE ABOVE
YOU0000002968_S0000455 BUT MEDITATION AND PRAYER IS A SPIRITUALITY WHICH IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM RELIGION
YOU0000002968_S0000462 I COULD SEE WHY THIS COULD BE REALLY APPEALING
YOU0000002968_S0000469 I HAVE A HUNCH THAT THOSE TECHIES WHO DO BELONG TO A CHURCH
YOU0000002968_S0000475 IT IS PRECISELY FOR THE GOD STUFF

YOU0000002968_S0000488 IT'S JUST A CULTURAL THING AND THIS IS THE CULTURE WE'RE IN
YOU0000002968_S0000494 I WASN'T RAISING ANYTHING NEW THAT THEY HADN'T ALREADY THEMSELVES THOUGHT THROUGH
YOU0000002968_S0000500 ABOUT THE WORLD IS A BASIC HUMAN TRAIT
YOU0000002968_S0000505 THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND TECHNOLOGY THE ABILITY TO BE A TECHIE IS A SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUE
YOU0000002968_S0000510 AND WHAT DID THEY ASK ME TO DO TEACH THEM ASTRONOMY

YOU0000003016_S0000013 HI I'M SELENA
YOU0000003016_S0000029 MY BACKGROUND ORIGINALLY
YOU0000003016_S0000036 AND I LAUNCHED A COMPANY THREE YEARS AGO CALLED FAMILY VIDEO NETWORK WHERE I CURATE TOGETHER FAMILY FRIENDLY KID FRIENDLY BRAND SAFE CONTENT CREATORS
YOU0000003016_S0000060 UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUDIENCE MAY WANT HOW DO YOU GET YOUR AUDIENCE'S ATTENTION
YOU0000003016_S0000080 YOU KNOW

YOU0000003016_S0000128 SO SINCE SHE TALKED ABOUT LIVESTREAM AND CHRIS TALKED ABOUT LIVESTREAM LET'S MAKE A PIVOT TO LIVESTREAMING IN DIFFERENT WAYS BECAUSE SELENA YOU LIVESTREAM ON INSTAGRAM
YOU0000003016_S0000149 SO ITS' REAL LIFE YOU SEE THE PICTURE OF REAL LIFE AND THEN YOU PLACE THE VIRTUAL CHARACTERS ON TOP OF REAL LIFE
YOU0000003016_S0000165 SO HERE WE ARE AGAIN WITH LIKE NOW
YOU0000003016_S0000172 AND EVERY PIECE OF CONTENT I CREATE IS AROUND WHAT THIS PERSON WHOSE
YOU0000003016_S0000199 OH YEAH CAN WE HAVE THE BOX WHERE IS THE BOX
YOU0000003016_S0000206 NO YOU HAVE TO THROW IT THAT'S THE FUN OF
YOU0000003016_S0000217 YOU KNOW
YOU0000003016_S0000234 THEN I FIGURE OUT WHY AND I TRY THE SAME THING BUT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
YOU0000003016_S0000242 WITH EVERYTHING THERE'S A CALL TO ACTION
YOU0000003024_S0000009 SO OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS POLINA GOLLAND
YOU0000003024_S0000017 IN APPLICATION TO NEURO-IMAGING WHICH IS WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY
YOU0000003024_S0000031 THAT YOU RARELY FIND ANYTHING VERY SPECIFIC
YOU0000003024_S0000036 FOR EXAMPLE
YOU0000003024_S0000046 AND THEN EVERYBODY IS ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THOSE
YOU0000003024_S0000054 WE FIND THESE THREE TEMPLATES
YOU0000003024_S0000064 A MORE SUBTLE DIFFERENCE IS IF YOU LOOK IN THIS AREA
YOU0000003024_S0000073 SO MY STUDENTS DECIDED TO CALL IT THE YOUNG THE MIDDLE AGE AND THE OLD POPULATION
YOU0000003024_S0000078 AND MORE INTERESTINGLY IF WE ALLOW MORE RICHNESS AND ASK FOR THREE TEMPLATES
YOU0000003024_S0000083 NOW ON TOP OF THE STRUCTURE THAT WE DISCOVERED IN THE IMAGES WITHOUT ANY SUGGESTION OF OUTSIDE INFORMATION
YOU0000003024_S0000092 AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE A MUCH MORE CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
YOU0000003024_S0000111 HOWEVER THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE DO THIS GIVEN THAT MOBILE VIDEO TODAY SUFFERS FROM GLITCHES AND STALLS ALL THE TIME
YOU0000003024_S0000120 AND WIRELESS VIDEO CAN NOT DEAL WITH SUCH VARIATIONS
YOU0000003024_S0000128 THE VIDEO DOES NOT IMPROVE WITH IMPROVED CHANNEL QUALITY
YOU0000003024_S0000141 AND THE CHANNEL CODE
YOU0000003024_S0000151 SO TODAY
YOU0000003024_S0000156 SO HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
YOU0000003024_S0000163 SO AS A RESULT OF THIS LINEARITY
YOU0000003024_S0000170 SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN BY THIS SAY THAT THIS IS YOUR MOBILE VIDEO
YOU0000003024_S0000180 BY DROPPING ALL THE FREQUENCIES ABOVE CERTAIN THRESHOLD
YOU0000003024_S0000187 AND FIND THE OPTIMAL LINEAR CODES THAT CAN MINIMIZE THE VIDEO ERROR AT THE RECEIVER
YOU0000003024_S0000199 AND IN THIS DEMO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MOBILE RECEIVER WHICH IS A CELL PHONE UP THERE
YOU0000003024_S0000213 LAST SPEAKER OF THE SESSION IS ROB MILLER
YOU0000003024_S0000220 TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT ARE REALLY TOO HARD FOR US TO KNOW HOW TO DO WITH SOFTWARE ALONE
YOU0000003032_S0000006 BECAUSE
YOU0000003032_S0000012 WAS THE REACTION
YOU0000003032_S0000019 LATER ON
YOU0000003032_S0000026 AND WHEN THERE WAS A REBELLION IN SPAIN
YOU0000003032_S0000033 BUT FROM THAT TIME ON THE RUSSIAN TSARS BECAME VERY AWARE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIGHT THE REVOLUTION
YOU0000003032_S0000038 THAT IS
YOU0000003032_S0000044 EVEN THOUGH METTERNICH THE GREAT STATESMAN WARNED HIM THAT THEY WERE ALSO MASONS AND REBELS JUST LIKE THE REST OF THEM
YOU0000003032_S0000052 THE LEADING STATESMAN OF THIS TIME IN THE WEST OF EUROPE WAS METTERNICH
YOU0000003032_S0000060 THAT IS
YOU0000003032_S0000066 A PATRON OF THE ARTS
YOU0000003032_S0000083 DONOSO CORTES
YOU0000003032_S0000088 AGAINST THE REVOLUTION
YOU0000003032_S0000095 IN ORDER TO DEFEAT IT YOU MUST HAVE A DIFFERENT THEOLOGY
YOU0000003032_S0000100 IS QUITE PROFOUND
YOU0000003032_S0000106 IT IS WONDERFUL HOW WE EVER STUMBLE ON THEOLOGY IN ALL OUR POLITICAL QUESTIONS THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO CAUSE SURPRISE EXCEPT THE SURPRISE OF MONSIEUR PROUDHON
YOU0000003032_S0000113 BECAUSE HE SEES IT'S ONLY A HALFWAY BETWEEN SOCIALISM AND MONARCHY
YOU0000003032_S0000132 THE SOCIALIST SCHOOLS
YOU0000003032_S0000138 SINCE IT HATES CATHOLICISM
YOU0000003032_S0000145 THE TWO AFFIRMATIONS OF CATHOLICISM ARE SENSIBLE AND NATURAL
YOU0000003032_S0000152 WHAT
YOU0000003032_S0000158 HE SAW THAT HE BELIEVED THAT RUSSIA
YOU0000003032_S0000163 WE'LL SEE WHAT THE NEXT THINKER THINKS ABOUT RUSSIA
YOU0000003032_S0000168 D E M A I S T R E
YOU0000003032_S0000173 AND AFTER NAPOLEON
YOU0000003032_S0000182 AND THEREFORE THIS KING THOUGHT HE WAS AGAINST HIM
YOU0000003032_S0000188 YOU SEE
YOU0000003032_S0000193 THE ANSWER TO THE REVOLUTION
YOU0000003032_S0000198 IN FACT
YOU0000003032_S0000205 AND HE'S RATHER A COLD THINKER
YOU0000003032_S0000210 BEGIN WITHOUT GOD AND THEREFORE THEY END IN ABSURDITY
YOU0000003032_S0000217 THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
YOU0000003032_S0000222 THEN BY HIS NOBLES
YOU0000003032_S0000228 IT'S SOMETHING WHICH COMES OUT OF THE EXPERIENCE OF A WHOLE NATION
YOU0000003032_S0000238 THESE PEOPLE
YOU0000003032_S0000244 BECAUSE HE WAS SO VERY ANTI-REVOLUTIONARY AND THE SAME TIME WAS VERY RATIONAL HE CAME TO NEW CONCLUSIONS WHICH WERE NOT IN THE EUROPEAN PHILOSOPHY OF THE PAST
YOU0000003032_S0000253 IN FACT
YOU0000003032_S0000260 THE POPE HIMSELF IS THE ONE OUTWARD STANDARD YOU CAN SEE WHICH WILL PROTECT YOU FROM THE REVOLUTION
YOU0000003032_S0000265 BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE LEADING TEXTBOOKS OF ULTRAMONTANISM SO-CALLED
YOU0000003032_S0000270 BECAUSE HE SAW THE TRADITION IS DYING OFF
YOU0000003032_S0000276 ON THE POPE
YOU0000003032_S0000284 IN FACT
YOU0000003032_S0000289 BECAUSE HE PUTS IT BACK ONLY TO THE RENAISSANCE
YOU0000003032_S0000295 NOW WE HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF THING
YOU0000003032_S0000300 AS I SAID IN THE LAST LECTURE NICHOLAS I WAS AN EXEMPLARY MONARCH IN THE PURE TRADITION OF RUSSIAN ABSOLUTISM
YOU0000003032_S0000305 HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE REVOLUTION
YOU0000003032_S0000313 AND AS WE NOW COME TO RUSSIA
YOU0000003032_S0000318 AND THEY'RE LACKING SOME KIND OF DEEPER ROOTEDNESS IN TRADITION
YOU0000003032_S0000324 BUT ARE CONCLUSIONS OF SOMEBODY WHO FEELS WHAT IS THE TRADITION OF RELIGION
YOU0000003032_S0000329 NOT JUST IN MIND BUT HIS WHOLE LIFE
YOU0000003032_S0000338 DURING THE TIME OF THE WAR FOR THE FATHERLAND
YOU0000003032_S0000343 I AM ASHAMED HE SAID
YOU0000003032_S0000351 THIS CONVERSATION FINISHED
YOU0000003032_S0000361 I WILL BE UNWAVERING
YOU0000003032_S0000370 BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE KEPT A STRICTNESS
YOU0000003032_S0000379 HE SHOULD BE GIVEN PAPER FOR WRITING
YOU0000003032_S0000384 SINCE BATENKOV IS SICK AND WOUNDED
YOU0000003032_S0000389 BOOKS OF RELIGIOUS CONTENT
YOU0000003032_S0000395 HE WOULD READ THE LETTERS
YOU0000003032_S0000402 THREE DAYS AGO THE EMPEROR SENT YOUR LETTER AND RIGHT AFTER IT TWO THOUSAND RUBLES
YOU0000003032_S0000407 GENERAL LEPARSKY
YOU0000003032_S0000416 MANY SPECTATORS WERE PRESENT
YOU0000003032_S0000423 OUT OF THE RANKS
YOU0000003032_S0000429 AND HERE AND BEFORE SIXTY THOUSAND TROOPS AND MANY THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS
YOU0000003032_S0000434 HAVING KISSED THE HAND OF THE EMPEROR LVOV WHO WAS THUS MADE SO HAPPY RETURNED TO HIS PLACE
YOU0000003032_S0000441 BUT WE SEE ON ANOTHER OCCASION WHAT HAPPENED
YOU0000003032_S0000448 AND BY THE WAY
YOU0000003032_S0000453 HAVING READ THE PETITION THE SOVEREIGN RETURNED IT TO THE PETITIONER AND SHARPLY DECLARED
YOU0000003032_S0000458 THERE WAS A DOUBLE DOOR INTO THIS OFFICE
YOU0000003032_S0000463 GREAT TEARS WERE COMING OUT OF HIS EYES
YOU0000003032_S0000469 THAT WOULD BE WEAKNESS
YOU0000003032_S0000476 AND WE'LL FORGIVE YOU AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE
YOU0000003032_S0000483 OR EVEN THE WESTERN KINGS WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY GOVERNING PEOPLE OF ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT BELIEFS
YOU0000003032_S0000488 VERY PATRIARCHAL
YOU0000003032_S0000494 HE CAME TO THE TENTS WHERE THEY WERE AND HE COMMANDED
YOU0000003032_S0000500 AND SOME JUST IN THEIR UNDERWEAR
YOU0000003032_S0000506 DRESSED ONLY IN HIS UNDERWEAR HAD CLIMBED A TREE TO SEE THE TSAR BETTER
YOU0000003032_S0000513 THIS WHOLE SCENE
YOU0000003032_S0000519 THE MAIN THING ABOUT HIS SPIRITUAL MAKEUP WAS HIS ORTHODOX FAITH
YOU0000003032_S0000524 CROSSING MYSELF I GAVE MYSELF OVER TO THE HANDS OF GOD AND DECIDED TO GO MYSELF WHEREVER THE DANGER THREATENED GREATEST AND HE ADMITTED LATER THAT AT THIS TIME BESIDES THIS DECISION
YOU0000003032_S0000529 I FEEL THAT I'VE BROKEN MY SHOULDER
YOU0000003032_S0000538 I AM HOPING ALL THE TIME THAT THIS WILL PASS AS HE GROWS UP SO THAT
YOU0000003032_S0000544 OF COURSE
YOU0000003032_S0000550 AREN'T YOU HAPPY NOW
YOU0000003032_S0000559 THE EASTERN QUESTION WHICH THE WESTERN DIPLOMATS WERE SO OCCUPIED WITH THEN
YOU0000003032_S0000565 BY THE PARADOXES OF OUR OWN GOVERNMENT PEOPLE
YOU0000003032_S0000571 AND BREAKING TREATIES AS THOUGH THEY'RE NOTHING
YOU0000003032_S0000577 AT THE GOVERNANCE OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS
YOU0000003032_S0000582 IN A WORD
YOU0000003032_S0000587 AND
YOU0000003032_S0000596 THE TSAR WAS KIND
YOU0000003032_S0000601 THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA AND OF GERMANY
YOU0000003032_S0000607 YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE STANDING FOR MONARCHY
YOU0000003032_S0000612 THIS SPANISH WRITER CONTINUES
YOU0000003032_S0000618 EMPEROR NICHOLAS WAS A DEVOTED MAN
YOU0000003032_S0000623 THE PEOPLE BLESSED HIS NAME AND ONE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE WHOLE OF EUROPE IS OBLIGED TO HIM FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE ORDER
YOU0000003032_S0000629 THE DOCTOR WHO ATTENDED HIM SAID THE FOLLOWING FROM THE TIME WHEN I BEGAN MY MEDICAL PRACTICE
YOU0000003032_S0000634 I WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THIS IMPOSSIBLE IF I HAVE HAD NOT HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO LIVE TO SEE ALL THIS MAN DIE THE EMPRESS ALEXANDRA FEODOREVNA OFFERED TO THE TSAR AS HE WAS DYING
YOU0000003032_S0000640 ANOTHER EYEWITNESS OF THE LAST HOURS OF THE LIFE OF THE SOVEREIGN EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT HAD AN ATHEIST BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE ROOM OF THE TSAR THEN
YOU0000003032_S0000645 NOW LETTEST THOU THY SERVANT DEPART IN PEACE
YOU0000003032_S0000650 FOR THIS WAS NOT ACCORDING TO ORTHODOX CUSTOM HE ASKED THAT THERE BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN WITH HIM
YOU0000003032_S0000658 TO THE HEIR TO THE THRONE HE SPECIALLY RECOMMENDED COUNT ALDERBURG SAYING
YOU0000003032_S0000663 AND IN HIS BIDDING FAREWELL TO HER HE SAID
YOU0000003032_S0000668 I MUST BE LEFT ALONE SO AS TO PREPARE MYSELF FOR THE FINAL MOMENT
YOU0000003032_S0000673 HE ASKED THE TSAREVITCH TO GIVE HIS GREETINGS ALSO TO THE GUARDS TO THE ARMY
YOU0000003032_S0000698 THAT YOU NEED TO BE CALM
YOU0000003032_S0000704 THIS IS AS CLEAR AS DAY TO ME
YOU0000003032_S0000710 BY IRON AND BLOOD
YOU0000003032_S0000717 YOUR MAJESTY THE ONLY ONE SURE
YOU0000003032_S0000722 THE WHOLE NATION AWAITS THIS AUTHORITATIVE DECISION AND AS SOON AS THEY SENSE THE SOVEREIGN WILL
YOU0000003032_S0000730 BUT IN THE MEANTIME LORIS-MELIKOV HAD ALREADY PREPARED THE TRIUMPHANT PUBLICATION OF THIS
YOU0000003032_S0000736 IF ONLY FOR FIFTEEN DAYS
YOU0000003032_S0000742 ADDED THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN DECIDED BY THE REPOSED AND THAT IT WAS IN DOUBT AND HE ASKED ALL TO SPEAK WITHOUT CONSTRAINT
YOU0000003032_S0000748 THERE IS NO TIME TO DESCRIBE ALL THIS IN DETAIL
YOU0000003032_S0000753 MILYUTIN AT THIS TIME MADE A SLIP OF THE TONGUE
YOU0000003032_S0000759 I COULD NO LONGER HOLD BACK THE WAVES OF MY INDIGNATION
YOU0000003032_S0000765 WHAT HAD WE BEEN DOING ALL THIS TIME AND DURING HIS REIGN
YOU0000003032_S0000771 WHAT HAD WE DONE TO PROTECT HIM
YOU0000003032_S0000776 THAT IS
YOU0000003032_S0000781 THOSE ADJACENT TO ME
YOU0000003032_S0000790 AND THAT HE DID NOT EXCLUDE HIMSELF
YOU0000003032_S0000820 HE WAS IN GREAT PAIN
YOU0000003032_S0000834 HAVING HIMSELF BEEN DEEPLY INFECTED BY REVOLUTIONARY DISEASE
YOU0000003032_S0000842 THERE WAS ONE GROUP CALLED PETROCHEVSKY GROUP
YOU0000003032_S0000847 THEY HAD NO ORGANIZATION
YOU0000003032_S0000854 THAT IS
YOU0000003032_S0000859 BUT FOURIER WAS DREAMING ABOUT PARADISE WITH LEMONADE FOUNTAINS AND ALL KINDS OF IMAGES LIKE THAT
YOU0000003032_S0000864 THAT IS
YOU0000003032_S0000870 HE HAD A VERY PERSONAL INTEREST IN THE FATE OF EACH SUBJECT
YOU0000003032_S0000875 AND IN THE CASE OF DOSTOYEVSKY
YOU0000003032_S0000884 WHAT HAS HE DONE
YOU0000003032_S0000889 HE LIVED EIGHT YEARS IN SIBERIA HE LIVED A VERY HARD LIFE
YOU0000003032_S0000895 THEN HE DESCRIBES TSARIST PRISONS IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE TSARIST PRISONS WERE QUITE LUXURIOUS COMPARED TO THE COMMUNIST PRISONS
YOU0000003032_S0000901 BUT HE WENT THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE WHICH
YOU0000003032_S0000907 IT MEANS THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DEEP HAPPENING IN HIM
YOU0000003032_S0000912 BUT AT THE SAME TIME
YOU0000003032_S0000921 ALL THE GUESTS WERE SITTING DOWN TOO
YOU0000003032_S0000926 I BELIEVE THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE HAD COME TOGETHER IN THE AGREEABLE EXPECTATION OF HEARING SOMETHING PARTICULARLY INTERESTING
YOU0000003032_S0000933 PYOTR VERKOVENSKY HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING TOGETHER A QUINTET AMONGST US LIKE THE ONE HE HAD ALREADY FORMED IN MOSCOW AND
YOU0000003032_S0000954 THAT MY SYSTEM IS NOT YET COMPLETE
YOU0000003032_S0000960 THE LAUGHTER GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER
YOU0000003032_S0000966 AND HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO DESPAIR YOURSELF
YOU0000003032_S0000971 YES
YOU0000003032_S0000976 AND SO I HASTEN WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME TO INVITE THE WHOLE SOCIETY TO LISTEN FOR TEN EVENINGS TO MY BOOK AND THEN GIVE THEIR OPINIONS OF IT
YOU0000003032_S0000982 THERE WAS A STIR IN THE COMPANY
YOU0000003032_S0000987 LYAMSHIN COMMENTED

YOU0000003032_S0001007 ATTAIN PRIMEVAL INNOCENCE
YOU0000003032_S0001014 BUT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DOUBT THE INTELLIGENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE AUTHOR
YOU0000003032_S0001020 YOU SAY THAT OF YOUR OWN BROTHER
YOU0000003032_S0001026 OBSERVED THE GIRL-STUDENT FIERCELY
YOU0000003032_S0001031 IF I DIDN T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH NINETENTHS OF MANKIND

YOU0000003032_S0001092 YET WE KNOW THAT SO FAR NOTHING HAS HAPPENED IN THE WORLD NEW ENOUGH TO BE WORTH OUR WEEPING AT HAVING MISSED IT
YOU0000003032_S0001097 ONE CAN JUMP OVER THE DITCH MORE SAFELY
YOU0000003032_S0001102 WELL BUT I HAVEN T COME HERE FOR DISCUSSION
YOU0000003032_S0001107 IT S A PITY
YOU0000003032_S0001112 TO REMOVE A HUNDRED MILLION HEADS IS AS DIFFICULT AS TO TRANSFORM THE WORLD BY PROPAGANDA
YOU0000003032_S0001118 WE KNOW THAT A MYSTERIOUS FINGER IS POINTING TO OUR DELIGHTFUL COUNTRY AS THE LAND MOST FITTED TO ACCOMPLISH THE GREAT TASK
YOU0000003032_S0001124 BY THE RAPID METHOD OF CUTTING OFF A HUNDRED MILLION HEADS
YOU0000003032_S0001129 OBSERVED VERKOVENSKY
YOU0000003032_S0001135 HE WAS ONE OF THE INTELLECTS OF THE PROVINCE
YOU0000003032_S0001155 THEREFORE YOU MUST DO SOMETHING WHICH IS SPECTACULAR

YOU0000003102_S0000061 CLIMATE CHANGE IS ONE OF THE GREAT TESTS OF JOURNALISM
YOU0000003102_S0000071 RATHER THAN THE MESSAGE WHICH IS
YOU0000003102_S0000087 THEY HAVE STUFF WHICH THEY THINK PUSHES THE BUTTONS THAT MAKES PEOPLE EMOTIONAL AND ANGRY
YOU0000003102_S0000098 BUT IT'S GOING TO BE BUSINESS AS USUAL OUR HEARTS WILL BE BROKEN
YOU0000003102_S0000107 THEIR LEARNED HELPLESSNESS WAS OVERWHELMED
YOU0000003102_S0000113 IN OUR CASE WE HAVE AN OLD DEMOCRACY WHICH HAS OSSIFIED THE NARRATIVE SHOULD BE THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN LET'S FIX IT THE FOUNDERS WERE NOT MOSES OR GOD AND WHAT THEY PUT IN THE CONSTITUTION THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE

YOU0000003102_S0000165 AND I KEEP LEARNING EACH DAY THE SAME THING SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED AND NOTHING WAS DONE ABOUT IT THAT'S THE NEWS THE MORE THAT THAT'S THE CASE
YOU0000003102_S0000174 IT DRAWS OTHER PEOPLE INTO IT THE INTERNET HAS BEEN
YOU0000003102_S0000181 WE'VE SEEN COLLECTIVE ACTION WORK BEFORE TO MAKE THIS A BETTER COUNTRY
YOU0000003102_S0000189 TO SECURE FOR THEMSELVES
YOU0000003102_S0000194 WHO MUST OVERCOME THE CRIPPLING LEGACY OF BIGOTRY AND INJUSTICE
YOU0000003102_S0000200 AND HAVE TRIED EVER SINCE TO NULLIFY IT
YOU0000003102_S0000207 SEVERAL OF THOSE STATES IMMEDIATELY SET OUT TO IMPLEMENT RESTRICTIVE NEW VOTING LAWS THAT BEFORE THE RULING WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND DISCRIMINATORY
YOU0000003102_S0000212 YOU WILL NOT FIND IN ONE VOLUME A MORE COMPELLING STORY OF THE HEROIC MEN AND WOMEN WHO STRUGGLED FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE
YOU0000003102_S0000220 HERE ARE THESE FIVE MEN
YOU0000003102_S0000230 YOU ARE NOT AS EVIL A MAN AS YOU ACT YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEART WHAT IS RIGHT
YOU0000003102_S0000236 YOU CAN TURN YOUR BACK NOW AND YOU CAN KEEP THE CLUB IN YOUR HAND BUT YOU CANNOT BEAT DOWN JUSTICE
YOU0000003102_S0000244 HE DID THAT AND THE
YOU0000003102_S0000249 ALMOST A MOB OF ALABAMA POLICE LOCAL POLICE JIM CLARK WAS THERE AS WELL
YOU0000003102_S0000259 AND
YOU0000003102_S0000277 PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE THERE THEY GOT THEIR CAMERAMAN THEY GOT THE FILM BACK TO NEW YORK VERY QUICKLY
YOU0000003102_S0000289 AND A PROGRESSIVE PRESIDENT
YOU0000003102_S0000299 OR THE HOUR IS LATE
YOU0000003102_S0000304 OR BECAUSE HE ABBREVIATED A WORD ON THE APPLICATION
YOU0000003102_S0000309 OR EXPLAIN THE MOST COMPLEX PROVISIONS OF STATE LAW
YOU0000003102_S0000314 NO LAW THAT WE NOW HAVE ON THE BOOKS AND I HAVE HELPED TO PUT THREE OF THEM THERE
YOU0000003102_S0000327 WAS AS A TEACHER
YOU0000003102_S0000334 THEY NEVER SEEMED TO KNOW WHY PEOPLE DISLIKED THEM
YOU0000003102_S0000341 AND TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE THEM ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY
YOU0000003102_S0000358 WE DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE
YOU0000003102_S0000363 PROBLEMS REMAIN IN THOSE STATES THE JUSTICE SAID
YOU0000003102_S0000374 THEY'D GO TO CHURCH THEY'D GO TO THE POLLS IT'S TAKING YOUR SOUL TO THE POLLS
YOU0000003102_S0000386 SAID THAT THE BILL HAD BEEN DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE THE MOST EGREGIOUS OF DIFFICULTIES
YOU0000003102_S0000397 TO BE FAIR SHOULD WE ACCEPT THAT MAYBE THOSE FIVE JUSTICES HAVE THEIR OWN SET OF POLITICAL PRINCIPLES
YOU0000003102_S0000407 IS THAT UNFAIR
YOU0000003102_S0000425 SO THIS WAS A POWER GIVEN TO THE CONGRESS
YOU0000003102_S0000435 ENDORSEMENT OF
YOU0000003102_S0000444 AND YOU CAN VIEW ONLINE THE NEW DOCUMENTARY ON THE ECONOMIC STRUGGLE OF TWO AMERICAN FAMILIES PRODUCED FOR THE PBS SERIES FRONTLINE
YOU0000003102_S0000453 INDEPENDENT PRODUCTION FUND
YOU0000003102_S0000458 THE HERB ALPERT FOUNDATION SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS WHOSE MISSION IS TO PROMOTE COMPASSION AND CREATIVITY IN OUR SOCIETY
YOU0000003102_S0000463 THE BETSY AND JESSE FINK FOUNDATION
YOU0000003114_S0000004 AND REALLY THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY FARMERS WHO WANTED A FAIR SHAKE
YOU0000003114_S0000015 BE A PART OF THEIR OWN DESTINY IS REALLY THE REASON THAT THE BANK EXISTS
YOU0000003114_S0000022 THE PRICES THAT THEY GOT FOR THE GRAIN AND THE COST OF THEIR SEED THEY HAD NO CONTROL OVER
YOU0000003114_S0000027 BUT YEAR AFTER YEAR
YOU0000003114_S0000039 AND YOU HAD IN A C TOWNLEY A CHARISMATIC LEADER SOMEONE WHO KNEW HOW TO ORGANIZE
YOU0000003114_S0000046 TOWNLEY'S NONPARTISAN LEAGUE SWEPT ACROSS NORTH DAKOTA LIKE PRAIRIE FIRE
YOU0000003114_S0000053 YOU FELLAS HAVE BEEN UP AGAINST THAT FOR MANY YEARS YOU'VE SEEN THE FELLAS PASSING THE MONEY DOWN THE LINE IN THE PAIL
YOU0000003114_S0000059 SO YOU HAD AN ORGANIZER WHO KNEW HOW TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF FARMERS
YOU0000003114_S0000067 AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE
YOU0000003114_S0000075 THE SECOND BILL CREATED THE INDUSTRY AS ITSELF CREATED THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA AND ALLOCATED FUNDS
YOU0000003114_S0000082 AND BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA WAS ON ITS WAY
YOU0000003114_S0000088 HERE'S THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA WHO'S GOING TO CREATE A STATE-OWNED BANK WHICH RUNS DIRECTLY IN THE FACE OF PRIVATE CAPITAL PRIVATE BANKING
YOU0000003114_S0000097 YOU WANT US TO BUY THE BONDS SO YOU CAN CUT OUR LENDING TO NORTH DAKOTA FARMERS
YOU0000003114_S0000103 EVEN WORSE
YOU0000003114_S0000111 THE NORTH DAKOTA BANKERS ASSOCIATION
YOU0000003114_S0000117 THAT HELPED THE OPPOSITION
YOU0000003114_S0000126 SO THE MINUTE THAT THE LEAGUE WAS TAINTED
YOU0000003114_S0000134 ATTORNEY GENERAL
YOU0000003114_S0000142 AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE IRONY OF THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA
YOU0000003114_S0000149 I HAVE A BANK AT MY DISPOSAL
YOU0000003114_S0000155 BUT THE FARM ECONOMY WAS COLLAPSING
YOU0000003114_S0000161 LENDING MONIES TO THE FARMERS
YOU0000003114_S0000175 DEAR SIR
YOU0000003114_S0000180 IT WOULD BE ALMOST HIS DEATH NOW TO BE TURNED AWAY WITH NOTHING
YOU0000003114_S0000189 BUT IT HAD TO OWN THEM TO PROTECT THE MORTGAGES
YOU0000003114_S0000199 HE WAS ACTING IN AN FDR WAY IF YOU'D LIKE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CRISIS IS SUCH THAT THIS CALLS FOR MEASURES THAT WE WOULD NOT NORMALLY USE AND IT AT THE SAME TIME GAVE PEOPLE SOME TIME HERE IN THE STATE TO GET THEIR FINANCIAL HOUSE IN ORDER
YOU0000003114_S0000208 STATE-OWNED INSTITUTIONS
YOU0000003114_S0000215 AND IT PROBABLY HAS PAID FOR THOSE SINS I WOULD SAY IT'S NOW
YOU0000003114_S0000222 THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A TIME WHEN THE BANK DRIFTED FROM THAT BUT I THINK IT'S THERE TODAY
YOU0000003114_S0000231 INVEST MONEY IN NORTH DAKOTA SO THAT THEY CAN GROW BUSINESSES AND FARMS AND BUILD HOMES AND GET AN EDUCATION
YOU0000003114_S0000250 I MEAN WE'VE GOT A LOT TO BE PROUD OF IN THIS STATE AND WE SHOULD BE
YOU0000003114_S0000259 WE'RE KIND OF AN INDEPENDENT LOT IN THIS STATE
YOU0000003122_S0000059 AND SO OUR JOB IS TO ACTUALLY HOLD GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE
YOU0000003122_S0000070 IS THAT EVEN WHEN WE DISAGREE ON THE APPROACH WE ACTUALLY NEED DIFFERENT APPROACHES
YOU0000003122_S0000079 DECIDED THAT HE WAS GOING TO STAY ON
YOU0000003122_S0000093 BULLYING IS A TERRIBLE PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITY
YOU0000003122_S0000112 COUNTRY RIGHT I MEAN YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE A SOUTH-ASIAN CEO RIGHT
YOU0000003122_S0000121 AND BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER
YOU0000003122_S0000134 AND EACH OF THOSE GROUPS WANTS TO SEE DATA ABOUT THEMSELVES
YOU0000003122_S0000160 WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS
YOU0000003122_S0000172 AND SHE ONCE SAID THAT BEING LABELED A MODEL MINORITY MAKES US INVISIBLE
YOU0000003122_S0000181 LOST HIS JOB IN SIX MONTHS
YOU0000003122_S0000186 LOSES THEIR JOB
YOU0000003122_S0000194 AND I'M GOING TO STAND BY THIS PERSON I'M GOING TO STAND BY ALLEN I'M GOING TO STAND BY OTHER EXECUTIVES IN THE COMPANY I'M GOING TO STAND BY COMMUNITY LEADERS
YOU0000003122_S0000206 SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING NEW TO THINK ABOUT BEING RACIALIZED IN FACT THAT'S BEEN REALLY OUR HISTORY FROM EXCLUDING US FROM COMING INTO THE COUNTRY AND THEN HOW WE'RE TREATED ONCE WE'RE IN THE COUNTRY OR EVEN CITIZENS
YOU0000003122_S0000218 SO AT THE HEALTH FORUM WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE DATA WHICH IF YOU JUST COLLAPSED EVERYBODY TOGETHER
YOU0000003122_S0000234 RIGHT SO IF YOU GO BACK TO THE BAMBOO CEILING IDEA FOR EXAMPLE
YOU0000003122_S0000250 IT'S WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK AS WELL SO I MEAN I JUST WANTED TO AT LEAST REFLECT THAT
YOU0000003122_S0000263 BUT ALSO FOR OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL
YOU0000003122_S0000271 BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND RIGHT THE POWERS THAT BE WHO WANT TO HOLD ASIANS BACK UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY LIMIT YOUR FAMILY FROM COMING
YOU0000003122_S0000277 AND THE REASON THEY DON'T WANT US TO GROW OUR NUMBERS IS AGAIN AS I SAID WHEN THERE'S MORE NUMBERS
YOU0000003122_S0000287 AND TURKEY CURRENTLY HOLDS THAT SEAT SEVENTY THREE MILLION TURKS IS ONLY TWENTY MILLION ASIAN-AMERICANS SO I DO THINK WE SHOULD BE BETTER ABOUT TELLING OUR STORY
YOU0000003122_S0000303 THEIR FRIENDS GOT PUT IN JAIL
YOU0000003122_S0000321 THE OTHER THING
YOU0000003122_S0000335 SO EVERYTHING WE DO IN THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT SPACE IS NONPARTISAN
YOU0000003122_S0000342 AND THEN WE'LL TRY TO MATCH THE LANGUAGES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR PHONE BANKING TO THAT POPULATION
YOU0000003122_S0000355 OR WE CAN SHOW THE ACTIVISM IN DIFFERENT WAYS ONLINE TO GET PEOPLE TO BE INVOLVED TO GET PEOPLE TO REGISTER TO VOTE
YOU0000003122_S0000370 THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS JUST EIGHTEEN MILLION RISING I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD OF THAT
YOU0000003122_S0000384 WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT SO IMAGINE WHAT YOU COULD DO
YOU0000003122_S0000403 FIFTY DOLLARS
YOU0000003122_S0000414 IT'S UNBELIEVABLE
YOU0000003122_S0000430 SO I THINK THAT THIS IDEA OF REALLY CULTIVATING PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT BEING LEADERS IS REALLY IMPORTANT
YOU0000003122_S0000446 A LOT OF POLITICIANS KISS BABIES
YOU0000003122_S0000456 I HAD SOME MATERIALS BACK THERE IN CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED
YOU0000003122_S0000473 THEN THAT'S ONE LESS VOTE AND THERE ARE PLACES WHERE RACES WERE DECIDED BECAUSE HUNDREDS A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE DIDN'T CAST THEIR BALLOTS RIGHT SO GETTING YOUR PARENTS TO VOTE OTHER PEOPLE IN COMMUNITY
YOU0000003122_S0000488 WAS VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY EYE-OPENING FOR ME PERSONALLY
YOU0000003122_S0000504 HI THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE MY NAME'S BRENDAN CHAN
YOU0000003122_S0000530 SO ALL OF THOSE INTERSECTIONAL AND CROSS-RACIAL WORK IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
YOU0000003122_S0000546 PIGEONHOLED AND PEGGED AS OUTSIDERS SO WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU SO I DO THINK THAT IF WE FIND THOSE INTERSECTIONS IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT EASIER TO FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT MAKE US UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT LATER
YOU0000003122_S0000555 AND I FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT WE PROTECT THOSE LEADERS THAT WE DEVELOP THEM THAT WE GIVE THEM AN EDUCATION ABOUT WHAT PUBLIC SERVICE IS AND I WOULD JUST SAY IN CLOSING TO ADD TO YOUR POINT
YOU0000003122_S0000568 SO MY MOVEMENT IS TO HAVE CIVIL DISCOURSE TO TRY TO FIND OUT HOW WE CAN FIND WAYS TO WORK TOGETHER
YOU0000003122_S0000589 WE'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATES AND SUPPORT THEM
YOU0000003134_S0000023 AND THE POLITICAL FALLOUT KEEPS GROWING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP
YOU0000003134_S0000028 THAT IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH SEVERAL CITIES AND TOWNS WHICH HAVE ORDERED MASKS BE WORN
YOU0000003134_S0000168 FOR PEOPLE WHO DO KNOW ABOUT IT AND ARE FILING THEIR TAXES THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW THAT FREE TAX PREPARATION EXISTS IN THE COMMUNITY SO IT'S A HUGE RELIEF TO THEM OFTEN WHEN I SAY WE CAN DO THIS RIGHT HERE IN THE OFFICE FOR YOU AND THEY SAY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHARGE ME
YOU0000003134_S0000175 UNLESS WE SHOW THAT WE REALLY CARE FOR PEOPLE
YOU0000003142_S0000005 AND THIS IS A SERIOUS ILLNESS
YOU0000003142_S0000021 THEN MANUAL DELINEATION IS EXACTLY NOT
YOU0000003142_S0000028 SO TYPICALLY NOT ONE IMAGE IS ACQUIRED BUT
YOU0000003142_S0000047 SO MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRASTS ARE POSSIBLE
YOU0000003142_S0000056 OR THE HEAD SO THAT YOU COVER THE ENTIRE BRAIN OR THE ENTIRE HEAD IN THIS CASE
YOU0000003142_S0000065 WE SEE THE IMAGE BELOW
YOU0000003142_S0000081 YOU READ ABOUT FOUR CLASSES
YOU0000003142_S0000088 SO WHAT DOES THE DATA LOOK LIKE
YOU0000003142_S0000109 IN THE IMAGE AS WELL AS THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PATHOLOGIES
YOU0000003142_S0000117 IN THIS CASE IT IS ISOTROPIC RESOLUTION
YOU0000003142_S0000139 CENTRED OVER A PIXEL
YOU0000003142_S0000152 AND YOU TRAIN IT WITH A CNN CORRESPONDENT TO A LOSS FUNCTION
YOU0000003142_S0000166 HERE FIVE CLASS OUTPUT
YOU0000003142_S0000189 OF COURSE THERE ARE FOUR SEQUENCES
YOU0000003142_S0000198 NECROTIC CORE
YOU0000003142_S0000211 ONCE AGAIN THE IDEA IS TO USE PATCHES OF SIZE THIRTY THREE BY THIRTY THREE
YOU0000003142_S0000225 AND ACTUALLY REMOVE THOSE OTHER GROUPS
YOU0000003142_S0000242 THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME
YOU0000003142_S0000263 SO IT IS GOOD TO EXPLOIT THAT CORRELATION
YOU0000003142_S0000294 SO THERE IS BLOCK AS YOU SEEN BEFORE SERIES OF CONVOLUTION LAYERS AND EACH PLAYER RECEIVES INPUT FROM ALL THE PREVIOUS LAYERS
YOU0000003142_S0000314 THE OTHER ARCHITECTURE THAT WE
YOU0000003142_S0000326 SO
YOU0000003142_S0000344 OF COURSE YOU HAVE FIVE CLASSES SO YOU HAVE FIVE CLASS
YOU0000003142_S0000373 SO A VARIATION OF THAT NOT
YOU0000003142_S0000385 NOW IF WE CONSIDER THE TUMOUR ITSELF
YOU0000003142_S0000416 SO
YOU0000003142_S0000438 SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR

YOU0000003242_S0000240 YOU ARE A CITIZEN OF POLAND BUT YOU ARE NOT POLISH OKAY SO YOU CAN MAYBE BECOME BY LAW A PART OF THE SOCIETY
YOU0000003242_S0000258 THIS IS MY FAVORITE ONE BECAUSE THIS IS POLISH REFUGEES DURING WORLD WAR TWO IN IRAN
YOU0000003242_S0000272 THIS ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE GENDER ISSUES DOWN THE DRAIN SO
YOU0000003242_S0000278 AND
YOU0000003242_S0000286 BUT DESPERATE PEOPLE DO DESPERATE THINGS AND MAKE JOURNEYS THAT DON'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IN A RATIONAL AND IRRATIONAL WORLD
YOU0000003242_S0000298 AND EVERYWHERE AROUND THE WORLD BORDERS ARE CLOSING
YOU0000003242_S0000305 WHO CANNOT ESCAPE
YOU0000003242_S0000310 BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAPPED INSIDE THEIR COUNTRIES ARE OFTEN MORE VULNERABLE
YOU0000003242_S0000318 SO NO GOVERNMENT IN THE WORLD WANTS PEOPLE TURNING UP UNANNOUNCED ON ITS BORDERS
YOU0000003242_S0000327 YOU KNOW WHEN I HOST MY FRIENDS FOR DINNER I INVITE THEM OVER
YOU0000003242_S0000336 BUT WHEN PEOPLE ARE DISPLACED WITHIN THE BORDERS OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY BY EXACTLY THE SAME FACTORS THAT CAUSE REFUGEE FLOWS
YOU0000003242_S0000344 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TODAY WHERE THOSE BOATS WILL HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAVELLING FOR DIFFERENT DIFFERENT REASONS
YOU0000003242_S0000349 WHO IS ALLOWED TO STAY
YOU0000003242_S0000356 MOST REFUGEES WOULD PREFER NOT TO LIVE IN CAMPS BECAUSE THEY'RE KIND OF ARTIFICIAL CONSTRUCTS
YOU0000003242_S0000362 THERE'S ALWAYS SOME KIND OF PRIMARY EDUCATION
YOU0000003242_S0000367 AND YET THE VISIBILITY OF REFUGEE CAMPS IS
YOU0000003242_S0000374 AND IT WAS EASY TO SEE REFUGEES WHEN YOU CAN GO TO A CAMP
YOU0000003242_S0000380 INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION IS FLEETING
YOU0000003242_S0000392 IS NOT A LEGAL DEFINITION THERE IS NO CONVENTION
YOU0000003242_S0000403 THERE'S NO SINGLE UN AGENCY CHARGED WITH DEALING WITH THEM
YOU0000003242_S0000412 EVEN IF THAT GOVERNMENT CAUSED THEIR DISPLACEMENT
YOU0000003242_S0000424 THE NUMBER OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS INCREASES
YOU0000003242_S0000430 THEY DON'T QUALIFY AS A REFUGEE THEY'RE NOT FLEEING PERSECUTION FOR ONE OF THE FIVE REASONS
YOU0000003242_S0000437 SO OUR LAWS HAVEN'T KEPT UP WITH THE REALITIES OF WHY PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO MOVE
YOU0000003242_S0000450 AND SHE SAID THERE'S NO WATER
YOU0000003242_S0000457 WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE COSTS OF REFUGEES
YOU0000003242_S0000463 SO EUPHEMISTICALLY CALLED INFORMAL SETTLEMENT
YOU0000003242_S0000472 THAT'S A LONG TIME TO BE IN LIMBO WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WILL I BE ABLE TO GO HOME IF SO WHEN
YOU0000003242_S0000481 TWENTY-TWO PERCENT OF REFUGEES
YOU0000003242_S0000493 BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE CREDENTIALS TO DO SO IN THE HOST COUNTRY
YOU0000003242_S0000498 IN TURKEY THEY'VE AGONIZED FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS DO WE TEACH THE REFUGEE KIDS IN ARABIC OR IN TURKISH
YOU0000003242_S0000507 THEY'RE TRAUMATIZED SO THEY'RE ACTING OUT AND THEY'RE CRYING AND THEY'RE BULLYING
YOU0000003242_S0000514 YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD TO GO INTO A SECOND GRADE CLASS
YOU0000003242_S0000528 AND I'M HERE WITH

YOU0000003242_S0000619 AND YOU CAN CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL QUALITY OF THE UNITED STATES AS IT WAS ENVISIONED WOULD NOT CHANGE AND WOULD NOT BE THREATENED BY THIS INFLUX OF PEOPLE
YOU0000003242_S0000634 INSTEAD THE CRITIQUES HAVE LARGELY BEEN WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S DATA TO SHOW THAT DACA RECIPIENTS HAVE PRODUCED A LOT RIGHT THEY GENERATE A LOT OF WEALTH SO IT IS IN OUR INTEREST TO ACTUALLY LET THEM STAY
YOU0000003242_S0000646 AND THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING AND ROCHELLE MENTIONED AN EXAMPLE EARLIER FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE HERE IN THE MORNING
YOU0000003242_S0000655 AND THEY MADE THIS DESIGNATION AND SAID ON THAT BASIS YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHIN THE UNITED STATES
YOU0000003242_S0000662 AND I THINK THAT SHOULD REMAIN AT THE BACK OF OUR MINDS IS WHERE WE'RE KIND OF GOING THROUGH THE REST OF THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT IS REALLY AT THE CORE OF ALL OF THESE IMMIGRATION DEBATES

YOU0000003266_S0000064 AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE WATCHING ON OUR TV SCREENS IS THE UNRAVELING OF THE OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY
YOU0000003266_S0000071 WE SHOULD HAVE SPOKEN OUT RIGHT AWAY WHEN THE GREEN REVOLUTION WAS UP AND STARTING
YOU0000003266_S0000077 BECAUSE WHAT THAT DOES WHEN WE EQUIVOCATE ON OUR VALUES
YOU0000003266_S0000085 HE WAS OUT MAKING A POLITICAL STATEMENT WHICH WAS PANNED BY THE MEDIA AROUND THE WORLD
YOU0000003266_S0000094 AS THEY LEARNED MORE FACTS ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU0000003266_S0000102 YOU KNOW USUALLY WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS WE PULL TOGETHER
YOU0000003266_S0000123 ALL OF OUR ALLIES
YOU0000003266_S0000130 WITH REGARD TO THE ABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES TO TAKE ACTION MILITARILY
YOU0000003266_S0000136 THEY HAVE TO TAKE THIS HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM GET IT FROM TWENTY PERCENT UP
YOU0000003266_S0000144 THEY'RE MOVING FASTER TOWARD A NUCLEAR WEAPON THEY'RE SPINNING THE CENTRIFUGES FASTER
YOU0000003266_S0000150 THEY ARE NOT CHANGING THEIR MIND
YOU0000003266_S0000161 HE SEES THE CURRENCY GOING INTO THE TANK
YOU0000003266_S0000179 THE AYATOLLAHS SEE THESE KINDS OF STATEMENTS AND THEY THINK
YOU0000003266_S0000192 WAR SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT
YOU0000003266_S0000199 THE PERCENTAGE OF UNEMPLOYED JUST FELL BELOW EIGHT PERCENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FORTY THREE MONTHS
YOU0000003266_S0000208 AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WHEN THAT AND WHEN THAT OCCURRED WHAT DID ROMNEY DO
YOU0000003266_S0000220 YOU KNOW WHAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN SCRANTON IS TODAY
YOU0000003266_S0000229 TWENTY-THREE MILLION AMERICANS ARE STRUGGLING FOR WORK TODAY
YOU0000003266_S0000234 GET AMERICA ENERGY-INDEPENDENT IN NORTH AMERICA BY THE END OF THE DECADE
YOU0000003266_S0000239 THEY KEEP MISQUOTING HIM BUT LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE MITT ROMNEY I KNOW
YOU0000003266_S0000245 AND HE HAS CONSISTENTLY
YOU0000003266_S0000253 WE WANT TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY IN THE MIDDLE CLASS
YOU0000003266_S0000263 COMMITMENT TO INDIVIDUALS
YOU0000003266_S0000269 TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE WORKING TODAY
YOU0000003266_S0000278 TO AT THE SAME TIME PUT A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT ON THE CREDIT CARD A TRILLION DOLLAR TAX CUT FOR A VERY WEALTHY I WAS THERE I VOTED AGAINST HIM I SAID NO WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT
YOU0000003266_S0000284 THAT UNEMPLOYMENT WOULD NEVER GET TO EIGHT PERCENT IT WENT UP ABOVE EIGHT PERCENT FOR FORTY THREE MONTHS THEY SAID THAT RIGHT NOW IF WE JUST PASS THIS STIMULUS THE ECONOMY WOULD GROW AT FOUR PERCENT
YOU0000003266_S0000296 LET'S TALK ABOUT MEDICARE AND ENTITLEMENTS BOTH MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY ARE GOING BROKE AND TAKING A LARGER SHARE OF THE BUDGET IN THE PROCESS
YOU0000003266_S0000305 WHERE SHE STARTED A SMALL BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE NEW SKILLS SHE GOT
YOU0000003266_S0000312 EVEN THEIR OWN CHIEF ACTUARY AT MEDICARE BACKS THIS UP
YOU0000003266_S0000320 WE'RE GOING TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING
YOU0000003266_S0000325 GUARANTEED COVERAGE OPTIONS THAT YOU CAN'T BE DENIED
YOU0000003266_S0000330 MORE COVERAGE FOR MIDDLE-INCOME PEOPLE AND TOTAL OUT-OF-POCKET COVERAGE FOR THE POOR AND THE SICK
YOU0000003266_S0000344 WHO YOU BELIEVE
YOU0000003266_S0000360 HERE'S THE PROBLEM
YOU0000003266_S0000371 A VOUCHER IS YOU GO TO YOUR MAILBOX GET A CHECK AND BUY SOMETHING NOBODY'S PROPOSING THAT
YOU0000003266_S0000376 PAINT YOUR OPPONENT AS SOMEONE PEOPLE SHOULD RUN FROM
YOU0000003266_S0000394 WHO WILL PAY MORE IN TAXES
YOU0000003266_S0000401 WILL GET AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX RELIEF IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS
YOU0000003266_S0000408 THEY'RE HOLDING HOSTAGE THE MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUT TO THE SUPER WEALTHY
YOU0000003266_S0000421 IF EVERYBODY WHO PAID INCOME TAXES LAST YEAR INCLUDING SUCCESSFUL SMALL BUSINESSES DOUBLED THEIR INCOME TAXES THIS YEAR
YOU0000003266_S0000426 WE'LL GET A FEW WEALTHY PEOPLE TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE
YOU0000003266_S0000433 THIS ONE TAX WOULD ACTUALLY TAX ABOUT FIFTY THREE PERCENT OF SMALL-BUSINESS INCOME
YOU0000003266_S0000439 DON'T RAISE TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS AND DON'T LOWER THE SHARE OF INCOME THAT IS BORNE BY THE HIGH-INCOME EARNERS
YOU0000003266_S0000453 START WITH THE WEALTHY
YOU0000003266_S0000474 THEY DO NOT NEED IT MARTHA
YOU0000003266_S0000492 THE MILITARY SAYS
YOU0000003266_S0000502 LOOK WHEN I THINK ABOUT AFGHANISTAN I THINK ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE JOB THAT OUR TROOPS HAVE DONE YOU'VE BEEN THERE MORE THAN THE TWO OF US COMBINED
YOU0000003266_S0000510 WE WOULD HAVE MORE LIKELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR COMMANDERS GENERAL PETRAEUS ADMIRAL MULLEN
YOU0000003266_S0000518 THE FACT IS WE WENT THERE FOR ONE REASON TO GET THOSE PEOPLE WHO KILLED AMERICANS
YOU0000003266_S0000523 AND IN FACT IN THE MEANTIME WHAT WE SAID WE WOULD DO WE WOULD HELP TRAIN THE AFGHAN MILITARY
YOU0000003266_S0000532 WE WILL NOT GO ON JOINT PATROLS WE WILL NOT TRAIN IN THE FIELD WE'LL ONLY TRAIN IN THE IN THE ARMY BASES THAT EXIST THERE
YOU0000003266_S0000538 WE'VE BEEN IN THIS WAR FOR OVER A DECADE
YOU0000003266_S0000546 I WANT I WANT HIM AND ALL OF OUR TROOPS TO COME HOME AS SOON AND SAFELY AS POSSIBLE
YOU0000003266_S0000554 WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING AS WE TURN ON OUR TELEVISION SCREENS THESE DAYS
YOU0000003266_S0000567 UNLESS YOU SET A TIMELINE
YOU0000003266_S0000574 I HAVE TALKED TO A LOT OF TROOPS I'VE TALKED TO SENIOR OFFICERS WHO WERE CONCERNED THAT THE SURGE TROOPS WERE PULLED OUT DURING THE FIGHTING SEASON
YOU0000003266_S0000583 BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE HERE
YOU0000003266_S0000591 AND SO WHEN ADMIRAL MULLEN AND GENERAL PETRAEUS CAME TO CONGRESS AND SAID
YOU0000003266_S0000596 WHO STILL HAVE THE SAME MISSION TO PROSECUTE COUNTERINSURGENCY
YOU0000003266_S0000605 THEY'RE STILL FIGHTING US THEY'RE STILL COMING OVER THE PASSES
YOU0000003266_S0000616 ONE-FIFTH THE POPULATION FIVE TIMES AS LARGE GEOGRAPHICALLY
YOU0000003266_S0000624 NOT AN AL-QAIDA-SPONSORED GOVERNMENT THAT FOLLOWS ON
YOU0000003266_S0000632 BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
YOU0000003266_S0000639 HILLARY CLINTON WENT TO RUSSIA TO TRY AND CONVINCE HIM NOT TO DO SO THEY THWARTED HER EFFORTS
YOU0000003266_S0000644 THE MAN HAS SLAUGHTERED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HIS OWN PEOPLE AND MORE FOREIGN FIGHTERS ARE SPILLING INTO THIS COUNTRY
YOU0000003266_S0000649 THE QATARIS THE SAUDIS
YOU0000003266_S0000654 AND MEANWHILE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND SYRIANS ARE DEAD
YOU0000003266_S0000661 THAT WAS THEIR IDEA WE'RE THE ONES THAT SAID ENOUGH WITH REGARD TO THE RESET NOT WORKING
YOU0000003266_S0000669 BUT WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE EARLIER IS WORK WITH THOSE FREEDOM FIGHTERS THOSE DISSIDENTS IN SYRIA
YOU0000003266_S0000679 BUT PUTTING AMERICAN TROOPS ON THE GROUND
YOU0000003266_S0000686 PLEASE TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAME TO THAT DECISION
YOU0000003266_S0000693 MY FAITH INFORMS ME ABOUT HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THE VULNERABLE
YOU0000003266_S0000698 THAT'S A FACTOR OF COURSE
YOU0000003266_S0000704 AND TO THIS DAY
YOU0000003266_S0000709 NOW I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE
YOU0000003266_S0000714 THEY'RE INFRINGING UPON OUR FIRST FREEDOM
YOU0000003266_S0000720 NOW THEY SUPPORT IT WITHOUT RESTRICTION AND WITH TAXPAYER FUNDING
YOU0000003266_S0000728 AND IT HAS PARTICULARLY INFORMED MY SOCIAL DOCTRINE
YOU0000003266_S0000746 WE DON'T THINK THAT UNELECTED JUDGES SHOULD MAKE THIS DECISION THAT PEOPLE THROUGH THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND REACHING A CONSENSUS IN SOCIETY THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS SHOULD MAKE THIS DETERMINATION
YOU0000003266_S0000754 THEY'VE BEEN GOOD JUSTICES
YOU0000003266_S0000761 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN
YOU0000003266_S0000766 I WOULD ALSO TELL HIM THAT THE FACT THAT
YOU0000003266_S0000776 SECOND OF ALL I'D SAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO IMPOSE THESE DEVASTATING CUTS ON OUR MILITARY WHICH COMPROMISES THEIR MISSION AND THEIR SAFETY
YOU0000003266_S0000781 IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD RECORD TO RUN ON
YOU0000003266_S0000788 TWELVE OF THEM HIT THE MIDDLE CLASS
YOU0000003266_S0000802 IT CUTS EDUCATION BY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS
YOU0000003266_S0000808 WHAT COULD YOU BOTH GIVE TO THIS COUNTRY AS A MAN AS A HUMAN BEING THAT NO ONE ELSE COULD
YOU0000003266_S0000815 WE CAN GROW THIS ECONOMY FASTER THAT'S WHAT OUR FIVE-POINT PLAN FOR A STRONGER MIDDLE CLASS IS ALL ABOUT IT'S ABOUT GETTING TWELVE MILLION JOBS
YOU0000003266_S0000823 AND MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE
YOU0000003266_S0000830 HAS VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN STARTING WITH A CLOSING WELL
YOU0000003266_S0000841 HE'S TALKING ABOUT HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BUILT THIS COUNTRY
YOU0000003266_S0000846 AND THE PRESIDENT AND I ARE NOT GOING TO REST UNTIL THAT PLAYING FIELD IS LEVELED
YOU0000003266_S0000851 THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT
YOU0000003266_S0000857 WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY ARE WE GOING TO GIVE OUR KIDS
YOU0000003266_S0000862 IT'S FAILED TO CREATE THE JOBS WE NEED TWENTY-THREE MILLION AMERICANS ARE STRUGGLING FOR WORK TODAY
YOU0000003266_S0000867 WE'RE OFFERING REAL REFORMS FOR A REAL RECOVERY FOR EVERY AMERICAN
YOU0000003266_S0000872 IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO GET THIS JOB DONE
YOU0000003266_S0000879 AND WE WILL NOT TRY TO REPLACE OUR FOUNDING PRINCIPLES WE WILL REAPPLY OUR FOUNDING PRINCIPLES
YOU0000003266_S0000885 HAVE A GOOD EVENING
YOU0000003274_S0000085 THE G A THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY EVERY NIGHT AT SEVEN
YOU0000003282_S0000015 THEY THINK THAT THIS IS I MEAN AND THEY'RE NO WRONG EITHER THE IT'S UM
YOU0000003282_S0000028 SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS NEXT
YOU0000003282_S0000052 WHEREAS THE LEFTISTS AT THIS POINT
YOU0000003282_S0000062 THEY'RE DESPERATE BUT B
YOU0000003282_S0000083 LET'S GET INTO AN ISSUE THAT OBVIOUSLY AFFECTS EVERYBODY WATCHING AND LISTENING TO THIS AND THAT'S CENSORSHIP BUT I DON'T EVEN CALL THIS CENSORSHIP THE DOCUMENTS WE'VE GOTTEN FROM GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK AND OTHERS IS ITS TOTAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
YOU0000003282_S0000110 AND THEY'RE ALREADY LINING UP WITH FACEBOOK GOOGLE ALL OF THEM AGREEING WITH CHINA
YOU0000003282_S0000130 YES HE'S VERY DEAF
YOU0000003282_S0000182 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A REALLY WILD FEW YEARS WELL YOU'VE GOT CHILDREN WHAT'S YOUR GUT LEVEL
YOU0000003293_S0000019 BY THE TIME OF AUGUSTUS THERE WERE PUBLIC LIBRARIES NEAR THE FORUMS OF ROME
YOU0000003293_S0000035 THESE LIBRARIES WERE DEVOTED SOLELY TO THE EDUCATION OF THE MONKS AND WERE SEEN AS ESSENTIAL TO THEIR SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT
YOU0000003293_S0000040 CONSTANTINE HIMSELF WANTED SUCH A LIBRARY BUT HIS SHORT RULE DENIED HIM THE ABILITY TO SEE HIS VISION TO FRUITION
YOU0000003293_S0000051 AS A THEOLOGICAL LIBRARY IT WAS KNOWN TO HAVE EMPLOYED A LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
YOU0000003293_S0000056 TEACHERS ALSO WERE KNOWN TO HAVE SMALL PERSONAL LIBRARIES AS WELL AS WEALTHY BIBLIOPHILES WHO COULD AFFORD THE HIGHLY ORNATE BOOKS OF THE PERIOD THUS IN THE SIXTH CENTURY AT THE CLOSE OF THE CLASSICAL PERIOD THE GREAT LIBRARIES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN WORLD REMAINED THOSE OF CONSTANTINOPLE AND ALEXANDRIA
YOU0000003293_S0000065 BY THE NINTH CENTURY PUBLIC LIBRARIES STARTED TO APPEAR IN MANY ISLAMIC CITIES
YOU0000003293_S0000082 IN EUROPEAN LIBRARIES BOOKCASES WERE ARRANGED PARALLEL TO AND AGAINST THE WALLS
YOU0000003293_S0000088 MALATESTA NOVELLO LORD OF CESENA FOUNDED THE MALATESTIANA LIBRARY
YOU0000003293_S0000098 IN ITS HEYDAY IT BOASTED A COLLECTION OF SEVENTY THOUSAND VOLUMES OF ANTIQUE BOOKS
YOU0000003293_S0000135 MANY INSTITUTIONS MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN A CIRCULATING OR LENDING LIBRARY WHERE MATERIALS ARE EXPECTED AND INTENDED TO BE LOANED TO PATRONS INSTITUTIONS OR OTHER LIBRARIES AND A REFERENCE LIBRARY WHERE MATERIAL IS NOT LENT OUT
YOU0000003293_S0000141 SOME ACADEMIC LIBRARIES ESPECIALLY THOSE AT PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN WHOLE OR IN PART
YOU0000003293_S0000159 A REFERENCE LIBRARY DOES NOT LEND BOOKS AND OTHER ITEMS INSTEAD THEY MUST BE READ AT THE LIBRARY ITSELF
YOU0000003293_S0000164 SUCH REFERENCE SECTIONS MAY BE REFERRED TO AS READING ROOMS
YOU0000003293_S0000170 A RESEARCH LIBRARY IS MOST OFTEN AN ACADEMIC OR NATIONAL LIBRARY BUT A LARGE SPECIAL LIBRARY MAY HAVE A RESEARCH LIBRARY WITHIN ITS SPECIAL FIELD AND A VERY FEW OF THE LARGEST PUBLIC LIBRARIES ALSO SERVE AS RESEARCH LIBRARIES
YOU0000003293_S0000200 ORIGINALLY LIBRARY ADVOCACY WAS CENTERED ON THE LIBRARY ITSELF BUT CURRENT TRENDS SHOW LIBRARIES POSITIONING THEMSELVES TO DEMONSTRATE THEY PROVIDE ECONOMIC VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY IN MEANS THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE CHECKING OUT OF BOOKS AND OTHER MEDIA
YOU0000003305_S0000007 WHICH HAS BEEN STOLEN BY HIJACKERS IN AN IN MASSIVE DATA BREACHES
YOU0000003313_S0000020 BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN MARRIED THAT LONG
YOU0000003323_S0000014 WE'VE ALREADY COVERED CLASS ACTIONS REGARDING INCREASED PRICES OVER DVD PLAYERS BECAUSE OF THE CHIPS THEMSELVES THAT WERE WERE RAISED IN PRICE BECAUSE THEY MADE SURE THAT THOSE PRICES WERE HIGHER
YOU0000003323_S0000024 THIS COULD POTENTIALLY HYPOTHETICALLY RESULT IN A SETTLEMENT
YOU0000003323_S0000031 ONCE THE CLASS IS CERTIFIED WE SEE ROUGHLY NINETY PERCENT OF THESE CASES SETTLE BEFORE THEY GO TO TRIAL
YOU0000003323_S0000043 THERE'S GOING TO BE A HECK OF A FIGHT
YOU0000003323_S0000048 WHEN YOU BUY ONE OF THOSE IT TYPICALLY SHOWS UP ON YOUR BILL IT SHOWS UP IN YOUR ACCOUNT YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH YOUR HISTORY AND SEE WHAT DEVICES YOU HAD AND WHEN YOU GOT THEM
YOU0000003323_S0000055 I DO QUALIFY CORRECT
YOU0000003323_S0000063 YOU'RE IMPACTED BY THE QUALCOMM ALLEGED PRICE FIXING CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT
YOU0000003331_S0000010 JOURNALISTS DON'T RUN AWAY FROM FALLING BUILDING WE DON'T RUN AWAY FROM THE FIRE WE RUN TO IT BECAUSE IT'S OUR JOB TO RECORD HISTORY
YOU0000003331_S0000019 I'VE NEVER REGRETTED TAKING THAT PHOTOGRAPH AT ALL
YOU0000003339_S0000010 THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRANSPARENCY
YOU0000003339_S0000017 THIS IS A STEP FOR DONALD TRUMP TO CONTINUE LAYING THE FRAMEWORK THAT HE'S BEEN LAYING FOR MONTHS NOW TO FIRE ROBERT MUELLER
YOU0000003339_S0000024 THEY ARE OBSESSED WITH THIS STEELE DOSSIER WHICH THEY CLAIM ERRONEOUSLY IS THE REASON THAT THIS FISA WARRANT AND THE INVESTIGATION EVEN STARTED
YOU0000003339_S0000029 THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT MIGHT BE PROVEN FALSE
YOU0000003339_S0000035 BACK TO THE MAIN ISSUE
YOU0000003339_S0000040 AND ONLY THE MOST CORRUPT AND DISGUSTING WANT TO SEE
YOU0000003339_S0000046 BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT
YOU0000003347_S0000016 HE GATHERED THEM TOGETHER AND HE DEFEATED THAT LEGISLATION SO WHERE DO DEMOCRATS FIT IN THIS TIME
YOU0000003347_S0000027 ALL OF A SUDDEN TRUMP IS ON THIS BANDWAGON
YOU0000003347_S0000042 AND SO THEY'RE SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY THAT THIS MARKUP THING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH R AND D
YOU0000003347_S0000055 THINGS THAT YOU WOULDN'T ALLOW INTO THE COURT OF LAW THAT WOULD BE STRUCK DOWN YOU'RE AN ATTORNEY YOU'D KNOW THIS LIKE YOU CAN'T ALLOW HEARSAY CONJECTURE AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE COURT OF LAW BUT YET THEY'RE PUTTING IT ALL INTO THIS DOCUMENT JUST TO JUSTIFY
YOU0000003347_S0000062 DRESSED UP LIKE CARMEN MIRANDA AND SHIRLEY TEMPLE AT NIGHT
YOU0000003347_S0000073 BUT AGAIN
YOU0000003347_S0000082 GO AFTER THE PROUD BOYS UP IN UP IN OREGON
YOU0000003347_S0000100 AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS OVER WITH WE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL OVER UNTIL NINE ELEVEN AND THEN IT STARTED REBUILDING NOW THIS IS JUST A CONTINUATION OF THAT TYPE OF SPY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE ALL KNOW IS THERE AND NOBODY WILL TALK ABOUT IT BUT IT IS THERE AND
YOU0000003355_S0000012 WHAT I DID SAY THAT NIGHT WAS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A SEXIST A RACIST AND A LIAR WHO WOULD WEAPONIZE WHATEVER HE COULD
YOU0000003355_S0000026 THE REAL ISSUE IS
YOU0000003355_S0000031 I WANT TO WATCH THAT ONE MORE TIME SORRY I WANT TO REPLAY THAT VIDEO CUZ IT'S IMPORTANT TO PLAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT HE SAID THERE
YOU0000003355_S0000036 OR ARE YOU ON THE SIDE OF BIG MONEY AND THE CORPORATIONS
YOU0000003355_S0000051 AND THERE ARE MANY WOMEN MAYORS BUT NOT ENOUGH
YOU0000003355_S0000075 BUT FOR ME
YOU0000003355_S0000081 OR THAT HE SAID YEAH TRUMP IS GONNA ATTACK
YOU0000003355_S0000099 WHICH IS ALREADY LIKE A LITTLE BIT SUSPECT BUT FINE
YOU0000003355_S0000105 AND IT REMINDS ME OF IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE STORY COMING OUT
YOU0000003355_S0000115 SO IF YOU SPEAK TO PEOPLE WHO HAD A CONVERSATION WITH WARREN MORE THAN A YEAR AGO AND YOU REACH OUT TO THESE TWO CAMPAIGNS
YOU0000003355_S0000123 THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE USING OR EXPLOITING SEXISM FOR THEIR POLITICAL GAIN
YOU0000003355_S0000132 BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH HIM

YOU0000003380_S0000079 THAT IS A TRAGEDY OF THE WORST PROPORTIONS
YOU0000003390_S0000010 HOWEVER THERE BASED ON THE MUELLER REPORT OBVIOUSLY HE CLAIMED THAT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CHARGE HIM WITH CONSPIRACY
YOU0000003390_S0000017 ACCORDING TO THE REPORT THERE WERE AT LEAST TEN INSTANCES THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
YOU0000003390_S0000025 HALF A CENTURY AGO

YOU0000003390_S0000037 AND YOU WROTE QUOTE
YOU0000003390_S0000045 SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE PRESIDENT'S EFFORT TO HAVE SESSIONS LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION TO FUTURE ELECTION INTERFERENCE WAS INTENDED TO PREVENT FURTHER INVESTIGATIVE SCRUTINY OF THE PRESIDENT'S AND HIS CAMPAIGN'S CONDUCT
YOU0000003390_S0000054 I THINK THAT HE WAS CONCISE HE HAD THE SPECIFIC EXCERPTS FROM THE ACTUAL REPORT THAT HE COULD REFERRED TO AND TO BE FAIR OTHER DEMOCRATS DID AS WELL

YOU0000003918_S0000105 EMBROIDERY
YOU0000003918_S0000112 BESIDES THE ELIZABETHAN CLOTHING THERE WAS ALSO FOREIGN INFLUENCE
YOU0000003918_S0000128 IT IS SAID THAT THE COSTUMES IN THE SHAKESPEAREAN THEATRE WERE PROBABLY OF MORE VALUE THAN THE THEATER BUILDING ITSELF
YOU0000003918_S0000135 OR THE NOBILITY THEMSELVES SOLD IT TO THE PLAYERS BECAUSE THEY FIGURED HEY THIS IS
YOU0000003918_S0000149 THIS AS FAR AS I KNOW IS THE ONLY PICTURE THAT WE HAVE OF A SHAKESPEAREAN PRODUCTION
YOU0000003918_S0000155 BUT IT'S A MIXTURE
YOU0000003918_S0000162 THEY ARE IN ELIZABETHAN DRESS
YOU0000003918_S0000171 SO THERE IS A MIXTURE WHICH THE AUDIENCE MAY HAVE JUST EMBRACED AS FINE
YOU0000003918_S0000177 WITH QUITE A BIT OF VISUAL SPLENDOR
YOU0000003918_S0000190 THIS IS FROM A REVIEWER FROM A PAPER CALLED THE SPECTATOR IN THIS TIME PERIOD
YOU0000003918_S0000196 AND AS FOR THE QUEEN
YOU0000003918_S0000204 SO CONTEMPORARY CLOTHING WAS OFTEN PROVIDED BY ACTORS AND HERE YOU SEE DAVID GARRICK VERY FAMOUS ACTOR AND COMPANY MANAGER
YOU0000003918_S0000214 ACTORS AT THE TIME
YOU0000003918_S0000222 SHE ALSO HAPPENED TO BE THE MISTRESS OF WILLIAM THE FOURTH WHO WAS THE ENGLISH KING BEFORE VICTORIA
YOU0000003918_S0000230 AND HER HAT IS ALBANIAN OR GREEK
YOU0000003918_S0000243 THE WHOLE OF THE DRESSES AND DECORATIONS BEING EXECUTED FROM INDISPUTABLE AUTHORITIES KING JOHN'S EFFIGY IN WORCESTER CATHEDRAL
YOU0000003918_S0000256 THERE WERE MANY ROLES THAT WERE SET AND MOVEMENT INTONATION AND CHARACTER WERE THE SAME AT EVERY PERFORMANCE
YOU0000003918_S0000262 AND THIS IS IT'S A BOOK OF RECITATIONS THAT YOU CAN DO AT HOME
YOU0000003918_S0000270 SHE FINALLY SHE TOURED THE UNITED STATES AND LONDON BECOMING WIDELY POPULAR
YOU0000003918_S0000276 AND SHE DESIGNED THEM SO THAT NOT ONLY DID THEY FIT HER BODY WELL BUT THEY FIT HER CHARACTER'S MOOD AND BY THE TIME BY THE END OF HER CAREER SHE HAD OVER SIXTY FIVE TRUNKS OF COSTUMES
YOU0000003918_S0000284 I PUT HER IN WHITE TOO
YOU0000003918_S0000292 SHE BOUGHT TWO ALLIGATORS
YOU0000003918_S0000305 I'LL SHOW YOU A FEW OTHER FAMOUS ACTRESSES OF THE TIME MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF SARAH BERNHARDT
YOU0000003918_S0000310 SHE ALSO AS YOU SEE PLAYED HAMLET AND MUCHA
YOU0000003918_S0000318 SO HERE SHE IS ON THE LEFT IN A PAINTING BY JOHN SINGER SARGENT
YOU0000003918_S0000329 NOW SHAW THOUGHT THAT HE WANTED TO LURE HER AWAY FROM IRVING TO ACT IN MODERN DRAMA
YOU0000003918_S0000337 USING AN OPEN STAGE A UNIFIED ACTING ENSEMBLE
YOU0000003918_S0000346 IT SHOULD HAVE A SENSE OF GRANDEUR AND BE BOLD AND DRAMATIC AND THAT THEATER WAS AN ART
YOU0000003918_S0000353 OR HISTORIC TO THE TIME PERIOD OF THAT CHARACTER
YOU0000003918_S0000358 SO SOME OF THE DESIGNERS TODAY ARE
YOU0000003918_S0000366 YOU HAVE ARTISTS WHO HAVE BEEN PAINTING
YOU0000003918_S0000375 HELEN MIRREN ON THE LEFT
YOU0000003918_S0000392 NOW THERE ARE THREE PRODUCTIONS THAT I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU FOR THE FINAL PART OF THIS TALK
YOU0000003918_S0000399 HARRY HOPKINS WHO IS THE ADVISOR TO FDR SAID
YOU0000003918_S0000410 AND THE THING THAT I THINK IS ALSO MOST EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS AN INTEGRATED THEATRE AND AT THAT TIME THAT WAS VERY UNUSUAL AND NOT EVEN PORGY AND BESS AT THE TIME WAS AN INTEGRATED THEATRE
YOU0000003918_S0000422 THERE WAS A LOT OF JOY AND ENERGY AND HE WANTED THE AUDIENCE'S IMAGINATION TO EVOKE THE SETTINGS OF THE FOREST AND THE COURT
YOU0000003918_S0000430 WE HAVE TRIED TO PRESENT THE PLACES AND THE CHARACTERS IN A VERY SIMPLE AND BASIC MANNER FOR THE PLAY TO COME TO LIFE THROUGH THE WORDS AND ACTING
YOU0000003918_S0000436 HOWEVER THERE WERE TWO REVIEWS THAT WERE A LITTLE KINDER
YOU0000003918_S0000442 WHICH SEEMS TO FIT THEM FOR A BACKGROUND TO SHAKESPEARE'S WILDEST PLAY
YOU0000003918_S0000447 I ENJOYED IT
YOU0000003918_S0000452 IT IS TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING FOR HALF AN HOUR OR SO AND THEN ITS APPEAL COLLAPSES
YOU0000003918_S0000460 I FORGOT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
YOU0000003918_S0000478 THE EARLY PART OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
YOU0000003918_S0000485 WE OFTEN DON'T THINK THINGS ARE WORTH ANYTHING UNTIL A HUNDRED YEARS LATER AND THEN WE GO
YOU0000003918_S0000510 A RECENT FILM THAT WAS DONE JACQUELINE DUREN WHO
YOU0000003918_S0000524 SO THEY WERE TRYING TO APPEAL TO A MODERN AUDIENCE THAT DIDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AND IT WAS MORE I THINK THAT PRODUCTION WAS MORE GOSSIP GIRLS MEETS MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS
YOU0000003918_S0000536 I THINK MODJESKA HOUSE HAS BITS BUT NOT A FULL COSTUME
YOU0000003926_S0000022 BUT IT'S REALLY WORKING FOR THESE COMPANIES
YOU0000003926_S0000036 AND NOT LIKE THE START UP KIND OF PROBLEMS YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE
YOU0000003926_S0000069 SO YOU CAN HEAR YOUR CLASSMATES' RESPONSES AND STUFF AS YOU GO THROUGH THE COURSE
YOU0000003926_S0000078 AND BECAUSE OF THAT
YOU0000003938_S0000007 WHILE LEBANESE SUNNI FIGHTERS ARE SUPPORTING THE REBELS
YOU0000003938_S0000027 NOW YOU TALK ABOUT THIS DIVIDE BETWEEN THE SUNNI MUSLIMS AND THE SHIITE
YOU0000003938_S0000037 OR MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF MILLION REFUGEES OUTSIDE
YOU0000003938_S0000048 YOU'RE WATCHING ON ASSIGNMENT
YOU0000003938_S0000063 NOW THE SECOND STORY THE SECOND LEAK THAT HAPPENED
YOU0000003938_S0000073 SO SAY IF I WERE IN BUCHAREST AND I WAS SENDING AN EMAIL TO SOMEBODY IN BURKINA FASO
YOU0000003938_S0000089 BUT
YOU0000003938_S0000097 BUT NOT EVERYONE IS HAPPY ABOUT THE PROJECT ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EFFECTS ON THE RIVER'S ECOSYSTEM AND VILLAGERS' LIVES
YOU0000003938_S0000106 THEY LIVE ALONG THE SESAN RIVER
YOU0000003938_S0000128 THE GOVERNMENT SAYS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WILL BE ADDRESSED
YOU0000003938_S0000142 CAR BOMBS AND SHOOTINGS MAKE DAGESTAN THE LEADER IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN RUSSIA'S TROUBLED NORTHERN CAUCASUS BUT AFTER DAGESTAN BECAME KNOWN AS THE HOME OF THE SUSPECTED BOSTON MARATHON BOMBERS
YOU0000003938_S0000148 LOOKING TO THE LONG TERM

YOU0000003938_S0000190 WHAT LED YOU TO THIS
YOU0000003938_S0000204 THAT'S AMAZING
YOU0000003946_S0000008 WAS ALSO A GOOD DAY FOR THE FISH BECAUSE THE THOUSANDS OF FISHERMEN WHO LINE THE SHORELINES ON SUNDAY WERE ALL AT HOME
YOU0000003946_S0000017 GOVERNMENTS WEREN'T AS STRONG THEN
YOU0000003946_S0000027 THEY SENT HIM TO CHINATOWN
YOU0000003946_S0000032 HE GOT WALL STREET
YOU0000003946_S0000041 RIGHT THERE ON THE ROOF WAS A DILAPIDATED SHACK
YOU0000003946_S0000047 GO AWAY HE SCREAMED I'M GIVING MY WIFE A CANCER TREATMENT
YOU0000003946_S0000055 A COMPARISON TO TURKEY
YOU0000003946_S0000070 WELL
YOU0000003946_S0000080 THEY ARE HEAVILY UNDERCOUNTED
YOU0000003946_S0000090 AND SO DEMOCRATS AND THEY GENERALLY VOTE DEMOCRAT AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN PUSHING
YOU0000003946_S0000100 ALL INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACIES WILL BE HOLDING A CENSUS IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND
YOU0000003946_S0000106 WHAT SHE HAD PROPOSED WAS A STATISTICAL WAY OF DEALING WITH THIS YOU KNOW THE GROUPS THAT YOU'VE MISSED
YOU0000003946_S0000117 BUT
YOU0000003946_S0000126 YOU KNOW ABOUT THE ONE CHILD POLICY AND THE GOVERNMENT IS STRONGLY TRYING TO PUSH THE BIRTHRATE DOWN
YOU0000003946_S0000133 AND IF YOU
YOU0000003946_S0000142 EVEN WHEN A COUNTRY TRIES
YOU0000003946_S0000150 AND YOU SEE IS THIS REASONABLE
YOU0000003946_S0000162 THE CENSUSES GET TOTALLY DISTORTED BY PEOPLE TRYING TO RAISE THEIR NUMBERS AND LOWER EVERYONE ELSE'S NUMBERS
YOU0000003946_S0000173 THE POINT OF THIS INITIAL PART POINT ONE
YOU0000003946_S0000185 LOOK AT ONE OF THESE
YOU0000003946_S0000194 PLUS FOR COMING IN OUT FOR GOING OUT
YOU0000003946_S0000212 THAT INCLUDES CHINA AND LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES EXCLUDING CHINA
YOU0000003946_S0000220 THEN YOU DO IT WITHOUT CHINA AND YOU GET
YOU0000003946_S0000228 SO CLOSE WHEREAS FOR THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IT'S TWELVE
YOU0000003946_S0000236 SAY TWENTY THREE TWENTY SIX EVEN THIRTY SIX FOR THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
YOU0000003946_S0000252 LOOK AT THE DEATH RATE
YOU0000003946_S0000259 TWENTY SIX BIRTHS
YOU0000003946_S0000271 YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD LOTS IN THE NEWS ABOUT DECLINING BIRTHRATES IN EUROPE AND JAPAN AND SO FORTH
YOU0000003946_S0000281 SO OUR POPULATION IS ALSO NOT ANYWHERE NEAR BALANCED
YOU0000003946_S0000290 A VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE
YOU0000003946_S0000302 FURTHER CHANGES IN THE DEATH RATE WILL HAVE SOME EFFECT BUT NOT AN ENORMOUS
YOU0000003946_S0000314 BUT LOOK WHAT HAPPENS IN THE DEATH RATE
YOU0000003946_S0000328 NOW
YOU0000003946_S0000339 HERE IS CENTRAL AMERICA THERE'S NOT A SINGLE COUNTRY THAT'S AS HIGH AS WE ARE
YOU0000003946_S0000354 AND IT'S A FUNNY THING ABOUT OLDER PEOPLE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO TEND TO DIE
YOU0000003946_S0000365 THE DEATH RATE IS COMPLETELY SENSITIVE TO YOUR AGE DISTRIBUTION
YOU0000003946_S0000374 MARRIAGE RATES
YOU0000003946_S0000390 WELL THERE'S SO MANY MALES AND SO MANY FEMALES
YOU0000003946_S0000405 THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN WHILE THE MEN WERE AWAY
YOU0000003946_S0000417 THIS IS INDIA
YOU0000003946_S0000423 THEY'RE INNUMERATE
YOU0000003946_S0000435 SEE THE BIG BARS HERE THE SMALL BARS HERE

YOU0000003946_S0000456 THE TOTAL AREA UNDER THIS SO THIS IS NOW FIVE-YEAR AGE HEAPS RATHER THAN SINGLE YEAR SO BETWEEN ZERO AND FOUR IS THIS AMOUNT OR THIS AMOUNT
YOU0000003946_S0000467 CLEARER EXAMPLE
YOU0000003946_S0000480 THE MAJOR EFFECT IS THAT EVERY GENERATION IS BIGGER AND THEY PRODUCE MORE AND MORE CHILDREN
YOU0000003946_S0000491 WHEN WOMEN THAT ARE FORTY TO FORTY FIVE WHICH HAVE NOT SO MUCH CHILDBEARING LEFT
YOU0000003946_S0000507 RIGHT
YOU0000003946_S0000520 THAT THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER OF BIRTHS WILL INCREASE AS A RESULT OF THESE TWO CROSSING FACTORS
YOU0000003946_S0000527 PREDICTED TO HAPPEN SO THIS IS AGAIN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND THIS IS THE KIND OF PYRAMID THAT WE'VE SEEN
YOU0000003946_S0000536 PEOPLE THAT THERE ARE THERE
YOU0000003946_S0000548 THE BASE WILL INCREASE
YOU0000003946_S0000558 AND WHEN POPULATION DECREASES YOU HAVE FEWER AND FEWER CHILD BEARERS IN EACH GENERATION AS SAY JAPAN NOW OR SINGAPORE
YOU0000003946_S0000573 WHAT IS ACTUALLY EXPECTED IS SOMEWHAT MORE SO HUGE AMOUNT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH POPULATION FUTURE IS ALREADY DETERMINED
YOU0000003946_S0000583 HERE IS
YOU0000003946_S0000593 PEOPLE LEARN WELL WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SO MANY CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DYING
YOU0000003946_S0000604 BUT LOOK AT HERE'S TOTAL POPULATION SIZE
YOU0000003946_S0000611 INCREASING
YOU0000003946_S0000621 SO
YOU0000003946_S0000636 AND
YOU0000003946_S0000646 THE POPULATION ALMOST DOUBLED FROM TWELVE MILLION TO TWENTY TWO MILLION
YOU0000003946_S0000658 AND AS GRASS ROOTS ORGANIZATIONS PUSH TO TRY TO GET THE BIRTHRATE DOWN

YOU0000003946_S0000687 AND THEY CAN NOW BE THEIR OWN COUNTRY
YOU0000003946_S0000693 THAT THEY HAVE WAR AFTER WAR AND HAVE TO SPEND HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON THE MILITARY THAT WOULD BE BETTER SPENT
YOU0000003946_S0000699 WHEN THEY GIVE UP ON MODERNIZATION THEY GLORIFY THE PAST THEY SAY IT WAS BETTER IN THE PAST
YOU0000003946_S0000713 IS BACKWARD LOOKING THAT THINGS WERE BETTER IN THE PAST MODERNIZATION HAS NOT WORKED
YOU0000003946_S0000723 THERE'S THESE HUGE NUMBERS OF UNEMPLOYED YOUNG MEN
YOU0000003954_S0000020 LEARNED CLEVER RESPECTABLE AND INDUSTRIOUS GIULIO DE' MEDICI'S REPUTATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES GREW AT A RAPID PACE UNUSUAL EVEN FOR THE RENAISSANCE
YOU0000003954_S0000038 THESE INCLUDED PROHIBITING PRIESTS FROM CARRYING ARMS FREQUENTING TAVERNS AND DANCING PROVOCATIVELY WHILE URGING THEM TO ATTEND WEEKLY CONFESSION
YOU0000003954_S0000058 MEANWHILE IN FLORENCE REPUBLICAN ENEMIES OF THE MEDICI TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE CHAOS TO AGAIN EXPEL THE POPE'S FAMILY FROM THE CITY
YOU0000003954_S0000068 HENRY NOW ARGUED THAT THIS HAD BEEN WRONG AND THAT HIS MARRIAGE HAD NEVER BEEN VALID
YOU0000003954_S0000076 LAWS MADE UNDER HENRY ALREADY DECLARED THAT BISHOPS WOULD BE CONSECRATED EVEN WITHOUT PAPAL APPROVAL
YOU0000003954_S0000081 THE PETER'S PENCE ACT OUTLAWED THE ANNUAL PAYMENT BY LANDOWNERS OF ONE PENNY TO THE POPE

YOU0000003962_S0000404 IT MAKES IT ALL THE MORE ESSENTIAL TO CALL THE MAN WHO SPOKE DIRECTLY WITH THE PRESIDENT
YOU0000003962_S0000428 REALLY THEIR GOAL SHOULD BE TO GIVE YOU ALL OF THE FACTS

YOU0000003962_S0000546 UNLESS THEY GET HELP IN THEIR REELECTION
YOU0000003962_S0000599 HE WAS REPEATING THE PRESIDENT'S OWN EXPLANATION RELATE DIRECTLY TO HIM
YOU0000003962_S0000618 THANK YOU MR MANAGER
YOU0000003962_S0000668 THIS CONCLUSION FOLLOWS THAT CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY TEXT AND STRUCTURE
YOU0000003962_S0000698 IN THE CASE OF SUCH A QUESTION ADDRESSED TO BOTH SIDES THEY WILL SPLIT THE FIVE MINUTES EQUALLY
YOU0000003962_S0000707 WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID RAISE WAS THIS NOTION OF BLANKET DEFIANCE
YOU0000003962_S0000714 IN ORDER TO ALLOW US TO PRESENT THE TRUTH TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
YOU0000003962_S0000719 IN FACT EVERY SINGLE COURT THAT HAS CONSIDERED ANY PRESIDENTIAL CLAIM OF ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY SUCH AS THE ONE ASSERTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE HAS REJECTED IT OUT OF HAND
YOU0000003962_S0000734 SO THEY HAD TO HAVE IT DONE BY CHRISTMAS
YOU0000003962_S0000749 FIFTEEN THOUSAND UKRAINIANS HAVE DIED
YOU0000003962_S0000756 THE AID ALTHOUGH IT DID ARRIVE
YOU0000003962_S0000765 THERE WAS HARM
YOU0000003962_S0000773 AS A MATTER OF LAW DOES IT MATTER IF THERE WAS A QUID PRO QUO
YOU0000003962_S0000782 I WILL WITHHOLD THE MONEY
YOU0000003962_S0000793 IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST
YOU0000003962_S0000804 EVERYBODY HAS MIXED MOTIVES
YOU0000003962_S0000828 IN EVERY CRIMINAL CASE
YOU0000003962_S0000842 I WANT YOU TO DO AN INVESTIGATION OF MITT ROMNEY
YOU0000003962_S0000851 FOR LEGITIMATE REASONS YOU MIGHT SAY TO A GOVERNOR OF A STATE HEY GOVERNOR OF A STATE
YOU0000003962_S0000868 MR CHIEF JUSTICE
YOU0000003962_S0000891 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE SAID THAT
YOU0000003962_S0000898 THE HOUSE MANAGERS WANT TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE AN AVENUE FOR GOING TO COURT
YOU0000003962_S0000918 THE TEXT MESSAGE
YOU0000003962_S0000940 THE PRESIDENT'S UNREPENTANT AND WE FEAR HE WILL DO IT AGAIN
YOU0000003962_S0000954 DID THE HOUSE FATHER TO SEEK TESTIMONY OR LITIGATE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE ISSUES DURING THE MONTHS DURING WHICH IT HELD UP THE IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES BEFORE SENDING THEM TO THE SENATE
YOU0000003962_S0000974 SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT
YOU0000003962_S0000988 DECISION COULD COME ANY DAY
YOU0000003962_S0001008 NINE MONTHS IS PRETTY FAST FOR LITIGATION IN THE COURTS
YOU0000003962_S0001023 BUT TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY
YOU0000003962_S0001037 YOU KNOW LET THE VOTERS DECIDE EVEN THOUGH THE OBJECT IS TO CORRUPT THAT VOTE OF THE PEOPLE
YOU0000003962_S0001058 THE SENATOR FROM OHIO
YOU0000003962_S0001065 BUT IN RELITIGATION NO ONE GOES TO TRIAL WITHOUT DOING DISCOVERY
YOU0000003962_S0001078 AND PREVENT THIS CHAMBER FROM GETTING ITS BUSINESS DONE
YOU0000003962_S0001099 AT THE TIME OF THE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT HE WAS PROPHETIC
YOU0000003962_S0001111 ISN'T IT TRUE THAT DEPOSITIONS OF THE THREE WITNESSES IN THE CLINTON TRIAL WERE COMPLETED IN ONLY ONE DAY EACH
YOU0000003962_S0001116 WHAT IS CLEAR
YOU0000003962_S0001123 RIGHT NOW
YOU0000003962_S0001129 WEST POINT GRADUATE
YOU0000003962_S0001135 SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT WITNESSES
YOU0000003962_S0001140 THIS IS A TRIAL
YOU0000003962_S0001145 THE SENATE IN ITS HISTORY HAS HAD FIFTEEN DIFFERENT IMPEACHMENT TRIALS
YOU0000003962_S0001152 THERE WERE WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED IN THE SENATE WHO HAD NOT TESTIFIED
YOU0000003962_S0001163 CHIEF JUSTICE I SENT THE QUESTION TO THE DESK
YOU0000003962_S0001189 POTENTIAL WITNESSES THAT THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE RAISED AGAIN AND AGAIN IS JOHN BOLTON
YOU0000003962_S0001203 COUNSEL
YOU0000003962_S0001223 NONE OF THAT SUGGEST A VALID LEGITIMATE POLICY OBJECTIVE
YOU0000003962_S0001251 TO TARGET THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENT IS WRONG AND CORRUPT
YOU0000003962_S0001285 THE SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN
YOU0000003962_S0001316 EVERY PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT INCLUDING THIS ONE HAS INCLUDED CONDUCT THAT VIOLATED THE LAW
YOU0000003962_S0001342 ARTICLE ONE
YOU0000003962_S0001393 COUNSEL A FEW MINUTES AGO
YOU0000003962_S0001435 MR CHIEF JUSTICE
YOU0000003962_S0001453 BE LITIGATED AND DECIDED BY THE PRESIDING OFFICER OR WOULD HE GO TO COURT
YOU0000003962_S0001475 THROUGH THAT MOTION
YOU0000003962_S0001513 THE ANSWER IS OF COURSE NOT
YOU0000003962_S0001547 ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
YOU0000003962_S0001570 AND FOR THERE TO BE A CONSTITUTIONAL IMPEACHMENT BASED ON MIXED MOTIVES WOULD PERMIT ALMOST ANY PRESIDENT TO BE IMPEACHED
YOU0000003962_S0001674 THE SENATORS ASKED THE FOLLOWING QUESTION
YOU0000003962_S0001725 THE IDEA THAT
YOU0000003962_S0001738 THE EVIDENCE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PRESENTED
YOU0000003962_S0001797 THANK YOU
YOU0000003962_S0001832 THE SENATOR'S QUESTION IS DIRECTED TO COUNSEL FOR THE PRESIDENT
YOU0000003962_S0001857 THANK YOU COUNSEL
YOU0000003962_S0001880 HE REFUSED
YOU0000003962_S0001901 WE HAVE A WHOLESALE REJECTION OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING
YOU0000003962_S0001914 MEMBERS OF THE SENATE
YOU0000003962_S0001957 I HAD MY SUSPICIONS
YOU0000003962_S0001986 YOU HAVE TO HIRE EMPLOYEES
YOU0000003962_S0002001 ONE THING HAD CHANGED
YOU0000003962_S0002022 WITNESSES TESTIFIED BEFORE THE HOUSE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CONSISTENTLY EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT UKRAINE WAS A CORRUPT COUNTRY
YOU0000003962_S0002072 THE ANSWER IS YES
YOU0000003962_S0002116 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
YOU0000003962_S0002152 DID ANYONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE OR OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE TELL ANYONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE THAT PUBLICATION OF THE BOLTON BOOK WOULD BE POLITICALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR THE PRESIDENT
YOU0000003962_S0002173 IT'S NOT JUST THAT WE VIEW THE PROTECTION OF WHISTLEBLOWERS AS IMPORTANT
YOU0000003962_S0002190 THE CONSPIRACY THEORY WHICH I THINK WAS OUTLINED EARLIER THAT THE WHISTLEBLOWER COLLUDED WITH THE INTEL COMMITTEE STAFF TO PATCH AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FICTION
YOU0000003962_S0002205 AND SO DO WE
YOU0000003962_S0002216 THAT TO ME DOES NOT SEEM A WORTHWHILE OBJECT FOR ANYONE
YOU0000003962_S0002227 WHAT ADVERSE INFERENCES SHOULD WE DRAW ABOUT THE MISSING TESTIMONY AND DOCUMENTS
YOU0000003962_S0002238 RENTS AGAINST THEM
YOU0000003962_S0002260 WITH RESPECT TO
YOU0000003962_S0002268 THINK YOU MR MANAGER
YOU0000003962_S0002290 ALL THE DOCUMENT SUBPOENAS WERE ISSUED WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION
YOU0000003962_S0002297 ARTICLE THREE COURTS DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THAT
YOU0000003962_S0002306 HAS ASSERTED THAT
YOU0000003962_S0002317 BUT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THAT
YOU0000003962_S0002332 MR CHIEF JUSTICE
YOU0000003962_S0002348 IT WAS NOT ASSERTED AS IT RELATES TO ANY OF THE SEVENTEEN WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED
YOU0000003962_S0002354 THE HOUSE NEEDED
YOU0000003962_S0002359 NOTHING
YOU0000003962_S0002365 DID FULLY VOTE
YOU0000003962_S0002371 AFTER THE HOUSE HAD VOTED
YOU0000003962_S0002377 THERE IS NO MENTION OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IN THE NOVEMBER EIGHT LETTER
YOU0000003962_S0002385 THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO CHEAT
YOU0000003962_S0002392 THAT INCLUDES MULVANEY THAT INCLUDES BOLTON
YOU0000003962_S0002400 THE QUESTION DIRECTED TO COUNSEL FOR THE PRESIDENT AND HOUSE MANAGERS
YOU0000003962_S0002406 IT APPEARS THAT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS APPLIED DIFFERENT STANDARDS DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE PRESIDENT IS A MEMBER OF THEIR PARTY
YOU0000003962_S0002413 THERE IS NO
YOU0000003962_S0002425 IT IS UP TO EACH SENATOR TO MAKE A JUDGMENT AND I THINK THERE IS MUCH TRUTH TO THAT
YOU0000003962_S0002445 IT HAS TO BE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT
YOU0000003962_S0002457 THAT PRIVILEGE CAN BE OVERCOME BY SHOWING THE EVIDENCE IS IMPORTANT AND UNAVAILABLE ELSEWHERE
YOU0000003962_S0002466 ON SATURDAY THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT FORMALLY INVOKED IT
YOU0000003962_S0002475 AND THEN PROVIDE A LOG OF DOCUMENTS IN DISPUTE OR PERMIT A PRIVATE REVIEW OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN CONTESTED
YOU0000003962_S0002482 EVERY COURT THAT HAS CONSIDERED THE MATTER
YOU0000003962_S0002489 IN AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
YOU0000003962_S0002499 CORRESPONDENCE WITH OUTSIDE PARTIES LIKE RUDOLPH GIULIANI
YOU0000003962_S0002507 SO YOU CAN SEEK THE TRUTH
YOU0000003962_S0002516 SENATORS
YOU0000003962_S0002528 AND THE TIMELINE SHOWS THAT
YOU0000003962_S0002534 UNTIL
YOU0000003962_S0002541 DEMOCRATIC LEADER IS RECOGNIZED
YOU0000003962_S0002548 CAN EITHER OF YOU NAME A SINGLE WITNESS OR DOCUMENT TO WHICH THE PRESIDENT WAS GIVEN ACCESS
YOU0000003962_S0002559 WERE NOT VALIDLY AUTHORIZED
YOU0000003962_S0002579 MR CHIEF JUSTICE AND SENATORS
YOU0000003962_S0002587 THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY UNDER THE RULES OF THE HOUSE
YOU0000003962_S0002594 THERE IS A DECISION RECENTLY MADE IN THE MCCANN CASE
YOU0000003962_S0002600 NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW
YOU0000003962_S0002607 NOT THE SENATE AND HOUSE
YOU0000003962_S0002616 THANK YOU
YOU0000003962_S0002640 MEANING THAT WHATEVER ISSUE PERCEIVED OR REAL
YOU0000003962_S0002656 OF COURSE
YOU0000003962_S0002669 THAT YOU COULD NOT IMPEACH FOR ABUSE OF POWER
YOU0000003962_S0002693 HOW TO RESPOND TO THE HOUSE MANAGER'S ALLEGATION THAT MR MULVANEY SUPPORTED THEIR CLAIMS IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE
YOU0000003962_S0002700 PRESS CONFERENCE AND THEN ONE
YOU0000003962_S0002708 LET ME BE CLEAR
YOU0000003962_S0002715 THERE WAS NEVER ANY CONDITION ON THE FLOW OF THE AID RELATED TO THE MATTER OF THE DNC SERVER
YOU0000003962_S0002727 REFERENCED THE STATEMENT AFTER THE PRESS CONFERENCE THE HOUSE MANAGERS AGAIN CAME BACK AND SAID MR MULVANEY INDICATED OR ADMITTED THERE WAS A QUID PRO QUO
YOU0000003962_S0002749 BOLTON
YOU0000003962_S0002760 IT INVOLVE NOT JUST THE MEETING BUT INVOLVE THE MILITARY AID
YOU0000003962_S0002776 THE SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA
YOU0000003962_S0002789 THAT THE AID WAS RELEASED
YOU0000003962_S0002803 DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO RUSSIA DISSEMINATING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OR RUDOLPH GIULIANI'S CONSPIRACY THEORIES
YOU0000003962_S0002809 AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO READ IT
YOU0000003962_S0002822 THE DIRECTOR SAYS THAT THIS IS THE DIRECTOR'S DECISION BUT NONETHELESS THERE WAS A BODY OF INTELLIGENCE THAT IS RELEVANT TO REQUEST THAT WE HAVE MADE
YOU0000003962_S0002835 QUESTION IS DIRECTED TO COUNSEL FOR THE PRESIDENT
YOU0000003962_S0002846 CORRUPTION
YOU0000003962_S0002854 BY THE WAY THE CONGRESSMAN WAS JUST COMPLETELY WRONG WHEN HE SAID I'M THE ONLY SCHOLAR WHO SUPPORTS THIS POSITION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
YOU0000003962_S0002863 IF IN FACT PRESIDENT OBAMA OR PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON HAD BEEN IMPEACHED THE WEIGHT OF CURRENT SCHOLARSHIP WOULD BE CLEARLY IN FAVOR OF MY POSITION
YOU0000003962_S0002873 CAN BE CHARGED WHILE SITTING IN OFFICE THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF SCHOLARSHIP THAT SHOULD INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION
YOU0000003962_S0002880 BECAUSE THE FRAMERS HAD TO STRIKE A BALANCE HERE ARE THE REASONS WE NEED IMPEACHMENT YES
YOU0000003962_S0002889 DO NOT REJECT MY ARGUMENT THAT ABUSE OF POWER WOULD DESTROY
YOU0000003962_S0002903 THEMSELVES EVERY YEAR
YOU0000003962_S0002917 I DON'T THINK YOU CAN WRITE OFF THE CONSENSUS OF CONSTITUTIONAL OPINION BY SAYING THEY ARE ALL NEVER TRUMPER'S
YOU0000003962_S0002933 WOULD HAVE TERRIFIED THE FOUNDERS
YOU0000003962_S0002950 YOU ARE WATCHING LIVE COVERAGE FROM THE WASHINGTON POST OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
YOU0000003962_S0002984 THAN THE LONG THIRTY FORTY NINETY MINUTE SPEECHES THAT YOU HAD THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATIONS
YOU0000003962_S0003026 BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS REALLY INTERESTING SO FAR
YOU0000003962_S0003094 HERE'S HOW PHILBIN RESPONDED
YOU0000003962_S0003148 BATTLING CORRUPTION
YOU0000003962_S0003216 THE ANSWER IS YES
YOU0000003962_S0003252 THE TRIAL
YOU0000003962_S0003263 THE PRESIDENT NEVER RAISED THE QUESTION OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE
YOU0000003962_S0003270 NOT PRODUCE A SINGLE SHRED OF INFORMATION
YOU0000003962_S0003275 THERE HAS BEEN NO CASE LAW CITED TO JUSTIFY THE DOCTRINE OF ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY
YOU0000003962_S0003316 AND SCHOLARS HAVE POINTED OUT THOSE RULES APPLY EQUALLY IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT
YOU0000003962_S0003331 THANK YOU
YOU0000003962_S0003342 BY THE STANDARD THE PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL HAS APPLIED TO HUNTER BIDEN SHOULD MR KUSHNER AND MR TRUMP CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ALSO COME UNDER INVESTIGATION
YOU0000003962_S0003356 THE REASON WHY WE ARE HERE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYBODY'S CHILDREN
YOU0000003962_S0003367 THANK YOU
YOU0000003962_S0003377 MR CHIEF JUSTICE SENATORS THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION
YOU0000003962_S0003383 BECAME THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S POINT MAN FOR POLICY ON UKRAINE
YOU0000003962_S0003397 WHEN MR BIDEN'S SON WAS APPOINTED TO THE BOARD OF THIS COMPANY
YOU0000003962_S0003417 THANK YOU
YOU0000003962_S0003427 IN SHORT
YOU0000003962_S0003439 THERE ARE SPECIFIC FORMAL PROCESSES THAT HE SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED
YOU0000003962_S0003453 THIS WAS SOLELY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT HE COULD DO WHATEVER IT TOOK TO MAKE SURE THAT HE COULD WIND
YOU0000003962_S0003468 COUPLE OF DAYS AGO I READ TO YOU A QUOTE AND STATEMENT FROM VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN DEALING WITH CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE
YOU0000003962_S0003474 CORRUPTION SIPHONS AWAY RESOURCES FROM THE PEOPLE
YOU0000003962_S0003485 THE HOUSE MANAGERS DON'T DENY THAT THERE'S A LEGITIMATE REASON TO DO AN INVESTIGATION
YOU0000003962_S0003494 THE SUBJECT IS UKRAINE
YOU0000003962_S0003500 IN ONE MONTH ALONE
YOU0000003962_S0003509 HOW CAN YOU TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IT DOESN'T MERIT INQUIRY WHEN OUR VICE PRESIDENT'S SON IS SUPPOSEDLY DOING THIS FOR CORPORATE TRANSPARENCY IN UKRAINE
YOU0000003962_S0003521 I DO REMEMBER SEEING THE BANK RECORDS
YOU0000003962_S0003543 TO THE COUNSEL FOR THE PRESIDENT
YOU0000003962_S0003550 BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVENTEEN WITNESSES
YOU0000003962_S0003557 I WANT HUNTER BIDEN
YOU0000003962_S0003571 THEY PUT THIS FORWARD IN AN AGGRESSIVE AND FAST-PACED WAY
YOU0000003962_S0003581 THE QUESTION IS FROM SENATOR MENENDEZ TO THE HOUSE MANAGERS
YOU0000003962_S0003601 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
YOU0000003962_S0003613 BECAUSE NOTHING HAS CHANGED
YOU0000003962_S0003623 WHETHER THIS BODY SUBPOENAS THEM OR NOT
YOU0000003962_S0003636 OR WITNESSES
YOU0000003962_S0003651 SO
YOU0000003962_S0003673 I THINK WE CAN ALL SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
YOU0000003962_S0003682 SHOULDN'T HOUSE HAVE KNOWN
YOU0000003962_S0003707 BUT
YOU0000003962_S0003719 YOU CANNOT HAVE A FAIR TRIAL
YOU0000003962_S0003735 IMPEACHMENT TO TURN INTO
YOU0000003962_S0003748 AS PART OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CORRUPT EFFORT
YOU0000003962_S0003757 GIVING TO US
YOU0000003962_S0003763 HE WILL SPARE NO EFFORT
YOU0000003962_S0003770 NOT THE UKRAINIANS
YOU0000003962_S0003784 GIVEN THE MEDIA HAS DOCUMENTED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S THOUSANDS OF LIVES WHILE IN OFFICE
YOU0000003962_S0003808 IF IT HELPS HIS REELECTION IT'S GOOD FOR AMERICA
YOU0000003962_S0003817 WALK AWAY FROM THIS PRESIDENT
YOU0000003962_S0003839 BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY
YOU0000003962_S0003855 THE
YOU0000003962_S0003878 TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY FOR THE FUTURE
YOU0000003962_S0003911 ACTUALLY WE THINK THERE IS BRIBERY GOING ON HERE
YOU0000003962_S0004014 MR CHIEF JUSTICE
YOU0000003962_S0004105 THANK YOU
YOU0000003962_S0004299 MR CHIEF JUSTICE
YOU0000003962_S0004322 THE SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN
YOU0000003962_S0004345 WHAT DID YOU GET
YOU0000003962_S0004358 TO HEAR FROM A WITNESS WHO DIRECTLY SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT
YOU0000003962_S0004380 I YIELD BACK
YOU0000003962_S0004421 FROM A FOREIGN SOURCE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD VIOLATE CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW
YOU0000003962_S0004443 TO GET HELP IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
YOU0000003962_S0004463 THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING AS
YOU0000003962_S0004479 THAT'S WHAT I CALL CORRUPTION
YOU0000003962_S0004494 BY PRESSURING UKRAINE
YOU0000003962_S0004521 WITHHELD IT
YOU0000003962_S0004536 IF THAT WERE THE CASE
YOU0000003962_S0004559 NONE OF WHICH HAPPENED HERE
YOU0000003962_S0004584 WAS A TERRIFYING MOMENT
YOU0000003962_S0004606 JOHNSON'S CASE WAS A PERFECT EXAMPLE

YOU0000003962_S0004640 WILL SAY VERY CLEARLY
YOU0000003962_S0004647 AND THEN WE WILL PROCEED IN THIS WAY
YOU0000003962_S0004658 FOR EXPEDIENCY
YOU0000003962_S0004680 IT WOULD POSE EXISTENTIAL DANGERS TO OUR ABILITY TO LIVE TOGETHER
YOU0000003962_S0004697 THE SENATOR FROM ARIZONA
YOU0000003962_S0004756 ABOUT WHETHER TO IMPEACH AND REMOVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THAT WE STAY FOCUSED
YOU0000003970_S0000008 INTO SCULPTURES
YOU0000003970_S0000015 IT'S OPENING ITS DOORS AND IT'S LETTING PEOPLE IN
YOU0000003970_S0000027 THE COLLAPSE OF VENEZUELA DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE OF A CIVIL WAR OR A NATURAL DISASTER BUT RATHER THE COLOSSAL ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT BY THE COUNTRY'S LEADER NICOLAS MADURO
YOU0000003970_S0000037 THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND POLITICIANS CONTINUE TO LET THESE MIGRANTS IN
YOU0000003970_S0000055 YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PAST
YOU0000003970_S0000070 EARLIER THIS YEAR THE POLICE CHIEF IN THIS BORDER TOWN TOLD PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T RENT THEIR PROPERTIES TO VENEZUELANS AFTER A MIGRANT WAS ARRESTED FOR A HOMICIDE

YOU0000003978_S0000366 AFTER HER VENEREAL SUDDEN DEATH
YOU0000003978_S0000371 THE GEORGIAN'S DEATH THROUGH SEX AND BLUMENBACH'S LINKING OF CAUCASIANS WITH BEAUTY BELONGS TO A LONGER TRADITION

YOU0000003978_S0000383 NICE LOOKING PEOPLE
YOU0000003978_S0000394 ALL THE TRAVELERS
YOU0000003978_S0000400 IT WAS CHARDIN'S DESCRIPTION OF BEAUTIFUL GEORGIANS THAT BLUMENBACH QUOTED IN HIS BOOK AS PROOF THAT CIRCASSIAN BEAUTY OR GEORGIAN BEAUTY WAS AGREED UPON BY SCIENTISTS
YOU0000003978_S0000410 JOSEPH STALIN

YOU0000003978_S0000461 AND THE NEIGHBORING TRIBES BETWEEN THEM AND THE CAUCASUS
YOU0000003978_S0000468 PEOPLE WERE NOT MENTIONED
YOU0000003978_S0000475 CHARDIN WAS ACTUALLY ON A VOYAGE TO INDIA TO BUY JEWELRY

YOU0000003978_S0000511 SO YOU CAN DO WITH HER AS YOU WILL
YOU0000003978_S0000517 AMERICANS SELDOM ASSOCIATE THE WORD ODALISQUE WITH SLAVERY IN THE AMERICAS AND PARENTHETICALLY
YOU0000003978_S0000523 USUALLY UNCLOTHED
YOU0000003978_S0000532 CAUCASIANS HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE ETHNIC CLEANSING THEY SUFFERED IN THEIR ONE HUNDRED YEARS WAR AGAINST RUSSIANS
YOU0000003978_S0000550 GEORGIA AND RUSSIA PLAYED A PART IN US POLICY DISCUSSIONS
YOU0000003978_S0000556 NOT ON ANY BASIS IN BIOLOGICAL FACT
YOU0000003978_S0000561 JORG VON ASCH
YOU0000003978_S0000566 AND ONE ROOT LIES IN THE IDEA AND THE IDEAL OF ENSLAVED WOMEN AS ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL
YOU0000003978_S0000572 EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE OF EUROPEAN DESCENT
YOU0000003978_S0000577 THE TERM WILL NO LONGER BE RECOGNIZED
YOU0000003978_S0000583 ANOTHER SENSATIONAL GEORGIAN SKULL
YOU0000003978_S0000588 USUALLY SKULLS ARE FOUND ALONE
YOU0000003978_S0000594 THE SKULLS OF GIRLFRIENDS OR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT
YOU0000003978_S0000599 EVEN THOUGH SKULL FIVE AND EACH OF THE OTHER SKULLS LOOK DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER
YOU0000003978_S0000604 NOT SPECIES
YOU0000003978_S0000610 ANTHROPOLOGISTS FINALLY REALIZED THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL IS SINGULAR
YOU0000003986_S0000020 WHILE THE OTTOMAN GOVERNMENT TRIED TO IMPLEMENT THIS CHANGE IN POLICY IT WASN'T SUCCESSFUL AND ATTACKS EVEN MURDERS CONTINUED TO OCCUR UNPUNISHED BY LOCAL OFFICIALS IN THE PROVINCES DESPITE REPEATED INSTRUCTIONS IN CABLES SENT FROM THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION
YOU0000003986_S0000033 THE OPERATION INCLUDED DEATH MARCHES LOOTING TORTURE AND MASSACRE AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION
YOU0000003986_S0000040 THIS IS SUPPOSEDLY DONE IN ORDER TO MUCH EASIER BE ABLE TO CONFISCATE THE PROPERTY OF THE DEPORTED
YOU0000003986_S0000076 THAT TREATY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A DECLARATION OF AMNESTY
YOU0000003986_S0000095 BECAUSE OF CULTURAL AND POLITICAL TIES OF THE OTTOMAN GREEKS WITH EUROPEAN POWERS MIDLARSKY ARGUES GENOCIDE WAS NOT A VIABLE OPTION FOR THE OTTOMANS IN THEIR CASE
YOU0000003986_S0000106 HOWEVER THE NON-PARLIAMENTARY LEFT-WING NATIONALIST INTELLECTUAL AND AUTHOR GEORGE KARABELIAS BITTERLY CRITICIZED ELEFANTIS AND OTHERS OPPOSING THE RECOGNITION OF GENOCIDE AND CALLED THEM REVISIONIST HISTORIANS
YOU0000003986_S0000118 THE SECOND WORLD WAR THE CIVIL WAR THE MILITARY JUNTA AND THE POLITICAL TURMOIL IN GREECE THAT FOLLOWED FORCED GREECE TO FOCUS ON ITS SURVIVAL AND OTHER PROBLEMS RATHER THAN SEEK RECOGNITION OF THESE EVENTS
YOU0000003986_S0000145 SHAW STANFORD J SHAW EZEL KURAL HISTORY OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE AND MODERN TURKEY CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY
YOU0000003986_S0000162 THE GREEK RELIEF COMMITTEE AMERICA'S RESPONSE TO THE GREEK GENOCIDE
YOU0000003986_S0000178 THE PONTUS INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT AND THE GREEK GENOCIDE
YOU0000003994_S0000014 HOWEVER THE AFGHAN ARMY SUSPECTED AMANULLAH'S COMPLICITY IN THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER
YOU0000003994_S0000024 IN REALITY THE AFGHAN REGULAR ARMY WAS NOT READY FOR WAR
YOU0000003994_S0000030 FEW INFANTRY UNITS HAD BAYONETS
YOU0000003994_S0000036 THERE WAS NO ORGANISED TRANSPORT AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR SUPPLY WERE RUDIMENTARY
YOU0000003994_S0000045 HOWEVER MOST BATTERIES HAD ONLY FOUR GUNS
YOU0000003994_S0000051 LIKE OTHER UNITS OF THE BRITISH ARMY MANY OF THE TROOPS CONSIDERED THE WAR OVER AND LOOKED FORWARD TO BEING DEMOBILISED
YOU0000003994_S0000062 AGAINST THIS THE BRITISH AT THAL UNDER BRIGADIER GENERAL ALEXANDER EUSTACE POSSESSED ONLY FOUR BATTALIONS
YOU0000003994_S0000070 HE POSSESSED NO REGULAR BRITISH INFANTRY AND HIS FOUR BATTALIONS WERE ALL INEXPERIENCED INDIAN UNITS CONSISTING MAINLY OF YOUNG RECRUITS
YOU0000003994_S0000084 THE ABILITY OF THE BRITISH TO PROJECT AIRPOWER EVEN SMALL SCALE RAIDS HAD CONSIDERABLE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS
YOU0000003994_S0000095 OSTENSIBLY THE RESULT OF THE CONFLICT WAS A BRITISH TACTICAL VICTORY
YOU0000003994_S0000101 AS A RESULT OF THE PEACE TREATY THAT WAS NEGOTIATED THE BRITISH CEASED PAYMENT OF THE AFGHAN SUBSIDY AND THUS ENDED THEIR CLAIM TO DIRECT AFGHAN FOREIGN POLICY WHICH HAD BEEN THE PRO QUID QUO OF THE EMIR ACCEPTING THE SUBSIDY
YOU0000003994_S0000107 BUT AS BRITISH INFLUENCE DECLINED THE AFGHANS WERE ABLE TO GAIN CONTROL OF THEIR OWN FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND IN THE AFTERMATH EMERGED AS A FULLY INDEPENDENT STATE
YOU0000003994_S0000115 NO OTHER BATTLE HONOURS FOR INDIVIDUAL ENGAGEMENTS WERE ISSUED
YOU0000004002_S0000088 THIS MORNING WILL HEAR FROM GORDON SONDLAND THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO THE EUROPEAN UNION

YOU0000004002_S0000506 OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE A PUBLIC STATEMENT FROM THE UKRAINIANS THAT WOULD SATISFY PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CONCERNS
YOU0000004002_S0000514 WHICH IS THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN UKRAINE
YOU0000004002_S0000521 THERE WAS NO SECRET REGARDING MOVING FORWARD AND THE DISCUSSION OF INVESTIGATION
YOU0000004002_S0000532 VOLKER RESPONDED
YOU0000004002_S0000545 WAS DIRECTING KURT VOLKER TO SPEAK WITH MR GIULIANI
YOU0000004002_S0000554 I FIRST READ THE TRANSCRIPT ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIFTH
YOU0000004002_S0000559 VERY ODD THAT NEITHER I
YOU0000004002_S0000566 NOR DID HE DISCUSS ANY REQUEST TO INVESTIGATE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN
YOU0000004002_S0000572 THE CALL LASTED FIVE MINUTES

YOU0000004002_S0000652 IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY CREDIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE HOLD I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE AID LIKE THE WHITE HOUSE VISIT WAS JEOPARDIZED
YOU0000004002_S0000665 THEN THE HOLD ON MILITARY AID WILL BE LIFTED
YOU0000004002_S0000673 BASED ON MY PREVIOUS COMMUNICATION WITH SECRETARY POMPEO

YOU0000004002_S0002867 AND WE KNEW THAT THESE INVESTIGATIONS WERE IMPORTANT TO THE PRESIDENT
YOU0000004002_S0002873 I SHARED CONCERNS OF THE POTENTIAL QUID PRO QUO REGARDING THE SECURITY AID WITH SENATOR RON JOHNSON
YOU0000004002_S0002883 YOU SAID I RECALL MENTIONING THE PREREQUISITE OF INVESTIGATIONS BEFORE ANY WHITE HOUSE CALL OR MEETING

YOU0000004002_S0002961 HE MAKES IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR
YOU0000004002_S0002971 WHAT ARE WE PREPARED TO DO ABOUT IT
YOU0000004002_S0002977 GET OVER IT OR GET USED TO IT
YOU0000004002_S0002985 FOR OVER A YEAR I RESISTED THIS WHOLE IDEA OF GOING DOWN THE ROAD TO IMPEACHMENT
YOU0000004002_S0002993 GETTING CAUGHT IS NO DEFENSE
YOU0000004002_S0003003 SECOND
YOU0000004002_S0003071 WITH NATO
YOU0000004002_S0003120 WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO DISCUSS A FEW OF THE PEOPLE WHOSE TESTIMONY HAS BEEN DEEMED UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO HEAR
YOU0000004002_S0003128 USING IT AS THE CENTERPIECE OF THEIR IMPEACHMENT CRUSADE
YOU0000004002_S0003151 THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TRIED OTHER PETTY TRICKS TO SHAPE PUBLIC OPINION
YOU0000004002_S0003181 WITH THAT
YOU0000004002_S0003192 NOT TO ANY POLITICAL PARTY
YOU0000004002_S0003204 IN MY CURRENT ROLE I WORKED TO ADVANCE U S NATIONAL SECURITY WITH A FOCUS ON DETERRING RUSSIAN AGGRESSION AND BUILDING STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE FRONT-LINE STATES OF UKRAINE AND GEORGIA AS WELL AS TEN OTHER ALLIES AND PARTNERS FROM THE BALKANS TO THE CAUCUSES

YOU0000004002_S0003784 MS COOPER YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY DESTROYS TWO OF THE PILLARS OF THE PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE AND ONE JUSTIFICATION FOR HIS CONDUCT
YOU0000004002_S0003790 GOING TO GO THROUGH YOUR NEW TESTIMONY TODAY
YOU0000004002_S0003819 WERE ARMORED HUMVEES
YOU0000004002_S0003827 THE AIDE THAT WAS WITHHELD TO LEBANON AND PAKISTAN
YOU0000004002_S0003835 YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY DEMONSTRATES THE POWER OF COMING FORWARD IN DEFINING LAWLESS ORDERS FROM THE PRESIDENT
YOU0000004002_S0003844 THANK YOU CHAIRMAN

YOU0000004002_S0003926 THE HOLD NEVERTHELESS CONTINUED THROUGH SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH EVEN AFTER NOW AS AN ASIDE
YOU0000004002_S0003939 THAT IS NOT WHAT I HEARD FROM YOU
YOU0000004002_S0003959 AMBASSADOR HILL
YOU0000004002_S0003973 AND THAT SHE SERVED WITH GRACE AND DIGNITY
YOU0000004002_S0003978 WAS WRONG
YOU0000004002_S0003993 INDEED I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU IN THE STRONGEST TERMS POSSIBLE
YOU0000004002_S0004005 SIR THE ONLY INFORMATION THAT I RECEIVED WAS FROM THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET THAT THEY WERE OPERATING AT THE DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT AND THEY REPORTED THAT HE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT CORRUPTION
YOU0000004002_S0004014 CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT THAT CHANGE WAS
YOU0000004002_S0004029 THE AIDE ACTUALLY GETS RELEASED
YOU0000004010_S0000112 SAYING IF RECENT ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE IT WAS INHUMAN AND HAS NO PLACE IN OUR COMPANY
YOU0000004010_S0000122 CITING
YOU0000004010_S0000130 PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON'S OFFICE SAID THAT HER DEPARTURE WAS THE RIGHT DECISION WHILE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION ED MILIBAND AGREED BUT SUGGESTED THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE DEPARTED TEN DAYS EARLIER
YOU0000004010_S0000145 AT THE NEWS OF THE WORLD HE REPORTED TO ASSISTANT EDITOR IAN EDMONDSON
YOU0000004010_S0000182 THESE ARRESTS CAME THIRTEEN YEARS AFTER REES' PREMISES WERE RAIDED UNDER OPERATION NIGERIA DURING WHICH LARGE AMOUNTS OF EVIDENCE INDICATING WIDESPREAD ILLEGAL TRAFFICKING IN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WAS SEIZED BY THE METROPOLITAN POLICE SERVICE
YOU0000004010_S0000230 ALAN KING AND PAUL MARSHALL PLEADED GUILTY TO CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MISCONDUCT IN A PUBLIC OFFICE
YOU0000004010_S0000245 BROOKS AND THE FIVE REMAINING DEFENDANTS WERE FOUND NOT GUILTY
YOU0000004010_S0000258 IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE SUN IMPROPERLY OBTAINED MEDICAL INFORMATION ON BROWN'S INFANT SON TO PUBLISH STORIES ABOUT HIS DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS
YOU0000004010_S0000283 FROM THAT INSIGHT CAME THE REALISATION THAT THE PAPER HAD A POTENTIAL CIVIL LIABILITY FROM ITS HACKING PRACTICES AND THAT LED TO TAYLOR'S CIVIL CASE
YOU0000004010_S0000292 AN INVESTIGATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMISSIONER SIR PAUL STEPHENSON AND NEIL WALLIS AND THE COMMISSIONER'S STAY AT CHAMPNEYS HEALTH RESORT
YOU0000004010_S0000310 GROSSMAN ALSO CLAIMED THAT NEWS CORPORATION CHANGES THE CULTURE OF THEIR NEWLY ACQUIRED NEWS OUTLETS USING THEM TO PROMOTE MURDOCH'S POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL INTERESTS
YOU0000004010_S0000316 IN THE END WHAT YOU SOW IS WHAT YOU REAP
YOU0000004010_S0000323 BUT FIRST GET IT RIGHT
YOU0000004010_S0000329 EVEN THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS A WARRANT TO GET INTO A HOUSE OR A COMPUTER
YOU0000004010_S0000346 WHILE THE SCOPE OF THE ENQUIRY WAS YET TO BE FINALISED A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER STEPHEN CONROY SAID THAT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION UNDER THE LABOR PARTY HAD DECIDED THAT AN INVESTIGATION WAS REQUIRED
YOU0000004010_S0000355 MANY OBSERVERS WERE FRUSTRATED BY THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S COMMENTS
YOU0000004010_S0000398 ALSO ARRESTED WERE A FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD MALE PRISON OFFICER AND A FIFTY YEAR OLD WOMAN
YOU0000004010_S0000423 CTB V NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS
YOU0000004010_S0000428 OPERATION RUBICON
YOU0000004018_S0000720 NON-STOP
YOU0000004032_S0000012 I JUST WANNA ALSO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION THAT ROGER NORHAM
YOU0000004032_S0000035 THERE HAVE LONG BEEN TENSIONS BETWEEN NORTHERN NOMADS AND SEDENTARY SOUTHERNERS
YOU0000004032_S0000049 THE FESTIVAL WAS SEEN AS A CONTINUATION OF THIS FLAME OF PEACE AS IT IS CALLED
YOU0000004032_S0000068 THESE HAD A MAJOR EFFECT ON MALI'S ABILITY TO SUSTAIN ITS TOURISM SECTOR
YOU0000004032_S0000086 SHOWED A SERIOUS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE GEOGRAPHY
YOU0000004032_S0000096 THE
YOU0000004032_S0000104 LIKEWISE ADVENTURE TRAVEL CAN COMBINE WITH CULTURAL TOURISM
YOU0000004032_S0000113 AND THE POTENTIAL FOR UNLEASHING POWERFUL PRIMITIVE FORCES
YOU0000004032_S0000127 IN A FOCUS GROUP WITH SEVERAL YOUNG MEN IN TIMBUKTU ONE MAN SAID THAT BY DESTROYING THEIR LIVELIHOODS WHICH THEY FELT THESE TRAVEL WARNINGS WERE DOING
YOU0000004032_S0000139 THE MOVEMENT WAS OVERRUN BY A NUMBER OF MILITANT ISLAMIC GROUPS SEEKING TO BRING SALAFIST ISLAM INTO WEST AFRICA
YOU0000004032_S0000152 IN TIMBUKTU THEY SPECIFICALLY TARGETED WORLD HERITAGE SITES AS WELL
YOU0000004032_S0000157 SHARIA LAW CONSTITUTES A DIVINELY ORDAINED PATH OF CONDUCT THAT GUIDES MUSLIMS TOWARD A PRACTICAL EXPRESSION OF RELIGIOUS CONVICTION IN THIS WORLD
YOU0000004032_S0000164 PREVIOUSLY THE TRAVEL WARNINGS AFFECTED THE LIVELIHOODS OF THOSE WHO WORKED IN TIMBUKTU'S TOURISM ECONOMY WHICH ACCORDING TO THE MINISTER OF TOURISM WAS POTENTIALLY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE WORKING POPULATION IN TIMBUKTU
YOU0000004032_S0000173 DAMAGE ECONOMIES IF A TOURIST RESORT THAT THE CRUSADERS PATRONIZE IS HIT
YOU0000004032_S0000178 AND CERTAIN AREAS
YOU0000004032_S0000188 THANK YOU
YOU0000004032_S0000198 LAND OF HOSPITALITY ARE THE MAIN STAPLE OF TOURISM BROCHURES AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLICITY
YOU0000004032_S0000206 A WOLOF WORD UNJUSTLY TRANSLATED AS HOSPITALITY THAT IS IN FACT MUCH MORE COMPLEX
YOU0000004032_S0000214 DESPITE ITS UNANIMOUS SYMBOL OF SENEGALESE CULTURE
YOU0000004032_S0000219 BUT AS A COMMODITY OF THE TOURISM INDUSTRY BECOME PARTICULARLY INTERESTING
YOU0000004032_S0000227 THE PHOTO FROM THE SENEGALESE TOURISM PROMOTION AGENCY
YOU0000004032_S0000235 WAS INTENDED TO PLAY TO THE ULTIMATE STRENGTH OF SENEGAL
YOU0000004032_S0000244 THESE DEBATES EXTENDED INTO VOICED FRUSTRATIONS BETWEEN THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF RELIGIOSITY AS WELL
YOU0000004032_S0000249 TERANGA IS JUST A HANDOUT IT'S WHAT YOUNG MOODY BOYS DO INSTEAD OF GOING OUT TO FIND WORK JAGA SAID
YOU0000004032_S0000256 YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO BAMBA IS YOU DON'T EVEN PRAY
YOU0000004032_S0000264 THE HOST ENTHUSIASTICALLY CONTINUES WITH A KIND OF MORAL LESSON
YOU0000004032_S0000274 PARTICULARLY OF THE TOURISM INDUSTRY
YOU0000004032_S0000280 OF ONE OF THE MAJOR SUFI ORDERS
YOU0000004032_S0000286 IN MANY WAYS SENEGAL AND ITS INDUSTRIES HAVE SUFFERED BY PROXY FOR ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE REGION
YOU0000004032_S0000296 A NEW RESURGENCE HAS BEEN DETECTED RECENTLY IN GUINEA
YOU0000004032_S0000304 WHICH IS OFTEN FREQUENTED BY EUROPEAN TOURISTS WAS ATTACKED
YOU0000004032_S0000313 LIBYA TO FIGHT WITH ISIS
YOU0000004032_S0000319 IN
YOU0000004032_S0000333 AND SO THESE ANALYSES OF THESE CHANGING FORMS OF SUFISM IN SENEGAL TODAY
YOU0000004032_S0000340 GOOD AFTERNOON
YOU0000004032_S0000351 WITH NEARLY FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF JORDANIAN POPULATION BEING OF PALESTINIAN DESCENT
YOU0000004032_S0000357 WITHIN A DAY THE CITY WAS OVERFLOWING WITH NEARLY SIXTY THOUSAND TOURISTS BUT THEY WERE ALL PRIMARILY DOMESTIC VISITORS FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
YOU0000004032_S0000363 AND THEY DO NOT BUY THE EXPENSIVE SOUVENIRS
YOU0000004032_S0000373 HOWEVER HIGH RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE ENCOURAGED NEARLY ONE QUARTER OF THE WORKFORCE TO GO ABROAD
YOU0000004032_S0000379 AND RAISE THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
YOU0000004032_S0000386 BUT THERE ARE ALSO A MULTITUDE OF MORE COMPLEX ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
YOU0000004032_S0000393 AND INTERNATIONAL TOURISM IS A FICKLE FORM OF DEVELOPMENT
YOU0000004032_S0000400 FOR EXAMPLE LITERALLY OVERNIGHT THE TOURISM INDUSTRY OF EGYPT WAS NEARLY SHUT DOWN
YOU0000004032_S0000414 BUT THROUGH STRATEGIC MARKETING JORDAN HAS BEEN ABLE TO DEFINE A CLEAR TOURISM PRODUCT WHICH DRAWS TOURISTS FROM BOTH OF THE REGION AND FURTHER ABROAD
YOU0000004032_S0000427 FURTHER GOVERNMENT FINANCES HAVE BEEN REDUCED BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO INCREASE WELFARE SPENDING DURING THE ARAB SPRING AND AS A RESULT OF THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR
YOU0000004032_S0000436 ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE CHARLIE HEBDO ATTACKS TOOK PLACE IN PARIS
YOU0000004032_S0000446 FROM WORKING IN THE TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY SECTORS
YOU0000004032_S0000454 IS ATTACHED TO WHAT IS PERCEIVED TO BE MENIAL PHYSICAL
YOU0000004032_S0000463 CHILDREN WILL GREET TOURISTS AT AIRPORTS
YOU0000004032_S0000474 UPON COMPLETION OF NINTH GRADE JORDANIAN STUDENTS ARE SORTED INTO DIFFERENT STREAMS OF STUDY INCLUDING SCIENCE AND MATH
YOU0000004032_S0000480 MAKING THIS STREAM THE MOST CHALLENGING TO GET INTO HAS ALSO INCREASED STUDENTS' AND FAMILIES' DESIRES TO ATTAIN IT
YOU0000004032_S0000490 BUT NOW IN THIS INCREASINGLY PRIVATIZED TOURISM-BASED ECONOMY
YOU0000004032_S0000501 THANK YOU
YOU0000004032_S0000516 IN ANY CASE WHAT I DISCUSS DOES NOT MEET THE FEROCITY OF WHAT WE WOULD COMMONLY ASSOCIATE WITH TERRORISM OR THE CASES THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED EARLIER TODAY
YOU0000004032_S0000526 AND HOW DO THESE CORRELATE TO TERROR
YOU0000004032_S0000538 THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT RESPONDED TO THE THREAT OF THE SWINE FLU PANDEMIC BY CLOSING THE BORDER FOR TWO MONTHS JUST BEFORE THE SUMMER HIGH SEASON
YOU0000004032_S0000547 LIFE WAS THE SAME BUT BUSINESS WAS A LOT LESS THAN USUAL
YOU0000004032_S0000574 I THOUGHT THIS WAS GONNA GO BACKWARDS DO I HAVE TO POINT THIS SOMEWHERE
YOU0000004032_S0000586 AND FLIGHTS TO MEXICO
YOU0000004032_S0000596 EVEN IF JUST A PLACEBO
YOU0000004032_S0000602 IN CONTRAST THERE ARE OTHER DESTINATIONS
YOU0000004032_S0000610 IT HAS BEEN AND REMAINS PRETTY WHOLESOME AND CLEAN FOR FOUR INTERCONNECTED REASONS FIRST
YOU0000004032_S0000617 THUS THE URBAN SPACES ARE ACTUALLY MANICURED AND ORCHESTRATED ENCLAVES FOR STAGING SETS OF CONSUMER ACTIVITIES BASED ON RESTRICTED ACCESS TO AND INTERACTIONS WITH LOCALS
YOU0000004032_S0000626 TEN OUNCES OF WOOD HANDICRAFT CARVING
YOU0000004032_S0000635 EVEN THE IMPORTED EXOTIC ACTIVITIES ZIP LINES SCUBA DIVING SWIMMING ARE NOT INDIGENOUS CULTURAL PRACTICES
YOU0000004032_S0000645 BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY
YOU0000004032_S0000659 CANCUN IS THE NUMBER ONE TOURIST DESTINATION IN MEXICO WITH EIGHT MILLION ARRIVALS AND ACAPULCO IS THIRD
YOU0000004032_S0000676 HE BOUGHT AN OUNCE OF WEED AND YOU WERE STANDING THREE FEET FROM HIM
YOU0000004032_S0000695 THE TAXI DRIVER DESCRIBED THE SIGHTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE NARROW ROAD BUSTLING WITH BUSY LOCAL PEOPLE ON THE DUTCH SIDE OF THE ISLAND NAVIGATING UNEVEN SIDEWALKS ON THE WAY TO WORK SCHOOL
YOU0000004032_S0000707 ON NOTING MY SURPRISE REGARDING THE SECURITY INTEREST IN THE ISLAND THE DRIVER COMMENTED THAT TOURISM IN FRANCE REPRESENTED A THREAT TO ALL OF ITS TERRITORIES
YOU0000004032_S0000720 THE SPREAD OF THE ZIKA VIRUS
YOU0000004032_S0000737 A SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF CRIME IN THE REGION IS ALSO OBVIOUSLY INVOLVEMENT IN THE INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING
YOU0000004032_S0000749 REALLY RECENT
YOU0000004032_S0000760 THE RESPONSE OF CITIZENS IN THESE COUNTRIES HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE PRESSURE FELT BY GOVERNMENTS TO ACT
YOU0000004032_S0000780 MANAGERS AND THINGS LIKE THIS
YOU0000004032_S0000789 ALTHOUGH SOME RESEARCH SHOWS THAT TOURIST VISITORS
YOU0000004032_S0000799 RECENT SECURITY ISSUES INCLUDE WHAT'S BEEN TERMED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
YOU0000004032_S0000816 THIS IS FUELING FEARS THAT TOURISM
YOU0000004032_S0000831 AND RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'RE ENTERING A TIME OF DOUBLE UNCERTAINTY AFTER ALL WE HAVE ON THE ONE HAND AN INCREASINGLY COMPLICATED AND CONTRADICTORY POLITICAL TURMOIL AROUND THE WORLD AND
YOU0000004032_S0000838 THAT WHEN WE UNPACK AND PEEL AWAY MEDIA-DRIVEN DISCOURSES OF DANGER AND TOP-DOWN STATUS DEFINITIONS OF TERRORISM AND THE VEIL OF POLICY WE'RE GONNA SEE MUCH MORE
YOU0000004032_S0000843 SO THE FIRST ONE DEFINING AND DEFYING RISK AND DANGER
YOU0000004032_S0000850 UNSTABLE
YOU0000004032_S0000859 IN FACT AND FACES SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES AND DYNAMICS OF KIND OF HAVING VERY RECENT MOUNTING VIOLENCE MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH ORGANIZED CRIME
YOU0000004032_S0000866 THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT MAKE TOURISM DESTINATIONS INSECURE AND PERHAPS SUBJECT TO THINGS LIKE TRAVEL WARNINGS FOR FOREIGNERS
YOU0000004032_S0000875 ONLY FOR AMERICAN VISITORS
YOU0000004032_S0000892 AND CLEARLY THEY ARE PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SHAPING THE ON-THE-GROUND REALITIES AT TOURISTIC SITES AND ZONES SO I ENCOURAGE THE PANELISTS TO KEEP THINKING ALONG THESE LINES AND HOW SUCH THINGS DEFINE DANGER AND RISK
YOU0000004032_S0000901 THE CONNECTION TO DEVELOPMENT IS MOST EXPLICITLY THE CONCERN OF KIMBERLY'S PAPER
YOU0000004032_S0000909 LAUREN'S PAPER EXPLICITLY ARTICULATES THIS IN TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT THE TRULY MULTIFACETED HUMAN INSECURITY BUNDLE IMPLICATING PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS
YOU0000004032_S0000915 WHICH IS ALSO INDEED A QUOTIDIAN CONCEPT OF SECURITY
YOU0000004032_S0000927 WHICH IS RATHER LESS SPECTACULAR THAN TERRORISM
YOU0000004032_S0000932 AND URGENT POLITICS OF HERITAGE POLITICS AT HERITAGE AND TOURISTIC SITES AROUND THE GLOBE
YOU0000004032_S0000946 ACTUALLY
YOU0000004032_S0000960 I'LL GO OR DON'T YOU KNOW
YOU0000004032_S0000970 AND OVERWHELMINGLY IT'S VERY VERY POSITIVE CONCERNING JORDAN AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS REALLY WELL
YOU0000004032_S0000998 TRAVEL ADVISORIES ARE LIKE THESE ALARMS
YOU0000004032_S0001014 WITH SORT OF A BROADER COMPARISON IS TO LOOK AT THE EMBODIMENT OF THESE TRAVEL ADVISORIES THAT OFTEN IGNORE WHO EXACTLY THE NARRATIVE IS COMING FROM
YOU0000004032_S0001031 SO
YOU0000004040_S0000012 IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL PREFERENCES WITHIN IRAN
YOU0000004040_S0000029 AND AGAIN
YOU0000004040_S0000037 AND IT FAILED ALSO IN MANY OTHER FIELDS
YOU0000004040_S0000052 BEHAVIOR
YOU0000004040_S0000059 NONE OF THEM SUPPORTED THE PHILOSOPHY OF AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI
YOU0000004040_S0000079 WHAT WAS THIS REVOLUTION ABOUT
YOU0000004040_S0000091 WELFARE AND LIBERTIES
YOU0000004040_S0000106 WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IS FREEDOM AFTER EXPRESSION
YOU0000004040_S0000118 MUSLIMS
YOU0000004040_S0000146 HE CAME TO KHOMEINI AND SUGGESTED TO HIM
YOU0000004040_S0000162 BUT WHEN THERE IS A CLASH BETWEEN INTERESTS
YOU0000004040_S0000177 AND THEREFORE
YOU0000004040_S0000185 THAT THE MIDDLE EAST IS NOT ANY MORE THE SAME THAT WE HAVE KNOWN BEFORE
YOU0000004040_S0000192 WITH THAT ISSUE WITH THE ARAB SPRING
YOU0000004040_S0000202 OF ALIGNMENTS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND SAUDI ARABIA FOR EXAMPLE
YOU0000004040_S0000214 AND ISRAEL IS THERE
YOU0000004040_S0000226 AND WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT SHIITE ISLAM WHEN I WAS AT COLLEGE
YOU0000004040_S0000238 HE WAS CRUSHED
YOU0000004040_S0000253 AND DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ON IRANIAN POLICY ON TWO KEY ISSUES THAT I THOUGHT IT'D BE VITAL TO TACKLE
YOU0000004040_S0000265 THE PEOPLE IN HUMANITIES ARE NOT GOOD IN THE TECHNOLOGY
YOU0000004040_S0000282 IN THE PERSIAN GULF I WOULD SAY
YOU0000004040_S0000293 UNDER OBAMA THAT HE'S WILLING TO LEAVE THE REGION
YOU0000004040_S0000306 SO THAT'S NOT THAT THEY ALL HATE
YOU0000004040_S0000320 YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT LASTED THIS PERMISSION
YOU0000004040_S0000327 IS CRUCIAL FOR THE HEZBOLLAH
YOU0000004040_S0000337 HAVE REALLY MADE
YOU0000004040_S0000360 AND WITH VICTORY COMES THE EUPHORIA
YOU0000004040_S0000368 BUT
YOU0000004040_S0000374 BECAUSE THEY ALSO THINK THAT THEY ARE UNDER THREAT
YOU0000004040_S0000382 THERE ARE MANY NATIONS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO COPE WITH FAILURE
YOU0000004040_S0000393 HE CONFUSED THE IRANIANS
YOU0000004040_S0000406 AND MEHDI TAEB COME IN A STATEMENT AND SAYS THAT SYRIA IS THE THIRTY FIFTH PROVINCE OF IRAN
YOU0000004040_S0000420 WE LOSE IRAN
YOU0000004040_S0000436 BUT I THINK THAT THE IDEA THAT IRAN SHOULD SPEND I WOULD SAY THAT IN TEN YEARS IF THEY CONTINUE TO HELP SYRIA AS THEY HAVE TODAY
YOU0000004040_S0000448 WITH OMAN
YOU0000004040_S0000462 SOME OF THEM CAME WITHOUT CERTIFICATES SO I THOUGHT THAT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP THE YOUNG PEOPLE
YOU0000004040_S0000472 WITH THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION
YOU0000004040_S0000486 ON THE ONE HAND THEY SAID AMERICA CANNOT DO ANY DAMN THING
YOU0000004040_S0000500 AND IN THE WEST BANK WITH THE MUSLIM
YOU0000004040_S0000513 BUT
YOU0000004040_S0000524 WHO ON YOUR SIDE SHOULD WE INVITE
YOU0000004040_S0000535 I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT ONE OUT OF FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE SAY THAT IF IRAN WILL BE NUCLEAR
YOU0000004040_S0000550 ALL EYES WERE GLUED TO ME
YOU0000004040_S0000563 WHY ISRAEL SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE IT IRAN NO
YOU0000004040_S0000578 SO IRAN IS POWERFUL IS GOING AHEAD
YOU0000004040_S0000586 TRADITION
YOU0000004040_S0000600 NO ONE KNOWS WHAT LEADS THE MASS THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY
YOU0000004048_S0000019 MAKING A PROFIT
YOU0000004048_S0000039 YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL WHAT INTEREST RATE YOU PAY
YOU0000004048_S0000060 BY THE WAY
YOU0000004066_S0000008 THAT HE'S HITTING UP CABLE NEWS HOSTS LIKE TUCKER CARLSON AND ASKING HIM
YOU0000004066_S0000017 AND SO
YOU0000004066_S0000026 PATHETIC LONGINGS
YOU0000004066_S0000038 THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME TO DO
YOU0000004066_S0000050 HE'S GOING TO LISTEN TO ME I'M GOING TO BE IN CHARGE
YOU0000004066_S0000068 IT'S THE SECOND MONTH IN A ROW BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVE OUTPERFORMED TRUMP'S REELECTION OPERATION
YOU0000004074_S0000014 HE SPEAKS TO US TONIGHT YOU WILL FIND OUT WHY
YOU0000004074_S0000024 ISLAM GOES
YOU0000004074_S0000033 SO EVERY DAY
YOU0000004074_S0000044 DEMOCRACY IS LIKE A BUS
YOU0000004074_S0000051 MANY OF YOU MIGHT KNOW RUMI
YOU0000004074_S0000062 ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES
YOU0000004074_S0000072 THE PROBLEMS ARISING IN THE MIDDLE EAST
YOU0000004074_S0000078 STARTING FROM
YOU0000004074_S0000086 ANOTHER PROBLEM AS THE ARAB SPRING STARTED
YOU0000004074_S0000099 THE JOURNALIST WHO PUBLISHED THESE
YOU0000004074_S0000110 TO THE SMALLEST VILLAGE
YOU0000004074_S0000116 AND DISTRIBUTED FROM THE CENTER
YOU0000004074_S0000128 TURKISH EDUCATION FOUNDATION
YOU0000004074_S0000151 BASICALLY FROM ISTANBUL TO SANLIURFA WHERE I WAS WORKING AS THE CHIEF OF COUNTER-TERRORISM
YOU0000004074_S0000177 ESTABLISHED A FRONT COMPANY CALLED POWER TRANS
YOU0000004074_S0000182 ALBAYRAK'S EMAILS AND THROUGH HIS EMAILS WE REALIZED THAT HE WAS MANAGING THIS POWER TRANS COMPANY
YOU0000004074_S0000190 IF TURKEY HAD NOT SUPPORTED THEM OPENLY
YOU0000004074_S0000203 AT THE TIME OF THE OPERATION HE CALLED HIS SON BILAL
YOU0000004074_S0000212 OF COURSE HE DENIED IT BUT THREE MONTHS LATER
YOU0000004074_S0000221 SELLING THE IRANIAN OIL AND GETTING GOLD
YOU0000004074_S0000228 HE HIRED A LOT OF LOBBYING FIRMS
YOU0000004074_S0000234 A NEW YORK FEDERAL JURY FOUND HIM GUILTY
YOU0000004074_S0000242 REZA ZARRAB THE MAIN SUSPECT IN THE
YOU0000004074_S0000256 OR THE SDF
YOU0000004074_S0000264 PARTICULARLY THE HAMAS AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD
YOU0000004074_S0000276 RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN
YOU0000004074_S0000288 OF COURSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE POWER
YOU0000004074_S0000297 WILLS
YOU0000004082_S0000006 I MET WITH HIM AND AFTER SPEAKING WITH HIM I TOOK OUT AN ARGENTINE BANK NOTE AND CUT IT IN HALF
YOU0000004082_S0000011 DON'T TRUST THEM
YOU0000004082_S0000016 TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE
YOU0000004082_S0000022 I FOLLOWED THE TRAIL FURTHER INTO THE DUSTY OUTSKIRTS OF BUENOS AIRES TO A LITTLE NO-MAN'S LAND WHERE THERE WEREN'T EVEN OFFICIAL PROPERTY LINES ON RECORD
YOU0000004082_S0000031 HUG YOUR KIDS
YOU0000004082_S0000036 WE WERE ON THE LAST TRAIN OUT OF GERMANY
YOU0000004082_S0000042 HEINRICH HIMMLER
YOU0000004082_S0000053 WHO ENGINEERED THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF EXTERMINATION
YOU0000004082_S0000058 FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY
YOU0000004082_S0000063 AND YET
YOU0000004082_S0000070 PUT A GUN TO HIS TEMPLE AND BLEW HIS BRAINS OUT IN THAT SAME BUNKER JOSEPH GOEBBELS KILLED ALL SIX OF HIS CHILDREN
YOU0000004082_S0000077 FLED TO AUSTRIA AND GOT A JOB AS A LUMBERJACK
YOU0000004082_S0000086 AND YES
YOU0000004082_S0000094 PROTECTED
YOU0000004082_S0000101 FATE DOES FUNNY THINGS SOMETIMES
YOU0000004082_S0000107 I THOUGHT ABOUT MY FAMILY
YOU0000004082_S0000115 AND THE NOOSE THAT HAD HUNG HIS FRIENDS AFTER THE WAR FOR WHAT THEY HAD DONE
YOU0000004082_S0000120 LITERALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
YOU0000004082_S0000129 SEVERAL SAFE HOUSES WERE RENTED AND PREPARED
YOU0000004082_S0000140 SO IF THERE WERE ANY WITNESSES THEY WOULD SEND THE POLICE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
YOU0000004082_S0000150 I PARKED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE METERS FROM THE MAIN ROAD
YOU0000004082_S0000156 THIS WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR THE MISSION
YOU0000004082_S0000164 HE MIGHT HAVE A GUN
YOU0000004082_S0000172 NO ONE FOLLOWED US
YOU0000004082_S0000178 I ASKED HIM IF HE UNDERSTOOD ME
YOU0000004082_S0000188 WHICH IN ENGLISH MEANS
YOU0000004090_S0000008 HE HAS TO TELL HIM TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE LEADER OF THAT CHURCH COMMUNITY DEOTREPHES IS ACTING LIKE A JERK AND HE'S REJECTING ANYBODY ASSOCIATED WITH JOHN THE ELDER
YOU0000004090_S0000013 IT READS MORE LIKE A POETIC SERMON SENT TO THESE CHURCHES
YOU0000004090_S0000021 IS
YOU0000004090_S0000026 IT MEANS FOR JOHN TO KEEP JESUS'S COMMANDS
YOU0000004090_S0000034 THAT GOD IS LOVE AND SO GOD'S CHILDREN SHOULD LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND AVOID HATRED
YOU0000004090_S0000039 AND SO JOHN WARNS ONCE AGAIN OF THE DECEIVERS THIS TIME HE CALLS THEM FALSE PROPHETS
YOU0000004090_S0000046 THAT LOVE BECOMES THE THING THAT GROUNDS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE THIS LOVE IS WHAT COMES THROUGH TRUSTING IN THE CRUCIFIED JESUS
YOU0000004098_S0000032 THIS GRACE WAS DEMONSTRATED WHEN JESUS GAVE UP HIS HONOR TO DIE A SHAMEFUL DEATH ON BEHALF OF HIS ENEMIES SO THAT HE COULD RESCUE AND REDEEM THEM
YOU0000004098_S0000045 SHOW THE BEAUTY OF THE MESSAGE ABOUT OUR SAVING GOD
YOU0000004106_S0000014 MAGNETIC INDUCTION CAPACITIVE COUPLING ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION ALL THESE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA AS WELL AS VARIOUS OTHER IDEAS SUCH AS CONDUCTION THROUGH AIR WERE TESTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMMUNICATION
YOU0000004106_S0000019 THE PHYSICAL PHENOMENON USED TODAY FOR LONG-DISTANCE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INVOLVES THE USE OF MODULATED ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
YOU0000004106_S0000029 ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
YOU0000004106_S0000037 AND TO POINT OUT AND EXPERIMENTALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DISCHARGE OF A CAPACITOR UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS IS OSCILLATORY OR AS HE PUTS IT CONSISTS OF A PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE IN ONE DIRECTION AND THEN SEVERAL REFLEX ACTIONS BACKWARD AND FORWARD EACH MORE FEEBLE THAN THE PRECEDING UNTIL EQUILIBRIUM IS ATTAINED
YOU0000004106_S0000046 THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD
YOU0000004106_S0000053 THIS CLAIMED TO UTILIZE ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY TO ELIMINATE THE OVERHEAD WIRE USED BY THE EXISTING TELEGRAPH SYSTEMS
YOU0000004106_S0000060 THE IDEA WAS NOT BASED ON THE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES DESCRIBED BY MAXWELL
YOU0000004106_S0000074 HE DEVELOPED AN IMPROVED DETECTOR TO PICK UP THIS UNKNOWN EXTRA CURRENT BASED ON HIS NEW MICROPHONE DESIGN AND DEVELOPED A WAY TO INTERRUPT HIS INDUCTION BALANCE TO PRODUCE A SERIES OF SPARKS
YOU0000004106_S0000082 AND THE WORLD WILL BE RIGHT IN PLACING HIS NAME ON THE HIGHEST PINNACLE IN RELATION TO AERIAL ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHY
YOU0000004106_S0000090 HERTZ WAS ABLE TO HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER THE FREQUENCIES OF HIS RADIATED WAVES BY ALTERING THE INDUCTANCE AND CAPACITANCE OF HIS TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING ANTENNAS
YOU0000004106_S0000097 AFTER HERTZ'S EXPERIMENTS
YOU0000004106_S0000106 FROM WHICH CAUSE THIS PIECE OF APPARATUS WAS TERMED BY SIR OLIVER LODGE A COHERER

YOU0000004106_S0000120 HE WENT ON TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT HIS IDEAS OF POWER TRANSMISSION AND WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION IN HIS VERY LARGE BUT UNSUCCESSFUL WARDENCLYFFE TOWER PROJECT
YOU0000004106_S0000129 LODGE ONE OF THE FIRST INVESTIGATORS TO NOTICE AND MEASURE STATIONARY WAVES ON WIRES PRODUCED BY DIRECT COUPLING WITH THE COATINGS OF A LEYDEN JAR WAS SIR OLIVER LODGE ENTITLED EXPERIMENTS ON THE DISCHARGE OF LEYDEN JARS
YOU0000004106_S0000138 HE LATER IMPROVED BRANLY'S COHERER BY ADDING A TREMBLER WHICH DISLODGED CLUMPED FILINGS
YOU0000004106_S0000146 THE FILINGS THUS VIRTUALLY TAKE THE PLACE OF A KEY IN THE ORDINARY TELEGRAPH CIRCUIT
YOU0000004106_S0000151 BY SETTING UP ELECTRIC OSCILLATIONS FOR PERIODS OF TIME CORRESPONDING TO DOTS AND DASHES MESSAGES MAY BE TRANSMITTED FROM THE SENDING STATION AND IF
YOU0000004106_S0000159 MR MARCONI AND SIR WILLIAM PREECE TOGETHER INTERESTED THE WHOLE WORLD IN THE SUBJECT GREAT POWER WAS APPLIED TO THE SENDER AND THE MATTER BECAME OF FINANCIAL IMPORTANCE
YOU0000004106_S0000169 AND DESCRIBED BY HIM AT THE END OF HIS PAPER ON A NEW ELECTRO POLARISCOPE ALLOWED FOR THE SENSIBILITY AND RANGE TO APPEAR TO LEAVE LITTLE TO BE DESIRED AT THE TIME
YOU0000004106_S0000178 ALEXANDER STEPANOVICH POPOV OF KRONSTADT RUSSIA WAS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RUSSIAN TORPEDO SCHOOL
YOU0000004106_S0000188 ON THIS DAY POPOV PERFORMED A PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION OF TRANSMISSION AND RECEPTION OF RADIO WAVES USED FOR COMMUNICATION AT THE RUSSIAN PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL SOCIETY USING HIS COHERER
YOU0000004106_S0000194 POPOV WAS THE FIRST TO DEVELOP A PRACTICAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM BASED ON THE COHERER AND IS USUALLY CONSIDERED BY THE RUSSIANS TO HAVE BEEN THE INVENTOR OF RADIO
YOU0000004106_S0000205 THERE'S SOME DISPUTE REGARDING THE FIRST PUBLIC TEST OF THIS DESIGN
YOU0000004106_S0000213 LATER POPOV EXPERIMENTED WITH SHIP-TO-SHORE COMMUNICATION
YOU0000004106_S0000226 IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT MARCONI BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THAT RADIO WAVES COULD BE USED FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
YOU0000004106_S0000237 DURING THIS TIME SPARK-GAP WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY WAS WIDELY RESEARCHED
YOU0000004106_S0000246 MARCONI'S WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY WAS INSPECTED BY THE POST OFFICE TELEGRAPH AUTHORITIES THEY MADE A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WITH MARCONI'S SYSTEM OF TELEGRAPHY WITHOUT CONNECTING WIRES
YOU0000004106_S0000253 OTHER EXPERIMENTAL STATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED AT LAVERNOCK POINT NEAR PENARTH ON THE FLAT HOLMES AN ISLAND IN MID-CHANNEL AND AT BREAN DOWN
YOU0000004106_S0000263 A SET OF INSTRUMENTS WERE FITTED UP IN A ROOM AT KINGSTOWN
YOU0000004106_S0000270 ISLE OF WIGHT AND KEPT UP WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FOR THREE WEEKS BETWEEN THESE STATIONS
YOU0000004106_S0000281 PREECE CONTINUING IN THE LECTURE DETAILS THE WORK OF MARCONI AND OTHER BRITISH INVENTORS
YOU0000004106_S0000292 BRADFORD HAS RECENTLY CONTESTED THE REPORTED SUCCESS
YOU0000004106_S0000298 THE POLDHU TO NEWFOUNDLAND TRANSMISSION CLAIM HAS BEEN CRITICIZED
YOU0000004106_S0000304 IN THIS PERIOD A PARTICULAR ELECTROMAGNETIC RECEIVER CALLED THE MARCONI MAGNETIC DETECTOR OR HYSTERESIS MAGNETIC DETECTOR WAS DEVELOPED FURTHER BY MARCONI AND WAS SUCCESSFULLY USED IN HIS EARLY TRANSATLANTIC WORK AND IN MANY OF THE SMALLER STATIONS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS
YOU0000004106_S0000312 AT THE START THE PASSING EVENTS WERE PRINTED IN A LITTLE PAMPHLET OF FOUR PAGES CALLED THE CUNARD BULLETIN
YOU0000004106_S0000319 AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE BRITISH ADMIRALTY FOR HIRE OR PURCHASE WHENEVER THEY MAY BE REQUIRED
YOU0000004106_S0000336 THIS SYSTEM WAS MORE ADVANCED THAN HIS PREVIOUS WORKS
YOU0000004106_S0000342 WHICH WAS AN IMPROVEMENT OF THE INITIAL INVENTION WAS ANTICIPATED BY PATENTS ISSUED TO OLIVER LODGE AND JOHN STONE BRAUN FERDINAND BRAUN'S MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS WERE THE INTRODUCTION OF A CLOSED TUNED CIRCUIT IN THE GENERATING PART OF THE TRANSMITTER AND ITS SEPARATION FROM THE RADIATING PART BY MEANS OF INDUCTIVE COUPLING
YOU0000004106_S0000348 PIONEERS WORKING ON WIRELESS DEVICES EVENTUALLY CAME TO A LIMIT OF DISTANCE THEY COULD COVER
YOU0000004106_S0000354 ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COLLEAGUES CANTOR AND ZENNECK WENT TO CUXHAVEN TO CONTINUE THEIR EXPERIMENTS AT THE NORTH SEA
YOU0000004106_S0000363 BRAUN SHOWED HOW THE PROBLEM COULD BE SATISFACTORILY AND ECONOMICALLY SOLVED
YOU0000004106_S0000369 BRAUN AVOIDED THE USE OF EXTREMELY HIGH POTENTIALS FOR CHARGING THE GAP AND ALSO MAKES USE OF A LESS WASTEFUL GAP BY SUB-DIVIDING IT
YOU0000004106_S0000375 MORE THAN SEVENTY UNITED STATES PATENTS HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO THIS PATENTEE ALONE
YOU0000004106_S0000383 AND AN ELEVATED CONDUCTOR AND MEANS FOR DEVELOPING THEREIN FORCED SIMPLE ELECTRIC VIBRATIONS OF CORRESPONDING FREQUENCY
YOU0000004106_S0000391 THE REPORT NOTED THAT THE SYSTEM WAS WELL ADAPTED FOR USE IN SQUADRON SIGNALLING
YOU0000004106_S0000396 THE BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT THE SYSTEM WAS GIVEN A TRIAL BY THE US NAVY
YOU0000004106_S0000406 FESSENDEN EVOLVED THE HETERODYNE PRINCIPLE HERE WHERE TWO SIGNALS COMBINED TO PRODUCE A THIRD SIGNAL
YOU0000004106_S0000417 AND THAT HE DID NOT EMPLOY A COHERER OR ANY FORM OF IMPERFECT CONTACT
YOU0000004106_S0000423 THESE PATENTS INVOLVED MANY NEW PRINCIPLES
YOU0000004106_S0000432 FESSENDEN WOULD ALSO USE DUPLEX AND MULTIPLEX COMMUTATOR METHODS
YOU0000004106_S0000442 FLEMING RECOGNIZED THE USE OF THE RECTIFYING PROPERTIES OF A WIRELESS TUBE FOR THE INDICATION OF HIGH FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS AND USED IT AS A ELECTROMAGNETIC DETECTOR
YOU0000004106_S0000449 HE WAS PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY OF THE DE FOREST RADIO TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH COMPANY

YOU0000004338_S0000093 IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETY S WE'VE BOUGHT ABOUT SIXTEEN KILOGRAMS FROM THE RUSSIANS BUT THEY'VE STOPPED PRODUCING IT AS WELL
YOU0000004338_S0000102 IN THE PROCESS IT WILL TIE UP MUCH OF THE NATION'S RESEARCH REACTOR CAPABILITIES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE
YOU0000004338_S0000122 MOST OF IT WOULD BE DIRECTLY USEFUL TO MAKING ENERGY FROM THORIUM
YOU0000004338_S0000132 WE CAN GENERATE PRIMARY HEAT FOR POWER AND ALSO A VERY VALUABLE BYPRODUCT IN THE FORM OF DESALINATED WATER
YOU0000004338_S0000154 WHICH IS REALLY DUMB IN MY OPINION
YOU0000004338_S0000175 THE BAN DOES NOT EXIST TODAY
YOU0000004338_S0000194 FROM THE INDIANS IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHEN THEY STARTED THAT THIRD STAGE I DON'T THINK THEY'RE AT THE THIRD STAGE AND I THINK THEY'RE AT THE SECOND STAGE WITH FAST BREEDERS AND PLUTONIUM FUEL WITH THORIUM TARGETS
YOU0000004346_S0000017 THANKS FOR WATCHING
YOU0000004354_S0000016 SEED POTATOES
YOU0000004354_S0000025 WE'VE GOT THE HOLES DRILLED
YOU0000004354_S0000044 SEE THE LEVEL RIGHT THERE
YOU0000004354_S0000057 WHEN YOU GET YOUR POTATOES IN YOU WANT TO PUT SOME BONE MEAL ON TOP OF THIS AND LET THAT SOAK DOWN TO THOSE POTATO SEEDS
YOU0000004362_S0000005 AND WHILE THE CENTRAL POWERS WEREN'T EXPECTING A RUSSIAN OFFENSIVE OF THIS MAGNITUDE
YOU0000004362_S0000011 THE NORTHERN PART WAS FACING CHIEF OF STAFF ERICH LUDENDORFF
YOU0000004362_S0000021 OVER TEN-THOUSAND GUNS WERE MANUFACTURED EACH MONTH AND MOST FRONT UNITS HAD RECEIVED MULTIPLE CANNONS AND GUNS
YOU0000004362_S0000027 THING IS THE ALLIED POWERS AGREED TO THE SOMME OFFENSIVE DURING THAT MEETING AND AFTER THE GERMANS RUINED THE INITIAL PLAN WITH THEIR VERDUN OFFENSIVE
YOU0000004362_S0000033 WITHIN ONE DAY THE RUSSIANS WERE PUSHED BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL STARTING POSITION
YOU0000004362_S0000040 RATHER THAN RETREATING
YOU0000004362_S0000045 BRUSILOV'S REASONING WAS THAT THE GERMANS HAD A BETTER RAILROAD CONNECTION AND BY ATTACKING THE ENTIRE FRONTLINE
YOU0000004362_S0000052 AS BRUSILOV LEFT THIS MEETING
YOU0000004362_S0000061 THE AUSTRIAN-HUNGARIAN FRONTLINE THAT BRUSILOV HAD TO BREAK THROUGH WAS REINFORCED AND OVER MOST OF THE FRONTLINE IT CONSISTED OF THREE DEFENSIVE LINES
YOU0000004362_S0000067 IT WAS NASTY
YOU0000004362_S0000075 IN TOTAL IT IS ESTIMATED THAT DURING THE ENTIRETY OF THE OFFENSIVE OVER ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION RUSSIAN SOLDIERS PARTICIPATED WHEREAS A LITTLE OVER A MILLION GERMAN AND AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN SOLDIERS
YOU0000004362_S0000082 THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE AND THE LACK OF MORALE AMONG THE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN AND CZECH TROOPS
YOU0000004362_S0000087 DUE TO THE RUSSIAN SHELLING
YOU0000004362_S0000095 WEAKENING THEIR VERDUN OFFENSIVE
YOU0000004362_S0000100 IN ORDER TO FIGHT THE RUSSIANS THE PROMISED ASSAULT ON THE EIGHTEENTH WAS CANCELED ONCE AGAIN BY GENERAL EVERT
YOU0000004362_S0000106 EXACTLY WHAT BRUSILOV PREDICTED HAPPENED THE GERMANS ONCE THEY NOTICED EVERT'S TROOPS MOVING TO THE SOUTH
YOU0000004362_S0000115 NUMBERED AT LEAST HALF A MILLION BUT COULD BE AS MUCH AS A MILLION SOLDIERS
YOU0000004362_S0000120 BRUSILOV LATER ON CLAIMED THAT RUSSIA COULD HAVE WON THE WAR IF HIS SUCCESSFUL OFFENSIVE WAS UTILIZED ADEQUATELY
YOU0000004362_S0000126 IT MAY HAVE BEEN THANKS TO HIM

YOU0000004461_S0000163 IT WAS GOD WHO INITIATED AND CONVEYED THE ARK'S PLANS
YOU0000004461_S0000169 THE ACCOUNTS OF ADAM AND EVE
YOU0000004461_S0000175 INCLUDING COMMUNICATION SOCIALIZATION CRITICAL THINKING
YOU0000004461_S0000182 AND FROM NOAH BACK TO THE FIRST CREATED COUPLE ADAM AND EVE
YOU0000004461_S0000190 WHO WAS A RELATIVE CONTEMPORARY OF NOAH
YOU0000004461_S0000196 AND NOAH NEEDED LOTS OF IT NOAH WOULD HAVE HAD TO GATHER WOOD FOR A LARGE VARIETY OF STRUCTURAL PURPOSES LARGE LOAD-BEARING BEAMS FOR THE PRIMARY FRAMING OF THE ARK'S STRUCTURE
YOU0000004461_S0000201 SINCE THERE WOULD BE ONLY ONE DOOR TO ENTER INTERNAL RAMPS OR STAIRS WOULD PROVIDE A MEANS TO MOVE BETWEEN DECKS
YOU0000004461_S0000207 BUT LET'S ALSO CONSIDER SOME ADDITIONAL BIBLICAL REFERENCES TO VARIOUS VOCATIONS THAT WERE IN EXISTENCE EVEN PRIOR TO NOAH
YOU0000004461_S0000213 WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT PRIOR TO NOAH FOR OVER ONE THOUSAND YEARS MANKIND HAD WORKED
YOU0000004461_S0000219 WE KNOW THE SKILL OF TENDING FLOCKS AND RAISING CATTLE CONTINUED THROUGHOUT SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS
YOU0000004461_S0000224 THE BIBLE DESCRIBES JUBAL AS THE FATHER OF ALL THOSE WHO PLAY THE HARP AND FLUTE THE PRODUCTION OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS STRINGED INSTRUMENTS AND WIND INSTRUMENTS
YOU0000004461_S0000231 PRY-BARS AND MAYBE SOME FORMS OF WOOD-CUTTING SAWS
YOU0000004461_S0000237 STRAPPINGS AND BRACINGS
YOU0000004461_S0000242 THE GREAT PYRAMID STANDS AS AN AMAZING EXAMPLE OF MANKIND'S CAPABILITIES
YOU0000004461_S0000248 ITS MASSIVE STONE STRUCTURE ACTUALLY ENCOMPASSES A VOLUME OVER FIFTY TIMES THAT OF THE ARK
YOU0000004461_S0000254 THE WOOD COMPOSITION WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR EASIER TO GATHER CUT AND INSTALL
YOU0000004461_S0000260 WE GAUGE THIS FROM NOAH BEING FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHEN HE AND HIS WIFE BEGAN TO HAVE THEIR SONS IN GENESIS CHAPTER FIVE
YOU0000004461_S0000266 IT'S USUALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY WERE ALL INVOLVED IN THE PREPARATION PROCESS
YOU0000004461_S0000272 OR
YOU0000004461_S0000277 AND BLACKSMITHING PROBABLY DEPENDED ON OTHER EXISTING TRADES AND SERVICES LIKE MARKETPLACES TO SELL AND TRADE GOODS
YOU0000004461_S0000283 THEN THERE WERE NEARLY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION MAN-HOURS
YOU0000004461_S0000289 ONLY ACCOUNTING FOR THE TIME HIS FAMILY WOULD CONTRIBUTE
YOU0000004461_S0000294 IN THE TIME GOD PROVIDED
YOU0000004469_S0000006 NOW GO TO ADVANCED MESSAGING
YOU0000004469_S0000013 TYPE IN AN EXPLANATION OF WHAT YOU'LL BE NOTIFYING YOUR USERS ABOUT AND BE SPECIFIC SO YOU DON'T RECEIVE ANY UNNECESSARY COMPLAINTS
YOU0000004469_S0000018 USING AN OTN TO SEND A MESSAGE WORKS SIMILAR TO ADDING A MESSAGE TAG
YOU0000004469_S0000029 IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE THE LEARNING OR NEED SUPPORT PLEASE JOIN ME OVER ON FACEBOOK IN THE FREE BABY GOT BOT GROUP
YOU0000004477_S0000011 NOW ANYONE RUNNING GOOGLE ADS ON THE SHOPPING NETWORK
YOU0000004477_S0000028 I WANT TO MAKE THEIR LIVES MISERABLE
YOU0000004477_S0000052 IF YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT YET I WANT YOU TO REALLY PAUSE AND THINK ABOUT THAT
YOU0000004477_S0000072 AND AS A RESULT OF BEING ABLE TO DO THAT
YOU0000004477_S0000087 NEXT YOU HAVE TO TURN ON WHAT I LIKE TO REFER TO AS THE POWER SWITCHES
YOU0000004477_S0000093 ALGORITHMS CHANGING
YOU0000004477_S0000101 SO AT THE END I'VE GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU GUYS CAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT'S NOT DOING ECOMM
YOU0000004477_S0000114 AND THIS IS THE BEAUTY OF IT
YOU0000004477_S0000122 AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY PUSH THE ALGORITHM TO CONSISTENTLY JUST GO OUT AND FIND MORE OF YOUR IDEAL CUSTOMERS
YOU0000004477_S0000134 ALRIGHT LET'S GO
YOU0000004477_S0000142 IN ORDER TO CREATE A FEED IF YOU'RE USING SHOPIFY
YOU0000004477_S0000149 LITERALLY
YOU0000004477_S0000160 SO OBVIOUSLY
YOU0000004477_S0000171 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MERCHANT CENTER LIKES TO HAVE IS ALL YOUR PRODUCT DATA AND INFORMATION SO THE SKU NUMBER OF THE PRODUCTS
YOU0000004477_S0000189 SO LASTLY NOW WE GOT TO SET UP THESE CAMPAIGNS
YOU0000004477_S0000203 NEXT IS
YOU0000004477_S0000215 BUT THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS IS THE MORE NEGATIVE KEYWORDS THAT YOU GIVE GOOGLE THE LESS PEOPLE THEY START TRIGGERING YOU FOR THAT YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR
YOU0000004477_S0000242 WHAT'S WORKING AND NOT WORKING
YOU0000004477_S0000264 YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE OBVIOUSLY WHAT YOU'RE PAYING PER CLICK
YOU0000004477_S0000275 IF YOU GUYS NEED TO DO THIS
YOU0000004477_S0000291 TWO PERCENT CONVERSION RATE
YOU0000004477_S0000303 I'M NOT THE SUPER SMART MARKTER
YOU0000004477_S0000320 AND THAT IS ALL
YOU0000004485_S0000008 BUT THE GENERAL DIVISION IS OVER WHO SHOULD SUCCEED MUHAMMAD AFTER HIS DEATH AS THE LEADER OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY
YOU0000004485_S0000013 BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THIS REVOLVES AROUND THE FAMILY OF MUHAMMAD
YOU0000004485_S0000020 NOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SEVERAL OF THESE FIGURES IN OTHER VIDEOS
YOU0000004485_S0000026 AND HE TAKES CUSTODY UNTIL MUHAMMAD IS EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN ABDUL-MUTTALIB DIES
YOU0000004485_S0000031 AND SHE EMPLOYS MUHAMMAD AND ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC TRADITION IS IMPRESSED BY HIM AND PROPOSES TO HIM AND SHE'S FIFTEEN YEARS OLDER THAN MUHAMMAD THIS IS HER THIRD MARRIAGE AND MUHAMMAD MARRIES HER
YOU0000004485_S0000037 AND ALI IS THE ALI THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHERE THE WORD SHIA SHI'ATU ALI COMES FROM PARTY OF ALI
YOU0000004485_S0000044 AND THEY ARE CONNECTED THROUGH AISHA
YOU0000004485_S0000053 IN PREVIOUS VIDEOS WE TALK ABOUT HIS FINAL PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA
YOU0000004485_S0000058 THERE'S ONE QUOTATION THAT SHIA CONSIDER TO BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT WHERE MUHAMMAD SAYS OF WHOMSOEVER I HAD BEEN MAWLA
YOU0000004485_S0000063 MANY MEMBERS OF THE SUNNI TRADITION TAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION WHERE THEY SAY MAWLA DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO MEAN PROTECTOR OR LEADER IT COULD MEAN COMPANION OR FRIEND OR MEMBER THAT IS CLOSE TO AND SO THEY DON'T VIEW THIS AS STRONGLY OF EVIDENCE
YOU0000004485_S0000068 AND ACCORDING TO THE TRADITION
YOU0000004485_S0000075 SOMETIMES PRONOUNCED AS OSMAN WHO IS THEN ASSASSINATED AND THEN ALI TAKES POWER
YOU0000004485_S0000081 AND ONCE AGAIN
YOU0000004493_S0000004 AND THAT LED TO THE BATTLES AROUND ILERDA
YOU0000004493_S0000010 YOU CAN EVEN TRACK CHARACTER ARCS AND USE THE MAP VIEW TO CREATE ALL THE LOCATIONS YOU NEED
YOU0000004493_S0000018 GET RID OF THE MESSY AND INEFFECTIVE WORD DOCUMENTS AND SPREADSHEETS
YOU0000004493_S0000024 AND WAS DAYS FROM BEING STARVED OUT
YOU0000004493_S0000030 MADE OF LIGHTWEIGHT TIMBER AND ANIMAL HIDES
YOU0000004493_S0000037 STABILISING HIS SUPPLY LINE AND ALLOWING THE REINFORCEMENTS FROM GAUL TO MEET UP WITH HIS LEGION ENCAMPED ON THE WEST SIDE
YOU0000004493_S0000043 THE SIEGE HAD THUS FAR BEEN UNEVENTFUL AHENOBARBUS HAD LARGELY SPENT HIS TIME AMASSING A LARGER NAVY
YOU0000004493_S0000049 AS WELL AS SEVERAL SMALLER VESSELS MANNED BY ARCHERS
YOU0000004493_S0000058 AS THE FLEETS MET
YOU0000004493_S0000066 THEIR HEAVY ARMOUR AND TRAINING ALLOWED THEM TO CUT THROUGH THE MASSILIANS ON BOARD ON OCCASION EVEN BOARDING TWO MASSILIANS SHIPS AT ONCE
YOU0000004493_S0000071 AND THE BLOCKADE CONTINUED
YOU0000004493_S0000076 AS A RESULT
YOU0000004493_S0000081 WHICH WOULD ALLOW EVEN MORE OF HIS MEN EASY ACCESS TO THE EASTERN BANK
YOU0000004493_S0000086 HE DECIDED TO MAKE A TACTICAL WITHDRAWAL TO FURTHER SPAIN TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT ON HIS OWN TERMS WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF VARRO'S TWO EXTRA LEGIONS
YOU0000004493_S0000091 ESTABLISHING A FORTIFIED POSITION IN PREPARATION FOR THE EVACUATION OF THE REST OF THE ARMY
YOU0000004493_S0000096 HOWEVER THE POMPEIAN LEGIONS HAD BEEN QUICK AND WERE ALREADY DUG IN
YOU0000004493_S0000101 AFRANIUS AND PETREIUS BEGAN MOVING THEIR ENTIRE ARMY OUT OF CAMP AND TO THE SOUTH
YOU0000004493_S0000106 HE FIRST SENT HIS CAVALRY TO HARASS THE POMPEIANS
YOU0000004493_S0000111 LEAVING ONE TO GUARD THE CAMP
YOU0000004493_S0000120 AFRANIUS DID NOT WANT TO RISK ATTEMPTING TO MARCH HIS ARMY THROUGH THE NARROW DEFILES WITH CAESAR PURSUING HIM
YOU0000004493_S0000125 AND SO AFRANIUS DECIDED THAT IT WAS BETTER INSTEAD TO ATTEMPT A FIGHTING RETREAT THE NEXT DAY
YOU0000004493_S0000130 SEEING THIS MANEUVERER
YOU0000004493_S0000136 CAESAR REACHED THE PASSES FIRST DRAWING HIS ARMY INTO A LINE CUTTING OFF THE POMPEIAN ESCAPE
YOU0000004493_S0000142 CAESAR WAS HAPPY TO LET HIM DO SO AND SAW NO POINT IN RISKING THE LIVES OF HIS MEN IN ANOTHER BATTLE
YOU0000004493_S0000148 IF THE POMPEIIANS STAYED THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY RUN OUT OF SUPPLIES
YOU0000004493_S0000154 HE HAD SENT MEN TO THE RIVER TO GATHER WATER
YOU0000004493_S0000165 BRINGING THEM BACK TO THEIR CAMPS TO DRINK AND RECONNECT
YOU0000004493_S0000173 IT SEEMS THAT HE TOO HAD LOST THE DESIRE TO CONTINUE THE BATTLE
YOU0000004493_S0000182 IN A LAST-DITCH ATTEMPT TO RETAKE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION
YOU0000004493_S0000188 ON THE THIRD DAY OF THIS HARASSMENT
YOU0000004493_S0000193 BLOCKADED ON ALL SIDES DEVOID OF WATER AND HAVING BEEN HARASSED FOR DAYS
YOU0000004493_S0000199 IN EXCHANGE FOR THE COMPLETE SURRENDER OF THE ARMY AND THE PROMISE THAT NONE OF THEM WOULD TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST HIM
YOU0000004493_S0000205 TO ACCOMPANY THE POMPEIANS TO A SAFE LOCATION AND DISBAND THEM
YOU0000004493_S0000213 HOWEVER NEWS OF CAESAR'S VICTORY AT ILERDA HAD SPREAD FAST AND THE LOCALS HAD SEEN THE WRITING ON THE WALL
YOU0000004493_S0000218 HAVING LOST THE SUPPORT OF HIS ARMY AND THE LOCALS
YOU0000004493_S0000223 POMPEY'S ENTIRE SPANISH ARMY HAD NOW EITHER BEEN DISBANDED OR HAD SIDED WITH CAESAR
YOU0000004493_S0000229 HAD CONSTRUCTED TRENCHES WALLS AND TOWERS BLOCKING OFF THE PENINSULA UPON WHICH THE CITY STOOD
YOU0000004493_S0000234 FUNNELLING ANY LAND FORCES ON TO ONE FRONT
YOU0000004493_S0000240 THE MASSILIANS HAD ALSO MADE REPAIRS TO THEIR FLEET FOLLOWING THEIR PREVIOUS DEFEAT
YOU0000004493_S0000245 THESE WERE COMMANDED BY LUCIUS NASIDIUS
YOU0000004493_S0000257 THE MASSILIAN SHIPS WERE STATIONED ON THE RIGHT WITH NASIDIUS AND HIS FLEET ON THE LEFT
YOU0000004493_S0000266 THEY WOULD PEPPER IT WITH JAVELINS AND ARROWS INFLICTING NUMEROUS CASUALTIES
YOU0000004493_S0000273 DISTINGUISHED BY ITS STANDARD
YOU0000004493_S0000281 BRUTUS HAD WON WITHOUT LOSING A SINGLE SHIP AND SUSTAINING ONLY LIGHT CASUALTIES
YOU0000004493_S0000286 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NASIDIUS
YOU0000004493_S0000292 MOST ONLY BEING CITIZENS WANTING TO FIGHT FOR THEIR CITY
YOU0000004493_S0000297 A WAY WAS NEEDED TO ASSAULT THE WALLS WITHOUT RISK OF MISSILE FIRE
YOU0000004493_S0000302 THEY THEN USED SCREWS AND LEVERS TO RAISE THIS LID
YOU0000004493_S0000307 WITH THIS COMPLETED
YOU0000004493_S0000314 LEGIONARY ENGINEERS BEGAN THE WORK OF UNDERMINING THE MASSILIAN TOWER
YOU0000004493_S0000319 THE MASSILIANS QUICKLY CAME OUT OF THE CITY
YOU0000004493_S0000324 ASKING IF THEY COULD AWAIT CAESAR'S ARRIVAL TO NEGOTIATE WITH HIM PERSONALLY
YOU0000004493_S0000329 THEY SALLIED OUT AT NIGHT
YOU0000004493_S0000338 THEY HAD NO MEANS OF BRINGING IN FRESH SUPPLIES INTO THE CITY
YOU0000004493_S0000344 CAESAR ARRIVED WITH HIS TWO EXTRA LEGIONS
YOU0000004493_S0000351 HE WAS STILL NOT READY TO GIVE UP THE FIGHT AND COMMANDEERING THREE SHIPS
YOU0000004493_S0000358 IN SEVEN MONTHS CAESAR HAD CHASED POMPEY FROM ITALY
YOU0000004493_S0000363 AHENOBARBUS HAD MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO GREECE TO RE-JOIN POMPEY

YOU0000004517_S0000052 THE STUFF ABOUT ME OR INTERESTING RUMORS THAT DEVELOPED ABOUT THE BOOK AND ALL THAT STUFF GETTING ATTENTION I FOUND THAT
YOU0000004517_S0000066 TO THINK ABOUT
YOU0000004517_S0000075 JEFFREY DAHMER WAS BORDERLINE LYNCHIAN
YOU0000004517_S0000083 THIS WEIRD
YOU0000004517_S0000092 BUT LYNCH'S CAREER FOR A WHILE HAD A KIND OF RICHARD RODRIGUEZ ARC TO IT
YOU0000004517_S0000102 AND IT WAS A HUGE FLOP AND I THINK LYNCH ATE THE FLOP AND DECIDED THAT WHAT HE WANTED TO DO IS HE WANTED TO
YOU0000004517_S0000114 BUT IN ALL FAIRNESS AND IN ALL RESPECT TO MICHAEL ONDAATJE FELT THE SAME WAY ABOUT THE BOOK

YOU0000004517_S0000305 I BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT BECAUSE MY STUFF ISN'T GOOD BUT BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T HAPPEN TO LIKE THIS KIND OF ESTHETIC IN FACT

YOU0000004533_S0000012 SPEAKING OF BETH CHAPMAN'S EX-HUSBAND SHE WAS SUPPOSEDLY UNFAITHFUL TO HIM DURING THEIR MARRIAGE LEAVING HIM BEHIND TO SEE DUANE INSTEAD
YOU0000004533_S0000019 WE STILL ARE VERY LUCKY

YOU0000004533_S0000044 THERE'S LOTS OF TREATMENTS OUT THERE SOME OF THEM ARE MORE HARMFUL THAN OTHERS
YOU0000004533_S0000051 IN A HEARTFELT TRIBUTE TO HIS WIFE DUANE TWEETED IT'S FIVE THIRTY TWO IN HAWAII
YOU0000004541_S0000011 I MET WITH MARYANNE AGAIN SHORTLY AFTER THE ARTICLE RAN
YOU0000004541_S0000018 WHICH SHE DID
YOU0000004549_S0000021 IN OUR COUNTRY
YOU0000004549_S0000080 THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME THE PARTY OF NERDS
YOU0000004549_S0000108 WELL THOSE CLIPS ARE FOREVER AND WILLIE
YOU0000004557_S0000018 WITH THAT LET'S WELCOME THE CANDIDATES TO THE STAGE
YOU0000004557_S0000028 NINE MONTHS AGO
YOU0000004557_S0000036 WHICH IS UNDERMINING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY
YOU0000004557_S0000042 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AROUND
YOU0000004557_S0000049 GETTING A CRIMINAL RECORD
YOU0000004557_S0000056 AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY
YOU0000004557_S0000063 I KNOW A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE ANGRY ABOUT THE ECONOMY
YOU0000004557_S0000068 THE ECONOMY IS RIGGED IN FAVOR OF THOSE AT THE TOP
YOU0000004557_S0000073 EDUCATION HOUSING AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
YOU0000004557_S0000079 THANK YOU BOTH AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK TO BEGIN QUESTIONS
YOU0000004557_S0000098 WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE UNITED STATES IN FACT SHOULD JOIN THE REST OF THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD AND GUARANTEE HEALTHCARE TO ALL PEOPLE
YOU0000004557_S0000112 EVERY PROGRESSIVE ECONOMIST WHO HAS ANALYZED THAT SAYS THAT THE NUMBERS DON'T ADD UP
YOU0000004557_S0000120 WHAT I SAID AND LET ME REPEAT IT
YOU0000004557_S0000128 AND WHY I AM A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PRINCIPAL ACCOMPLISHMENT NAMELY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS BECAUSE I KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS TO GET THAT DONE
YOU0000004557_S0000133 IF IT'S MEDICARE FOR ALL
YOU0000004557_S0000138 IS ALSO A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROGRAM
YOU0000004557_S0000145 THERE IS ONE MAJOR COUNTRY THE UNITED STATES WHICH ENDS UP SPENDING ALMOST THREE TIMES PER CAPITA WHAT THEY DO IN THE U K GUARANTEEING HEALTH CARE TO ALL PEOPLE
YOU0000004557_S0000153 SO WHAT WE HAVE TRIED TO DO AND WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SUCCEEDED IN DOING WAS TO BUILD ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE HAVE
YOU0000004557_S0000160 IN WHICH THESE WORDS WERE SAID THE ERA OF BIG GOVERNMENT IS OVER YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT
YOU0000004557_S0000166 IN MY CASE WHETHER IT'S HEALTH CARE OR GETTING US TO DEBT-FREE TUITION
YOU0000004557_S0000171 I'VE TRIED TO BE AS SPECIFIC TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SO THAT MY PROPOSALS CAN BE VETTED BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO LEVEL WITH PEOPLE FOR THE VERY REASON GWEN THAT YOU ARE MENTIONING
YOU0000004557_S0000178 I BELIEVE I CAN GET THE MONEY THAT I NEED BY TAXING THE WEALTHY BY CLOSING LOOPHOLES THE THINGS THAT WE ARE WAY OVERDUE FOR DOING AND I THINK ONCE I'M IN THE WHITE HOUSE WE WILL HAVE ENOUGH POLITICAL CAPITAL TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
YOU0000004557_S0000184 ROADS BRIDGES
YOU0000004557_S0000190 WE NEED TO CREATE JOBS SO YES
YOU0000004557_S0000198 WE BAILED THEM OUT NOW IT IS THEIR TIME TO HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS
YOU0000004557_S0000206 I AM A LITTLE SKEPTICAL ABOUT YOUR GOVERNOR ACTUALLY CARING ENOUGH ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION TO MAKE ANY KIND OF COMMITMENT LIKE THAT
YOU0000004557_S0000219 BUT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WOMEN VOTERS SUPPORTED AND VOTED FOR SENATOR SANDERS
YOU0000004557_S0000230 I THINK THAT WE STILL HAVE SOME BARRIERS TO KNOCK DOWN WHICH IS WHY THAT'S AT THE CORE OF MY CAMPAIGN
YOU0000004557_S0000243 I'M VERY PROUD THAT I SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE CONGRESS
YOU0000004557_S0000252 SOMEBODY WHO HAS SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE TAKING ON THE BIG MONEY INTERESTS
YOU0000004557_S0000264 ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT SAYING WE HATE THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT IS THE ENEMY
YOU0000004557_S0000270 MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES LOVE THE GOVERNMENT AND WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR EVERY WOMAN IN AMERICA IF THAT'S NOT HYPOCRISY I DON'T KNOW WHAT HYPOCRISY IS
YOU0000004557_S0000277 WAS NEARLY DOUBLE THE COUNTRY'S RATE
YOU0000004557_S0000284 WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS END OVER-POLICING IN AFRICAN AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS
YOU0000004557_S0000290 CLEARLY
YOU0000004557_S0000296 THE STATISTICS FROM WISCONSIN ARE PARTICULARLY TROUBLING
YOU0000004557_S0000303 HIS FAMILY CERTAINLY BELIEVES THAT AND SO DO I
YOU0000004557_S0000315 ARE PUSHED OUT OF SCHOOL EARLY
YOU0000004557_S0000323 WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS LOOK LIKE THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE IN THEIR DIVERSITY
YOU0000004557_S0000330 AND IT'S REALLY NOT A VERY RADICAL PLEDGE
YOU0000004557_S0000335 HERE'S MY PROMISE
YOU0000004557_S0000341 I'M JUST NOT SURE I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THAT ASSESSMENT
YOU0000004557_S0000347 I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SET A GREAT EXAMPLE I THINK HE HAS ADDRESSED A LOT OF THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN QUITE DIFFICULT
YOU0000004557_S0000354 BUT WE CAN'T REST WE HAVE WORK TO DO AND WE NOW KNOW A LOT MORE THAN WE EVER DID BEFORE
YOU0000004557_S0000362 TURNS OUT THAT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THE LATINO COMMUNITY WERE HIT ESPECIALLY HARD AS I UNDERSTAND IT
YOU0000004557_S0000368 IN OUR ECONOMY
YOU0000004557_S0000381 BY THE MIDDLE OF THIS CENTURY THE NATION IS GOING TO BE MAJORITY NONWHITE
YOU0000004557_S0000387 AND THAT INCLUDES WHITE COMMUNITIES
YOU0000004557_S0000392 THIS IS A REMARKABLE AND HORRIFYING FACT
YOU0000004557_S0000398 AND I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO ADDRESS DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES
YOU0000004557_S0000405 AND THAT'S WHY AS PRESIDENT I WILL LOOK AT COMMUNITIES THAT NEED SPECIAL HELP AND TRY TO DELIVER THAT
YOU0000004557_S0000415 THAN THEY USED TO BE WHY IS THAT
YOU0000004557_S0000423 NOW YOU ARE A WORKER
YOU0000004557_S0000429 THEY'RE MAKING A HALF TWO-THIRDS WHAT THEY USED TO MAKE THEIR KIDS ARE HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING ANY WORK AT ALL
YOU0000004557_S0000434 SUICIDE ALCOHOLISM
YOU0000004557_S0000441 HOW SPECIFICALLY WOULD YOU DO IT
YOU0000004557_S0000448 I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE GOT TO PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM SOMETHING THAT I STRONGLY SUPPORTED
YOU0000004557_S0000453 IS TO BRING FAMILIES TOGETHER
YOU0000004557_S0000461 WE USE THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS OF THE PRESIDENT
YOU0000004557_S0000469 I VOTED FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN SENATOR SANDERS VOTED AGAINST IT AT THAT TIME
YOU0000004557_S0000481 I DID VOTE AGAINST IT
YOU0000004557_S0000486 WERE EXPLOITED
YOU0000004557_S0000495 THIS WAS TED KENNEDY'S BILL
YOU0000004557_S0000505 SENATOR
YOU0000004557_S0000514 YOU KNOW YOU JUDGE A NATION
YOU0000004557_S0000519 WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY AMONG ALMOST ANY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH
YOU0000004557_S0000528 STARTING AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU0000004557_S0000536 BUT A GREAT NATION LIKE OURS SHOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION WHERE ELDERLY PEOPLE ARE CUTTING THEIR PILLS IN HALF
YOU0000004557_S0000542 BUT FOR DISABLED VETERANS AS WELL
YOU0000004557_S0000549 AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN DISADVANTAGED EVER SINCE
YOU0000004557_S0000555 BUT I WANT TO START BY HELPING THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST AT RISK THE ONES WHO YES
YOU0000004557_S0000564 I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD COME ONBOARD AND SAY THAT THIS IS THE SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD THING TO DO
YOU0000004557_S0000573 BUT NEARLY HALF OF YOUR FINANCIAL SECTOR DONATIONS APPEAR TO COME FROM JUST TWO WEALTHY FINANCIERS GEORGE SOROS AND DONALD SUSSMAN
YOU0000004557_S0000584 AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO REACH OUT TO THANK ALL MY ONLINE CONTRIBUTORS FOR EVERYTHING THEY ARE DOING FOR ME
YOU0000004557_S0000596 WHEN EXTRAORDINARILY WEALTHY PEOPLE MAKE VERY LARGE CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUPER PACS
YOU0000004557_S0000603 BUT WHAT WE DID IS WE SAID TO THE WORKING FAMILIES OF THIS COUNTRY LOOK WE KNOW THINGS ARE TOUGH
YOU0000004557_S0000618 WHICH NOW SAYS IT WANTS TO SUPPORT ME IT'S NOT MY PAC
YOU0000004557_S0000623 WHEN IT MATTERED
YOU0000004557_S0000630 PEOPLE AREN'T DUMB
YOU0000004557_S0000635 WHY DOES THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY PAY SPEND HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
YOU0000004557_S0000641 BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WALL STREET
YOU0000004557_S0000648 NO EXECUTIVE TOO POWERFUL TO JAIL
YOU0000004557_S0000653 IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH BECAUSE WHAT IT FOCUSES ON ARE THE BIG BANKS WHICH SENATOR SANDERS HAS TALKED ABOUT A LOT FOR GOOD REASON
YOU0000004557_S0000658 IT WAS A BIG INSURANCE COMPANY AIG IT WAS COUNTRYWIDE MORTGAGE
YOU0000004557_S0000665 I WANT TO GET AHEAD OF THOSE AND THAT'S WHY I'VE PROPOSED A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO DEAL WITH
YOU0000004557_S0000673 I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT
YOU0000004557_S0000696 WELCOME BACK TO THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BEFORE WE RETURN TO OUR QUESTIONS WE HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION FROM OUR FACEBOOK GROUP
YOU0000004557_S0000710 WHICH IS THE ONE MAJOR AGENCY OF GOVERNMENT THAT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE AUDITED
YOU0000004557_S0000718 SO WE HAVE TO GO AFTER THIS BOTH ABROAD AND AT HOME
YOU0000004557_S0000724 AND WE HAVE TO CUT OFF THE FLOW OF FOREIGN FUNDING AND FOREIGN FIGHTERS AND WE HAVE TO TAKE ON ISIS ONLINE
YOU0000004557_S0000729 WE NEED THE BEST POSSIBLE INTELLIGENCE NOT ONLY FROM OUR OWN SOURCES
YOU0000004557_S0000734 AND THEY NEED TO FEEL NOT JUST INVITED BUT WELCOMED WITHIN THE AMERICAN SOCIETY SO WHEN SOMEBODY LIKE DONALD TRUMP AND OTHERS
YOU0000004557_S0000741 SAY THIS
YOU0000004557_S0000747 BUT MUCH OF WHAT I FEARED WOULD HAPPEN WHEN I SPOKE ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE
YOU0000004557_S0000752 WE CAN OVERTHROW
YOU0000004557_S0000758 AND IN LIBYA FOR EXAMPLE
YOU0000004557_S0000763 ISIS CAME IN
YOU0000004557_S0000769 DEMOCRATICALLY-ELECTED PRIME MINISTER OF IRAN
YOU0000004557_S0000779 ON WHAT I THINK IS FAIR TO CALL A REGIME CHANGE RESOLUTION WITH RESPECT TO IRAQ
YOU0000004557_S0000787 AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE REALLY LOOK HARD AT WHAT THE THREATS AND DANGERS WE FACE ARE
YOU0000004557_S0000792 TO BECOME SECRETARY OF STATE
YOU0000004557_S0000801 I WOULD IMAGINE
YOU0000004557_S0000806 SHE VOTED FOR IT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY
YOU0000004557_S0000813 AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IT WAS THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION
YOU0000004557_S0000820 OF HENRY KISSINGER
YOU0000004557_S0000825 KISSINGER'S ACTIONS IN CAMBODIA
YOU0000004557_S0000833 THAT WITH RESPECT TO CHINA ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE
YOU0000004557_S0000841 THE DOMINO THEORY YOU KNOW IF VIETNAM GOES
YOU0000004557_S0000847 YOU'RE RIGHT HE OPENED UP RELATIONS WITH CHINA
YOU0000004557_S0000854 LET ME LET ME MOVE ON TO ANOTHER COUNTRY WITH WHICH THE U S HAS A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP
YOU0000004557_S0000864 THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED MEN WOMEN TWENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN
YOU0000004557_S0000871 WE HAVE TO WORK WITH NATO TO PROTECT EASTERN EUROPE AGAINST ANY KIND OF RUSSIAN AGGRESSION
YOU0000004557_S0000881 WHICH SET FORTH A CEASE-FIRE AND MOVING TOWARD A POLITICAL RESOLUTION TRYING TO BRING THE PARTIES AT STAKE IN SYRIA TOGETHER THIS IS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED
YOU0000004557_S0000890 LET ME JUST JUST SAY THIS
YOU0000004557_S0000897 REACH NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH CUBA AND BY THE WAY I HOPE WE CAN END THE TRADE EMBARGO WITH CUBA AS WELL
YOU0000004557_S0000902 BUT TO HAVE THE GOAL OF TRYING TO IMPROVE RELATIONS
YOU0000004557_S0000908 YES THEY HAVE TO STOP TRYING TO DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST CAUSING EVEN MORE CHAOS
YOU0000004557_S0000918 WE DID NOT MEET WITH ANYBODY WITHOUT CONDITIONS THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH
YOU0000004557_S0000928 AS WELL AS OUR WILLINGNESS TO TAKE REFUGEES SO LONG AS THEY ARE THOROUGHLY VETTED AND THAT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE FROM INTELLIGENCE AND OTHER SOURCES THAT THEY CAN COME TO OUR COUNTRY WE SHOULD BE DOING OUR PART
YOU0000004557_S0000939 THAT I VERY STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THOSE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WHO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE GOT TO TURN OUR BACKS ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO LEFT THEIR HOME WITH NOTHING
YOU0000004557_S0000948 HE SAYS THE WORLD HAS SEEN MANY GREAT LEADERS IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN HISTORY
YOU0000004557_S0000956 THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF
YOU0000004557_S0000962 YEAH IT IS
YOU0000004557_S0000967 WE ARE A NATION WHICH IF WE COME TOGETHER THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH
YOU0000004557_S0000972 IF WE REENGAGE AND GET INVOLVED
YOU0000004557_S0000977 AS THE FOREIGN LEADER
YOU0000004557_S0000983 ABOUT THE ROLE THAT HE PLAYED BOTH IN WAR AND IN PEACE ON THE ECONOMY AND DEFEATING FASCISM AROUND THE WORLD
YOU0000004557_S0000991 NOT ONLY THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS BUT THE ANTIPATHY OF THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS
YOU0000004557_S0000998 EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS A MONTH
YOU0000004557_S0001004 WE HAVE MADE ENORMOUS PROGRESS
YOU0000004557_S0001010 BUT I THINK TO SUGGEST THAT I HAVE VOICED CRITICISM THIS BLURB THAT YOU TALK ABOUT
YOU0000004557_S0001017 BUT I THINK IT IS REALLY UNFAIR TO SUGGEST THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE PRESIDENT
YOU0000004557_S0001029 ONE OF US RAN AGAINST BARACK OBAMA I WAS NOT THAT CANDIDATE
YOU0000004557_S0001036 WHO HAS THE CAPABILITY OR THE POWER TO TAKE ON WALL STREET
YOU0000004557_S0001042 WORKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN UP ON THE POLITICAL PROCESS
YOU0000004557_S0001051 I THINK THAT A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE TO OVERCOME TO BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT ARE HOLDING PEOPLE BACK
YOU0000004557_S0001059 ALL OF IT HAVE TOO MUCH INFLUENCE YOU'RE RIGHT
YOU0000004557_S0001065 SO I'M GOING TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT TEARING DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF AMERICANS FULFILLING THEIR POTENTIAL BECAUSE I DON'T THINK OUR COUNTRY CAN LIVE UP TO ITS POTENTIAL UNLESS WE GIVE A CHANCE TO EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN TO LIVE UP TO THEIRS

YOU0000004678_S0000265 WHAT IS YOUR MAIN FOCUS
YOU0000004678_S0000270 FINISH THE MOM'S MARKETING LOUNGE PROGRAM LIKE THAT IS IT
YOU0000004678_S0000279 IF YOU HAVE AN HOUR AND A HALF TO WORK ON YOU KNOW YOUR SIDE BUSINESS
YOU0000004678_S0000286 IF I SEE NOTIFICATIONS POP UP AND SOMETHING INTERESTS ME I KNOW ME I'M GONNA CLICK ON IT AND IT'S GONNA TAKE ME AWAY FROM IT
YOU0000004678_S0000301 BREAK IT UP
YOU0000004678_S0000315 SO THE NEXT TIME I KNEW THAT AND I WENT AND I SHUT OFF ALL OF THE SOUNDS ALL OF THE NOTIFICATIONS
YOU0000004678_S0000324 YES THAT'S A GOOD IDEA I'LL WRITE IT DOWN
YOU0000004678_S0000336 BUT THAT WOULD BE AN OPTION A PLACE FOR YOU TO HOUSE YOUR VIDEOS TOO WHERE IF YOU'VE STILL WANTED TO RUN IT WITH JUST A FACEBOOK GROUP

YOU0000004696_S0000029 THAT'S WHERE I COME IN SO IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH ME CLICK ON THE LINK BELOW AND I'LL BE TALKING WITH YOU SOON
YOU0000004704_S0000027 I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE AB TEST IS IF WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A GROWTH TEAM AT FACEBOOK
YOU0000004704_S0000032 THE NUMBER OF DAYS FROM ACQUISITION IS ON THE X AXIS
YOU0000004704_S0000037 BUT WHAT REALLY REALLY MATTERS IS THAT YOU GOT SKIN IN THE GAME AND PEOPLE COME BACK TO YOUR PRODUCT AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH
YOU0000004704_S0000046 I'D PREFER IF YOU DEFINED A MONTH AS TWENTY EIGHT DAYS BY THE WAY BECAUSE MULTIPLES OF SEVEN IS REALLY REALLY GOOD FOR THESE KIND OF METRICS BECAUSE OF WEEKS
YOU0000004704_S0000051 SO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THEM WERE ACTIVE ON DAY THIRTY ONE
YOU0000004704_S0000056 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T GET A HANDLE OF WHERE THINGS FLATTEN OUT VERY VERY EARLY ON WITH VERY SMALL NUMBERS OF USERS
YOU0000004704_S0000061 OR YOU NEED TO HAVE HAD ALL OF THOSE USERS ON FOR A VERY LONG TIME LOOK AT ADAM'S GRAPH IT WAS MULTIPLE YEARS WITH MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS
YOU0000004704_S0000066 NOT FLAT LINE LIKE A HEART MONITOR
YOU0000004704_S0000072 HOW MANY PEOPLE USE FARMVILLE NOW VERSUS HOW MANY PEOPLE USED FARMVILLE AT ITS ABSOLUTE PLEASE TELL ME YOU KNOW WHAT FARMVILLE IS
YOU0000004704_S0000082 THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAN CAUSE THAT RIGHT SO YOU HAVE THIS
YOU0000004704_S0000088 WHEN ALL YOUR FRIENDS GET ON TWITTER YOU'LL MORE LIKELY USE THE TWITTER WHATSAPP MESSENGER
YOU0000004704_S0000093 AND SO AS MARKETPLACES GO OFTEN WHAT YOU FIND IS THESE OLD COHORTS THAT SIGNED UP RESURRECT AND COME BACK TO THE SERVICE
YOU0000004704_S0000101 PEOPLE MIGHT'VE TRIED YOUR SERVICE ON A FRIEND'S IPHONE AND THEN WHEN YOU ADD AN ANDROID THEY COME BACK AND USE YOUR SERVICE
YOU0000004704_S0000109 BUT THEN TWO YEARS DOWN THE LINE AMAZON SUDDENLY HAD KITCHENWARE I DON'T KNOW
YOU0000004704_S0000115 MANY OF WHOM WERE EXISTING EBAY CUSTOMERS WHO NOW HAD ONE MORE CATEGORY THEY COULD SHOP IN
YOU0000004704_S0000123 BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU'RE IN ONE OF THOSE BUSINESSES
YOU0000004704_S0000128 FROM THIS FALLS OUT A BRILLIANT WAY TO LOOK AT GROWTH AND THIS GUY DANNY FERRANTE WHO WAS AT YAHOO WHO WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MEMBERS OF THE GROWTH TEAM RUNS CORE DATA SCIENCE AT FACEBOOK HE'S TOTALLY AWESOME
YOU0000004704_S0000136 WHEN WE CHANGE THE WAY WE LOOK AT THINGS TO SAY WELL OKAY THE NET GROWTH IS EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND A WEEK
YOU0000004704_S0000141 YOU'RE RESURRECTING ONE POINT ONE MILLION
YOU0000004704_S0000148 AND ONCE YOU START TO HAVE A BUSINESS WITH RETENTION
YOU0000004704_S0000155 WHATSAPP WHATEVER THE PRODUCT
YOU0000004704_S0000164 GETTING THAT FIRST PERSON RESERVE YOUR HOUSE
YOU0000004704_S0000173 OKAY YOU'RE KEEPING USING MY PRODUCT WHY YOU KEEPING USING MY WHAT IS THE THING THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY TO USE MY PRODUCT WHAT WAS THAT FIRST MOMENT
YOU0000004704_S0000180 NO IT'S CLEARLY A SMOOTH CURVE AND WE PICKED A POINT ON THE CURVE
YOU0000004704_S0000189 I LOVE THIS
YOU0000004704_S0000199 AND YOU HAVE FIVE OR TEN PERCENT RETENTION BUT THOSE PEOPLE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY YOU HAVE A TOTALLY VIABLE BUSINESS
YOU0000004704_S0000207 BUT THEY WEREN'T RELEASING THE ACTUAL POWER BECAUSE THAT WAS A CLOSELY GUARDED STATE SECRET
YOU0000004704_S0000215 THE TIME IS ON HERE
YOU0000004704_S0000220 AND IT TURNS OUT THE BOMB WAS TWENTY ONE KILOTONS AS MEASURED BY THE US GOVERNMENT
YOU0000004704_S0000229 SO THE THING HAS ONLY BEEN AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS SO ZERO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ADVERTISERS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE DAYS AGO
YOU0000004704_S0000241 THE REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS I WANT YOU TO TAKE AWAY FROM LOOKING AT THIS CURVE IS
YOU0000004704_S0000246 I'VE SEEN THIS OVER AND OVER I'VE SEEN THIS WITH ENGAGEMENT
YOU0000004704_S0000251 I HAVE SEEN IT FOR PHOTOS UPLOADED MESSAGES SENT
YOU0000004704_S0000259 THE SAME METHODOLOGY WORKS FOR ENGAGEMENT
YOU0000004704_S0000265 AND THIS WAS FIVE YEARS BEFORE THAT
YOU0000004704_S0000272 HE ALWAYS SAYS
YOU0000004704_S0000277 BUT THE BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT REASON IS I THINK IT ALIGNS EVERYONE
YOU0000004704_S0000283 SO LET'S THINK BACK TO THE EARLY DAYS OF ANY COMPANY
YOU0000004704_S0000289 YOU WANT TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY THAT YOUR COMPANY CAN STILL BE VIABLE THAT YOU CAN EMPLOY PEOPLE THAT VALUATION GOES UP
YOU0000004704_S0000294 I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS COMPANY'S METRICS ARE BEYOND FACEBOOK'S
YOU0000004704_S0000300 TWO ARE LOOKING AT TIME SPENT AND TWO ARE LOOKING AT NUMBER OF POSTS
YOU0000004704_S0000309 BUT FUNDAMENTALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS PICK A GOAL
YOU0000004704_S0000315 DON'T HAVE A GROWTH TEAM DON'T HIRE SOMEONE LIKE ME
YOU0000004704_S0000322 SHE'S BEEN AT FACEBOOK TWELVE YEARS
YOU0000004704_S0000328 ASK YOUR USERS WHAT THEY THINK
YOU0000004704_S0000334 LOOK THROUGH ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT METRICS
YOU0000004704_S0000342 AND THEN TRY AND DOUBLE DOWN ON FIXING THOSE GAPS IN THE EXECUTION PHASE NOW TO THIS DAY THIS IS STILL HOW WE RUN GROWTH AT FACEBOOK AND YOU CAN EVEN SEE A A TALK NAOMI AND I GAVE ONLINE
YOU0000004704_S0000348 AND YOUR INTUITION IS GOING TO RUN OUT AT SOME POINT AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO WANT DATA
YOU0000004704_S0000358 GET THE DATA LOGGED SO YOU CAN RUN THROUGH THIS PROCESS
YOU0000004704_S0000364 I LIKE TO SAY THESE THREE POINTS
YOU0000004704_S0000373 BUT IF YOU WENT TO THE PHILIPPINES WHERE THERE WAS HUGE USAGE IN INTERNET CAFES AND PEOPLE RUN NARROW SCREENS
YOU0000004704_S0000380 NOW THINK ABOUT IT I PRESUME I DON'T KNOW I'M SEEING A LOT OF APPLE PRODUCTS HERE
YOU0000004704_S0000389 BUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND ANDROID AND IOS WELL AS A USER AT THE SAME TIME
YOU0000004704_S0000397 IF YOUR RESEARCH ACTUALLY TIES UP WITH WHAT YOUR USERS HAVE SAID TO YOU SO DATA GIVES YOU EMPATHY
YOU0000004704_S0000404 THOSE CURVES THAT SHOW YOU THE RETENTION
YOU0000004704_S0000410 YOU SEE SOMEONE SIGN UP
YOU0000004704_S0000416 THEY SHIP THE THING THAT LOOKED BAD IN THE AB TEST BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THE AB TEST
YOU0000004704_S0000422 HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION OVER SOMETHING WHERE YOU COULD JUST RUN A TEST
YOU0000004704_S0000428 MAKE SENSE
YOU0000004704_S0000439 RESEARCH AND THEN REACH OUT TO WHO YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE AS YOUR USERS
YOU0000004704_S0000451 BECAUSE THEY HAVE THESE OTHER METRICS BUT YOU CAN GET THESE GREAT ONE-TIME BUMPS JUST KNOW YOU CAN'T GET THEM EVERY SINGLE WEEK AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE A ONE OFF
YOU0000004704_S0000458 YOU NEED TO HAVE PRODUCT MARKET FIT TO DRIVE GROWTH
YOU0000004704_S0000468 I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S NOT TRUE BUT IT'S NOT BEEN TRUE IN MY EXPERIENCE
YOU0000004704_S0000478 BIG COMPANIES
YOU0000004704_S0000486 AND THEN AGAIN
YOU0000004704_S0000498 IF YOU GIVE THEM THE OPTIONS THEY KNOW HOW TO TURN OFF NOTIFICATIONS
YOU0000004704_S0000505 PEOPLE GET WRONG
YOU0000004704_S0000512 SO THINK ABOUT ON SITE MERCHANDISING YOU OWN A LOT OF MEDIA THERE'S THIS IDEA OF EARNED BOUGHT AND OWNED MEDIA DOES THAT MAKE SENSE
YOU0000004704_S0000518 IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF TRAFFIC ON YOUR SITE
YOU0000004704_S0000526 WORKS INCREDIBLY WELL
YOU0000004704_S0000534 THIS PERSON
YOU0000004704_S0000540 WE SHOW YOU WHAT YOUR AD WOULD LOOK LIKE IF YOU BOUGHT IT
YOU0000004704_S0000545 BUT WHAT I'LL SAY IS IF I LEFT FACEBOOK TODAY AND I WAS A START-UP I WOULD BE CRAZY NOT TO USE OUR CUSTOM AUDIENCES AND LOOK-ALIKE TARGETING
YOU0000004704_S0000550 BECAUSE THE CLICK-THROUGH RATE ON YOUR THING
YOU0000004704_S0000556 OKAY
YOU0000004704_S0000564 MEN'S NIKE TRAINERS TYPICALLY ARE MEN
YOU0000004704_S0000572 PROBABLY IT'S VERY VERY WORTH IT BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T PRODUCE A PIECE OF CREATIVE THAT AMAZING THAT CHANGES THE WORLD
YOU0000004704_S0000578 WHERE ON EVERY AD BACK IN THE DAY ON FACEBOOK WE HAD A LITTLE LINK AT THE TOP THAT SAID ADVERTISE
YOU0000004704_S0000585 AND WE ACHIEVED A FORTY PERCENT BUMP IN THAT MOST IMPORTANT CHANNEL FOR US FOR ADVERTISER ACQUISITION
YOU0000004704_S0000594 AND THEN THE LAST THING
YOU0000004704_S0000599 THE LANDING PAGE PEOPLE LAND ON WILL DETERMINE WHAT YOUR CONVERSION RATE IS GOING TO BE
YOU0000004704_S0000604 BACK AT EBAY WHAT WE HAD WAS THIS ORIGINAL METRIC CONFIRMED REGISTERED USERS AND A NEW METRIC ACTIVATED CONFIRMED REGISTERED USERS
YOU0000004704_S0000610 SO IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A TRAMPOLINE
YOU0000004704_S0000616 IT INCREASED REVENUE AND LIFETIME VALUE PER REGISTERED USER
YOU0000004704_S0000621 SO IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS JUST PUT THE REGISTRATION FORM ONLINE
YOU0000004704_S0000628 WE'RE WILLING TO MOVE FAST WE'RE WILLING TO BE BOLD BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALLY A GOOD PLAN VIOLENTLY EXECUTED ON TODAY IS BETTER THAN A PERFECT PLAN NEXT WEEK
YOU0000004704_S0000633 SO MOVE FAST
YOU0000004712_S0000006 ARCH-NEMESIS MORIARTY

YOU0000004746_S0000038 LETTERS ALLEGEDLY WRITTEN BY JAPANESE CITIZENS WERE ADMITTED WITH NO PROOF OF AUTHENTICITY AND NO OPPORTUNITY FOR CROSS EXAMINATION BY THE DEFENSE THE TRIBUNAL EMBRACED THE BEST EVIDENCE RULE ONCE THE PROSECUTION HAD RESTED

YOU0000004746_S0000089 O F COURSE IN JAPAN WE WERE ALL AWARE OF THE BOMBINGS AND THE BURNINGS OF TOKYO AND YOKOHAMA AND OTHER BIG CITIES

YOU0000004746_S0000106 THE TRUMAN ADMINISTRATION AND GENERAL MACARTHUR BOTH BELIEVED THE OCCUPATION REFORMS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED SMOOTHLY IF THEY USED HIROHITO TO LEGITIMISE THEIR CHANGES

YOU0000004846_S0001326 AND SO I LOOK AT IT IN A SENSE THAT IT'S GONNA GIVE FOLKS MORE OF A VOICE
YOU0000004846_S0001334 IF THAT HAD BEEN ON THE AGENDA SHE WOULD'VE HAD ANOTHER THREE MINUTES TO SPEAK ON THAT SPECIFIC TOPIC AND SO
YOU0000004846_S0001349 NOT LIMIT THEM TO SPEAK
YOU0000004846_S0001389 SO WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE MERCY MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT'S A HUGE DOCUMENT
YOU0000004846_S0001413 MR CHAIRMAN I MAKE A MOTION THAT WE
YOU0000004846_S0001431 AND WE WANNA START THIS WAY AND GO AROUND
YOU0000004846_S0001439 AND
YOU0000004846_S0001458 I WOULD JUST LIKE TO BE A PART OF THAT CONVERSATION BEFORE THERE'S NO POINT TO PROVIDE INPUT BECAUSE THE CAKE HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN OUT THE STREAMERS ARE ALREADY HUNG AND THE BALLOONS ARE ALREADY INFLATED
YOU0000004846_S0001474 WHEN YOU HAVE
YOU0000004846_S0001489 CAME TO US AND WAS INTERVIEWED
YOU0000004846_S0001503 BUT YES I WILL
YOU0000004846_S0001513 AND UNFORTUNATELY WHAT I HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS THIS
YOU0000004846_S0001520 WHEN I CAME TO VOLUSIA COUNTY SCHOOLS SHORTY THEREAFTER
YOU0000004846_S0001525 BUT WHAT A LEGACY SHE LEFT BEHIND
YOU0000004846_S0001533 OKAY
YOU0000004846_S0001545 THE BALLOTS WILL BE MAILED OUT YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM BY MAY FIRST
YOU0000004846_S0001551 THAT WE DON'T HIRE

YOU0000004846_S0001562 WENT THROUGH THE TRAINING AND HAVE NEVER BEEN AN ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR A POSITION AS WELL
YOU0000004846_S0001571 YOU'RE EITHER DEMOTED OR TERMINATED IT
YOU0000004846_S0001583 AND SOMETIMES
YOU0000004846_S0001588 A NEED TO HAVE A CHANGE IN PRINCIPALS

YOU0000004854_S0000027 WHAT SHE MAY BE WEIGHING
YOU0000004854_S0000076 BUT NOW THAT THEY HAVE HEARD ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO GET TO THE FULL TRUTH AND THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT
YOU0000004854_S0000103 THIS DISPUTE ABOUT MATERIAL FACTS WEIGHS IN FAVOR OF CALLING ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WITH DIRECT KNOWLEDGE
YOU0000004854_S0000110 BECAUSE WHATEVER IS ACCEPTED IN THIS CASE BECOMES THE NEW NORMAL FOR EVERY IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING IN THE FUTURE
YOU0000004854_S0000124 THEY POINT OUT THERE HAVE BEEN WITNESSES IN THE PAST
YOU0000004854_S0000160 HE SAYS THEY PROVED THEIR CASE AND HE SAYS THAT MORE THAN ONCE
YOU0000004854_S0000191 HE IS LIKELY TO TAKE THIS AS A TOTAL EXONERATION
YOU0000004854_S0000213 HOW CAN WE LEAVE IT TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IF THE PEOPLE'S WILL MIGHT BE INTERFERED WITH OR CHANGE IT IN THE PROCESS
YOU0000004854_S0000275 OUR COLLEAGUE ROBERT BARNES WHO COVERS THE SUPREME COURT SO APTLY DESCRIBED HIM AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER TAKING THAT SORT OF A ROLE
YOU0000004854_S0000297 SO
YOU0000004854_S0000351 BUT COULDN'T BE MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT
YOU0000004854_S0000397 YOU CANNOT HAVE A TRUE ACQUITTAL IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD A FAIR TRIAL
YOU0000004854_S0000402 THE ONLY ATTRIBUTES OF A FAIR TRIAL IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE ARE WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS EVIDENCE
YOU0000004854_S0000420 WE'RE ALREADY SEEING DEMOCRATS SAY
YOU0000004854_S0000429 AND IT
YOU0000004854_S0000472 DO WE HAVE ACQUITTAL TODAY
YOU0000004854_S0000518 I MEAN
YOU0000004854_S0000540 COURT OF IMPEACHMENT THE CHAPLAIN WILL LEAD US IN PRAYER
YOU0000004854_S0000545 DO FOR OTHERS WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE THEM TO DO FOR YOU
YOU0000004854_S0000550 FOR WE ALWAYS REAP WHAT WE SOW

YOU0000004854_S0000597 JUST AS WE
YOU0000004854_S0000605 MR BOLTON UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS WRONG
YOU0000004854_S0000617 I NEVER INSTRUCTED JOHN BOLTON TO SET UP A MEETING FOR RUDY GIULIANI
YOU0000004854_S0000624 LET'S NOT FEAR WHAT WE WILL LEARN
YOU0000004854_S0000632 THIS BODY DECIDED TO HOLD THE QUESTION OVER
YOU0000004854_S0000639 IT IS SUFFICIENT TO CONVICT THE PRESIDENT ON BOTH ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT MORE THAN SUFFICIENT
YOU0000004854_S0000645 THE COMMON SENSE PRACTICE IS BOURNE OUT OF PRECEDENT
YOU0000004854_S0000651 NOW I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS ONE QUESTION AT THE OFF SET
YOU0000004854_S0000658 IN THE NEXT ELECTION
YOU0000004854_S0000664 WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO CALL WITNESSES AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTS THE ANSWER IS CLEARLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY NO
YOU0000004854_S0001216 TRUMP TOLD BOLTON TO HELP HIS UKRAINE PRESSURE CAMPAIGN
YOU0000004854_S0001225 WHO IS NOW LEADING THE PRESIDENT'S IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE

YOU0000004862_S0000022 ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR VOLUMES OF BURIAL REGISTERS WERE SHIPPED FROM THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES IN DC TO ANCESTRY'S OFFICE IN SILVER SPRING MARYLAND
YOU0000004862_S0000037 THE HISTORIC PRESERVATION OF THESE PRICELESS BURIAL LEDGERS IS PART OF THE NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION'S CELEBRATION OF THE CIVIL WAR SESQUICENTENNIAL
YOU0000004862_S0000046 FOR EXAMPLE WHEN ARMY SERGEANT MARC OWENS ARRIVED HERE FROM A MILITARY MEDICAL CENTER

YOU0000004990_S0000010 OR WHAT HAVE YOU
YOU0000004990_S0000021 AND SO MY HUSBAND AND I WEREN'T ON THE SAME PAGE AND WE EVENTUALLY GOT DIVORCED
YOU0000004990_S0000039 AFTER COMING FROM NOT HAVING MUCH OF ANYTHING GROWING UP YOU JUST NEVER KNOW HOW FAR YOU CAN GO YOU CAN BUILD AND LIKE YOU CAN MAKE MORE
YOU0000004998_S0000004 FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT WHERE AND WHEN
YOU0000004998_S0000009 STILL BOTH PROKARYOTIC AND EUKARYOTIC CELLS DO DNA REPLICATIONM BUT THERE'S SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO THAT THIS CLIP DOESN'T GO INTO
YOU0000004998_S0000014 I THINK DNA REPLICATION WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE A GREAT VIDEO GAME
YOU0000004998_S0000022 SO HERE WE GO WITH THE KEY PLAYERS
YOU0000004998_S0000028 THIS ENZYME REPLICATES DNA MOLECULES TO ACTUALLY BUILD A NEW STRAND OF DNA
YOU0000004998_S0000034 IT HELPS GLUE DNA FRAGMENTS TOGETHER MORE ABOUT WHY YOU WOULD NEED THAT LATER ON
YOU0000004998_S0000042 AND TOPOISOMERASE I ALWAYS HAVE TO SLOW DOWN WHEN I SAY THAT ENZYME'S NAME KEEPS THE DNA FROM SUPERCOILING
YOU0000004998_S0000049 OK BEFORE WE GO ON REMEMBER HOW WE SAID DNA HAS TWO STRANDS
YOU0000004998_S0000056 THE SUGAR OF DNA IS PART OF THE BACKBONE OF DNA
YOU0000004998_S0000065 IN THIS EXAMPLE IT WILL KEEP UNWINDING IN THIS DIRECTION
YOU0000004998_S0000075 IT HAS TO KEEP RACING UP HERE NEXT TO WHERE THIS UNWINDING IS HAPPENING
YOU0000004998_S0000082 ONE LAST THING
YOU0000004998_S0000088 SO REMEMBER HOW WE SAID THERE IS FAR MORE DETAIL TO THIS PROCESS TO EXPLORE
YOU0000005006_S0000009 THIS ONE
YOU0000005006_S0000024 AND THE MORE LIGHT WILL PASS THROUGH THE LENS
YOU0000005006_S0000030 IN MY OPINION YOU SHOULDN'T FILM IN MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED ISO
YOU0000005006_S0000037 THE LARGER THE APERTURE IS
YOU0000005006_S0000044 JUST BY DOING THESE SIMPLE STEPS YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE A MUCH BETTER SHOT
YOU0000005006_S0000052 YOU CAN CHANGE TO A FASTER LENS
YOU0000005006_S0000060 BUT REMEMBER THAT IT MAKES IT HARD TO FOCUS ON THE SUBJECT
YOU0000005006_S0000069 DON'T BOUNCE TO MUCH LIGHT OR ELSE THE LIGHT ON HIS FACE WILL GET TOO FLAT AND BORING
YOU0000005006_S0000076 CLOSED THE CURTAIN A BIT TO MAKE THE BACKGROUND EVEN DARKER
YOU0000005006_S0000082 THEREFORE IT'S CALLED KEYLIGHT

YOU0000005014_S0000052 WE HAVE RELATIVELY LOW ECONOMIC GROWTH IT'S BEEN BUMBLING ALONG AT AROUND ABOUT TWO PER CENT
YOU0000005014_S0000067 HEY ALBO CHRIS BOWEN TODAY SAID THAT PEOPLE OF FAITH NO LONGER FEEL THAT PROGRESSIVE POLITICS CARES ABOUT THEM
YOU0000005022_S0000010 STEROIDS ALSO DECREASED NATURAL PRODUCTION OF HORMONES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR MAINTAINING TESTICULAR SIZE
YOU0000005030_S0000008 BUT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BUILD A CHANNEL OF YOUR OWN I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO SHARE THE STORY BEHIND THIS CHANNEL APPLE EXPLAINED SO YOU CAN GET A PEEK BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GROW A YOUTUBE CHANNEL FROM THE CREATORS PERSPECTIVE
YOU0000005030_S0000013 AND MY OBSESSION WITH APPLE ONLY GREW FROM THERE
YOU0000005030_S0000023 THE ONLY REASON WHY I POSTED A VIDEO IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS BECAUSE I WANTED TO WATCH A CERTAIN TYPE OF VIDEO ABOUT APPLE BUT COULDN'T FIND ANYONE MAKING IT SO I DECIDED TO MAKE IT MYSELF
YOU0000005030_S0000031 AND YOU MIGHT ASSUME THAT THIS EXCITED ME SO MUCH THAT I BEGAN UPLOADING VIDEOS REGULARLY
YOU0000005030_S0000040 SO ANOTHER TWO YEARS PAST AND I DECIDED TO START WORKING ON MY FIFTH VIDEO HISTORY OF THE IPHONE
YOU0000005030_S0000049 AND THIS IS WHEN I REALIZED I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GROW MY TINY CHANNEL TO A RESPECTABLE SIZE SOMEDAY
YOU0000005030_S0000055 I QUICKLY FOUND OUT WHAT HELPED CONTRIBUTE TO MY CHANNEL'S GROWTH AND WHAT DID NOT
YOU0000005030_S0000062 SO I RETURNED TO MAKING MY USUAL KEYNOTE SLIDESHOW VIDEOS WHERE I SHOWED EVERY MODEL OF A CERTAIN APPLE PRODUCT
YOU0000005030_S0000068 BECAUSE I COULD MAKE THOSE VIDEOS MUCH QUICKER THAN MY USUAL SLIDESHOWS
YOU0000005030_S0000073 AND THAT LED TO YOUTUBE RECOMMENDING MY VIDEOS EVEN MORE
YOU0000005030_S0000079 SO I AM A HUGE BELIEVER THAT YOU SHOULD ONLY UPLOAD MORE OFTEN IF THE VIDEOS YOU'RE MAKING ARE ACTUALLY ENTERTAINING TO PEOPLE
YOU0000005030_S0000085 YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS
YOU0000005030_S0000095 LOOKING BACK AT HOW FAR THIS CHANNEL HAS COME REALLY MAKES ME APPRECIATE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT ALL POSSIBLE

YOU0000005054_S0000047 A MAN NAMED DANDIN WHO LIVED IN AROUND THE SEVENTH CENTURY
YOU0000005054_S0000055 BUT THERE IS A KEY DIFFERENCE THAT I'LL INTRODUCE LATER
YOU0000005054_S0000060 THIS LECTURE
YOU0000005054_S0000068 SO BY PAYING ATTENTION TO POETRY AS SOMETHING OF A CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICE
YOU0000005054_S0000078 OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BOOKCASES OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH WRITING THAT THEY KNOW THEY'RE COMING TO A PLACE WHERE BUDDHIST MONKS ARE
YOU0000005054_S0000087 WHAT DID IT MEAN WHEN THE BUDDHA SAID THAT HE COULD REMEMBER HIS PREVIOUS LIVES WHAT WAS HE DOING DID HE REMEMBER WHAT HE HAD FOR LUNCH EVERY SINGLE DAY IN ALL THOSE PREVIOUS LIVES
YOU0000005054_S0000101 OH WHAT MONKS LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY'RE STUDYING

YOU0000005054_S0000141 THAT BUDDHIST POETRY IS PART OF WHAT WE CAN SAY THE CONTOURS OF A BUDDHIST LIFE
YOU0000005054_S0000149 GREAT BUDDHIST THINKERS ARE REMEMBERED AS ALSO BEING POETS
YOU0000005054_S0000154 WAS AN EXCELLENT POET

YOU0000005054_S0000196 AND EVEN THOUGH HE SAYS I SALUTE YOU
YOU0000005054_S0000211 HACK CAN DO SOMETHING PERFECT
YOU0000005054_S0000217 THE MOST FAMOUS VERSES IN BUDDHIST LITERATURE THAT ECHOES ACROSS THE BUDDHIST WORLD IS THAT THE
YOU0000005054_S0000222 VERSE IS THE ANSWER OF A BUDDHA OF THE BUDDHA TO A QUESTION THAT IS PUT TO HIM IN A VERSE
YOU0000005054_S0000229 A TANGLE OUTSIDE
YOU0000005054_S0000237 THEY ARE SAYING OH THIS IS SOMETHING METAPHORICAL

YOU0000005054_S0000276 HE'S NOT ONE WE KNOW HISTORICALLY AND THERE'S A KIND OF INTERESTING FEATURE ABOUT
YOU0000005054_S0000281 IT'S USED IN RITUALS
YOU0000005054_S0000287 AND SO THIS WE HAVE A HISTORICAL QUESTION
YOU0000005054_S0000294 IT MAKES SOMETHING BITTER GO DOWN THE THROAT
YOU0000005054_S0000304 THAT IS PRODUCED BY ELITES
YOU0000005054_S0000314 SO IN THE GREATEST ONE IN PALI OF THE THERAVADA WORLD

YOU0000005054_S0000453 THE LAST TYPE IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING
YOU0000005054_S0000459 AND THE TAWNY TOUCH ON THOSE MATTED LOCKS
YOU0000005054_S0000469 ACADEMIC DISCOURSE TODAY SINGULARITY IS A MAJOR CONCEPT
YOU0000005054_S0000477 SOMETIMES YOU CHANGE WHAT YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO
YOU0000005054_S0000484 IT'S NOT SAYING THINGS DIRECTLY
YOU0000005054_S0000492 BUT IT'S ACTUALLY CREATING SOMETHING
YOU0000005054_S0000502 THAT IS
YOU0000005054_S0000508 BUT MY MIND'S EYE CAN SEE IT
YOU0000005054_S0000519 EVEN THOUGH HE WELL
YOU0000005054_S0000527 HIS PROMINENCE WAS THAT
YOU0000005054_S0000537 BUT HE HAS TO TELL THE CLOUD HOW TO GET THERE
YOU0000005054_S0000548 WHEN YOU'RE DESPERATE YOU TRY ANYTHING
YOU0000005054_S0000556 AND SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS HAPPENING
YOU0000005054_S0000564 IPHONES NO INTERNET NO ONE KNEW IF YOU WERE STILL ALIVE

YOU0000005054_S0000688 EVEN HAVING BEEN TO THAT EXACT PLACE IN PERSON
YOU0000005054_S0000695 BUT IF WE VISUALIZE WITH OUR MIND'S EYE
YOU0000005054_S0000705 YOU CAN INTERPRET THE DIFFERENT PARTS
YOU0000005054_S0000712 AND SOME PEOPLE WRAP THEMSELVES IN GARMENTS IN ACTIONS THAT ARE REFLECTING SOMETHING OF THE QUALITIES OF
YOU0000005054_S0000721 JUST THE WAY THAT THE FAIRY DUST
YOU0000005054_S0000757 AS YOU SEE SORT OF COMMON DEVELOPMENT IN SALVATION
YOU0000005054_S0000783 HOW DO YOU MAKE YOUR BODY
YOU0000005054_S0000793 WHAT WE THINK OF AS MEDITATION IS A DISCIPLINE OF THE MIND
YOU0000005054_S0000798 TO SEE WHAT IT PRODUCES
YOU0000005054_S0000809 RECOMMENDATIONS
YOU0000005054_S0000831 THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED THING
YOU0000005054_S0000859 PEOPLE SAY YES SOME PEOPLE SAY
YOU0000005054_S0000868 AND SO THEN WHAT YOU HAVE IS AN IDEA THAT THE WORLD IS KIND OF UNDERDETERMINED IN ITS APPEARANCES
YOU0000005054_S0000875 GETS LOST IN TRUTH
YOU0000005054_S0000929 WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING FROM THE OUTSIDE
YOU0000005054_S0000945 NEVER REALLY

YOU0000005094_S0000242 AND YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE MODEL AND YOU CAN JUST PLUG IT INTO A THREE D PRINTER AND HAVE IT SPIT OUT OR YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT INTO GOOGLE SKETCHUP OR ONE OF THOSE OTHER THREE D PROGRAMS AND CHANGE IT SO THAT THE EYEGLASSES HAVE A DIFFERENT SHAPE OR THE VISE IS TWICE AS BIG
YOU0000005094_S0000257 AND THEY SAID OK ONE HUNDRED MOTORS CUSTOM MOTORS
YOU0000005094_S0000275 THIS CIRCUIT BOARD WAS MILLED OUT WITH SOMETHING CALLED THE OTHERMILL
YOU0000005094_S0000284 VIBRATION
YOU0000005094_S0000294 AND SO WHAT HE DID HE GAVE IT TO SOME FRIENDS WHO WERE GETTING MARRIED
YOU0000005094_S0000302 A GPS UNIT
YOU0000005094_S0000321 WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE SOLID
YOU0000005094_S0000332 MAKING THINGS DESIGNING THINGS IS AN ITERATIVE PROCESS
YOU0000005094_S0000348 AND THEN FUNDING
YOU0000005094_S0000365 AND I'M LIKE QUINN
YOU0000005094_S0000377 YOU CAN HAVE SOMETHING LIKE
YOU0000005094_S0000390 THEY MAKE THIS KIND OF CHASSIS HERE AND THEN YOU CAN PUT ANY KIND OF CUSTOM BODY ON IT THAT YOU WANT
YOU0000005094_S0000404 AND SO AS PEOPLE DRIVE AROUND
YOU0000005094_S0000418 THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
YOU0000005094_S0000495 AND THEN TO ENFORCE IT IS HARD
YOU0000005094_S0000505 I THINK
YOU0000005094_S0000515 AT LEAST THERE'S A BIG ENOUGH ECOSYSTEM THAT PEOPLE WILL BUY ENOUGH OF THE ORIGINAL THAT THEY CAN STAY IN BUSINESS
YOU0000005094_S0000528 BRING LIKE A GREAT GUEST INTO A CONVENTION OR MAKE A BEAUTIFUL ZINE OR DO SOMETHING SPECIAL
YOU0000005094_S0000539 I'M ALSO FROM CORNELL TECH I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT YOU'RE HERE
YOU0000005094_S0000559 THEY HAVE PEOPLE WHO MAKE REALLY COOL KITES
YOU0000005094_S0000565 THAT'S EVERY FALL
YOU0000005094_S0000594 SO THAT'S A GOOD THING
YOU0000005094_S0000601 AND THEN THEY'LL HAVE AN IDEA AND THINK
YOU0000005094_S0000620 IS THERE ONE MORE QUESTION UPFRONT OK
YOU0000005094_S0000649 AND PLEASE
YOU0000005102_S0000032 AND ALSO THE SERVER SIDE PERFORMANCE IS UNUSUALLY GOOD EVEN AMONG THE POPULAR TOOLS FOR BUILDING WEB APPLICATIONS THAT YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HEARD OF BEFORE
YOU0000005102_S0000047 AND THE PERFORMANCE IS ALSO VERY GOOD
YOU0000005102_S0000066 THIS WEB SERVER MIGHT ALSO BE TALKING TO A DATABASE THAT PROVIDES A PERSISTENT STORE THAT IS SHARED ACROSS ALL THE USERS OF THE APPLICATION
YOU0000005102_S0000082 HAVING READ THE PAPER
YOU0000005102_S0000089 YOU GET CODE INJECTION ATTACKS
YOU0000005102_S0000103 AND THAT IS HOW THE PROGRAM MANIPULATES IT NOT AS A STRING
YOU0000005102_S0000112 AND UR WEB ADOPTS THAT MODEL AND BUILDS IT INTO THE SEMANTICS OF THE LANGUAGE
YOU0000005102_S0000119 UR WEB WILL DETECT WHEN A TRANSACTION FAILS BECAUSE OF A CONCURRENCY PROBLEM LIKE A DEADLOCK AND AUTOMATICALLY RESTART THE TRANSACTION
YOU0000005102_S0000128 RESTART A TRANSACTION
YOU0000005102_S0000149 THAT SOUNDS POSSIBLE IN PRINCIPLE
YOU0000005102_S0000308 AND ONLY ALLOW THINGS THAT FALL IN YOUR
YOU0000005102_S0000321 AND TWO
YOU0000005102_S0000335 SO HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF SQL SYNTAX EMBEDDED INSIDE OF UR WEB
YOU0000005102_S0000346 SO IN THE USUAL WAY OF TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS ESCAPING HAPPENS IN THE WAY YOU'D WANT IT TO
YOU0000005102_S0000358 AND HERE'S WHAT IT IS
YOU0000005102_S0000380 IT'S BASICALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A WAY TO GET ENFORCED ENCAPSULATION OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF AN APPLICATION THAT UR WEB SUPPORTS WHICH IS AT LEAST ONLY RARELY SUPPORTED ELSEWHERE
YOU0000005102_S0000388 AND THE ONLY WAY THE OUTSIDE WORLD CAN EVER USE ONE IS TO CALL THE CHAT FUNCTION ON IT
YOU0000005102_S0000401 SOMETHING GOOFY
YOU0000005102_S0000460 CONVERT IT INTO THIS TYPE
YOU0000005102_S0000469 AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A COOKIE SO COOKIES ARE ANOTHER THING THAT'S BUILT INTO THE LANGUAGE
YOU0000005102_S0000487 WE CAN CREATE THIS FUNCTION THAT TELLS WHO THE USER IS LOGGED IN AS BY GETTING THE CURRENT COOKIE VALUE
YOU0000005102_S0000494 IF IT WORKED THEN WE'LL JUST RETURN THE ID PART OF THE RECORD THAT WE JUST VERIFIED AGAINST THE DATABASE
YOU0000005102_S0000567 INTO DEMO ROOM SPEAK
YOU0000005102_S0000599 AND TO SOME EXTEND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLEMENTATIONS OF SOME OF THESE ABSTRACTIONS TO AVOID DISTURBING THEM
YOU0000005102_S0000623 PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT
YOU0000005110_S0000009 SO WE'RE GOING TO AND DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE THE PETITIONER OR THE RESPONDENT I'M SPEAKING TO ALL OF YOU NOW
YOU0000005110_S0000014 SO THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE GET TRIPPED UP
YOU0000005110_S0000020 MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY BI-WEEKLY SO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
YOU0000005110_S0000025 THAT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE IN WHAT YOUR OVERALL INCOME IS IF YOU'RE PAID TWENTY FOUR TIMES OR TWENTY SIX TIMES SO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
YOU0000005110_S0000031 MOST OF YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL OVERWHELMED AND HAVE A HEADACHE AND HATE THIS FORM BY THE TIME YOU'RE DONE WITH IT
YOU0000005110_S0000040 NUMBER TWO YOUR AGE AND EDUCATION THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GONNA LIST YOUR CURRENT AGE YOU'RE GONNA PUT YOUR DEGREES HAVE YOU COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL
YOU0000005110_S0000051 I CLAIM THE NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS ON MY TAXES OKAY THIS IS WHERE YOU DON'T WANNA LOOK AT YOUR PAYCHECK STUB A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE THE EXEMPTIONS THEY CLAIM OFF OF THEIR PAYCHECK STUB AND THEY PUT THAT DOWN THERE THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE ASKING
YOU0000005110_S0000059 NUMBER FOUR OTHER PARTY'S INCOME
YOU0000005110_S0000065 THE ONLY THING YOU'RE ASKING IS WHAT DO YOU THINK THE INCOME IS SO YOU NEED TO PUT A REASONABLE ESTIMATE LET'S SAY THEY HAVE A FULL-TIME JOB AND THEY'VE GOT SIDE WORK
YOU0000005110_S0000076 IF YOU'RE BI-WEEKLY
YOU0000005110_S0000090 OR
YOU0000005110_S0000096 DO HAVE UNION DUES
YOU0000005110_S0000104 AND THERE'S SOME OTHER QUESTIONS THERE THAT DON'T APPLY TO EVERYBODY
YOU0000005110_S0000111 SO THE FIRST BOX YOU'RE GONNA LIST EVERYBODY THAT LIVES WITH YOU THEIR AGE THEIR RELATIONSHIP
YOU0000005110_S0000120 AND JUST VERY BRIEFLY HEALTHCARE COSTS NOT PAID BY INSURANCE THAT'S FOR YOUR HOUSEHOLDS THAT'S YOUR KIDS
YOU0000005110_S0000130 OKAY SO GOING DOWN TO NUMBER FOURTEEN
YOU0000005110_S0000137 AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA SAY THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME THEY SPEND WITH JAMIE AND DALE
YOU0000005110_S0000142 THE COURT NEEDS TO KNOW

YOU0000005126_S0000627 THE HOW LONG THAT WILL TAKE TO ISSUE WILL OF COURSE DEPEND ON THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSAL IF IT'S JUST TABLES AND CHAIRS
YOU0000005126_S0000639 AND OTHER SAFETY PROTOCOLS
YOU0000005126_S0000646 WE'VE ALREADY HAD DEVELOPED

YOU0000005126_S0000727 I DIDN'T BRING THAT WITH ME
YOU0000005126_S0000744 THE LAST THING I WOULD ADD THAT IT WILL BE REALLY HELPFUL IF OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT DID SOME OUTREACH WITH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS SIMPLE PROCESS
YOU0000005126_S0000755 I THINK THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT HAS DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB OF ACCOMMODATING AND ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THIS UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WE'RE IN TODAY SO I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT
YOU0000005126_S0000765 AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THINGS CAN BE SELF-CERTIFIED
YOU0000005126_S0000774 JUST KNOWING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN BE FLEXIBLE DURING THIS EMERGENCY TO ENSURE THAT THESE LOCAL BUSINESSES NOT ONLY STAY IN BUSINESS BUT ALSO THEY'RE DOING THIS IN ORDER TO ENSURE GREATER SAFETY FOR THE COMMUNITY SO IT NEEDS TO BALANCE IN BOTH NEEDS

YOU0000005126_S0000843 ABOUT HOW THEY REALLY DON'T OFFER PROTECTION
YOU0000005126_S0000849 WHICH IS SOMETHING HAZARDOUS
YOU0000005126_S0000858 I'M MONICA MCGUIRE FROM CORRALITOS AGAIN
YOU0000005126_S0000866 AS OPPOSED TO ONLY ONE IS LUDICROUS
YOU0000005126_S0000875 SO IN ONE WAY WE'RE ASKING FOR YOU TO JUST DO WHAT WAS ALWAYS CORRECT WHICH IS TO TAKE THE PUBLIC'S VOICES AND OPINIONS AND CARE
YOU0000005126_S0000880 THE WORST OF ALL ARE THE FIRST RESPONDERS OR ANYONE WHO'S FORCED TO DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL LABOR WITH THIS ON WE WILL SEE MORE DEATHS BY FAR IF THIS CONTINUES
YOU0000005126_S0000887 ACTUALLY I'M SORRY
YOU0000005126_S0000897 OKAY
YOU0000005126_S0000922 SO SORRY
YOU0000005126_S0000940 AND
YOU0000005126_S0000947 THERE'S HARDLY BEEN ANY EVIDENCE SHOWING THE COVID IS CONTAGIOUS OUTSIDE
YOU0000005126_S0000958 AND OTHER COUNTIES
YOU0000005126_S0000963 AND STILL IT'S VERY DIFFICULT I'M NOT A RUNNER
YOU0000005126_S0000971 AND US AND WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT GENERATIONS TO COME WELL THERE WON'T BE ANY GENERATIONS TO COME IF WE KEEP SCREWING WITH SCIENCE
YOU0000005126_S0000981 OKAY
YOU0000005126_S0000986 AS THERE IS NO MORE DISCUSSION WE'LL GO TO A ROLL CALL
YOU0000005126_S0000991 AYE CHAIR CAPUT AYE
YOU0000005126_S0000999 AS OUTLINED IN THE MEMORANDUM OF THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER
YOU0000005126_S0001006 IS THE GREEN LIGHT ON MY GREEN LIGHT IS ON YEAH
YOU0000005126_S0001016 NOW AS YOU RECALL THE CANNABIS LICENSING PROCESS INCLUDES BOTH A USE PERMIT AND A CANNABIS LICENSE AS OPERATORS HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THE USE PERMIT AND LICENSING PROCESS WE HAVE NOTICED SOME PATTERNS WHICH MAKE THE PROCESS ARDUOUS
YOU0000005126_S0001023 FARMING OPERATIONS CAN'T JUST SWAP CROPS OR CHANGE OUT A CURRENT CROP FOR CANNABIS WITH EASE
YOU0000005126_S0001031 OUR PROPOSED CHANGES DO NOT AFFECT REGULATORY OVERSIGHT IN ANY WAY
YOU0000005126_S0001040 VERY SIMILAR TO OUR BMOP
YOU0000005126_S0001051 NOW
YOU0000005126_S0001059 NOW FOLLOWING ALONG THE SAME THOUGHT THAT CANNABIS CULTIVATION IS AN AGRICULTURAL PROCESS WE'VE ALIGNED THE GREENHOUSE REPLACEMENT RECONSTRUCTION AND STRUCTURAL ALTERATION CHANGES WITH EXISTING GREENHOUSE CODE
YOU0000005126_S0001065 WHICH IS THE SAME SIZE LIMIT AS MEDICAL CULTIVATION ALLOWED BY THE COUNTY AND STATE
YOU0000005126_S0001073 THESE ARE RESTRICTED BECAUSE THEY CANNOT STORE ANY CANNABIS GOODS AT THEIR FACILITY THEY'RE JUST TRANSPORTERS MOVING PRODUCTS BETWEEN BUSINESSES
YOU0000005126_S0001084 THE EXISTING RESTRICTIONS ON NEW STRUCTURES AND DEVELOPMENT REMAIN THE SAME IN THE SAN DISTRICT
YOU0000005126_S0001095 AS PREVIOUSLY STATED THESE MEDICAL CULTIVATION SITES DO NOT REQUIRE ANY PERMIT OR OVERSIGHT AT THE LOCAL OR STATE LEVEL
YOU0000005126_S0001109 WE'RE PROPOSING LOWERING THE PARCEL SIZE
YOU0000005126_S0001115 CONSIDERATION FOR THIS CHANGE WAS RAN PAST THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND THEY EXPRESSED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE PEOPLE IN THE COMMERCIAL SYSTEM WHERE OVERSIGHT AND TRACKING OCCUR
YOU0000005126_S0001122 SAME AS THE MEDICAL GARDEN WITH NO OVERSIGHT FROM THE STATE OR COUNTY
YOU0000005126_S0001127 LICENSES FOR COTTAGE GARDENS ARE NOT LAND USE ENTITLEMENTS
YOU0000005126_S0001139 THE BASELINE FOR COTTAGE LICENSES AND PEOPLE APPLYING FOR USE PERMITS IS ZERO WHICH MAY REFLECT SOME OF THE GOALS OF CERTAIN PC MEMBERS
YOU0000005126_S0001149 WE ESTIMATE THE CURRENT TOTAL TO BE WELL NORTH OF THREE THOUSAND MEDICAL GROWS
YOU0000005126_S0001155 BECAUSE THERE'S ONE NON CONFORMING HOME IN THE SOUTH RODEO GULCH AREA
YOU0000005126_S0001161 DISTANCES BETWEEN THE EDGE OF THE SCHOOL PARCEL AND THE ACTUAL GROW
YOU0000005126_S0001171 WEIGHT OF CANNABIS CONCENTRATE WEIGHT OF CANNABIS FLOUR AND WEIGHT OF CANNABIS BIO MASS
YOU0000005126_S0001177 AND WHEN PAIRED WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE WATER BOARD THE AG COMMISSIONER AND DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE
YOU0000005126_S0001184 WE ARE FOLLOWING THE EXISTING COUNTY CODE FOR PRINCIPALLY PERMITTED USES WHILE MEETING THE BOARD'S GOAL OF SIMPLIFYING THE APPROVAL PROCESS
YOU0000005126_S0001189 THEY GENERATE JOBS AND TAX REVENUE THE PROPOSED CODE AMENDMENTS HELP FURTHER ALIGN THE NON-RETAIL COMMERCIAL CANNABIS PROGRAM WITH THE INITIAL GOAL SET BY THE BOARD
YOU0000005126_S0001205 SO ANYTIME
YOU0000005126_S0001218 OH I DON'T HAVE THE BREAKDOWN FOR MY PC PRESENTATION
YOU0000005126_S0001231 PC RESOLUTION
YOU0000005126_S0001245 THANK YOU
YOU0000005126_S0001260 SO
YOU0000005126_S0001266 I THINK THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE WHICH HAS MADE IT SO NO ONE HAS PURSUED OR WILL EVER PURSUE A COTTAGE LICENSE
YOU0000005126_S0001274 OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION
YOU0000005126_S0001286 BECAUSE THERE'S NO BUILDING PERMIT REQUIRED WE ALREADY HAVE THAT RESTRICTION WAVED WITHIN OUR BUILDING CODE SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CLARIFY THE CANNABIS REGULATIONS WITH THE BUILDING CODE TO HAVE A UNIFORM PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE
YOU0000005126_S0001293 SO THIS HAS BECOME
YOU0000005126_S0001301 BUT IN OUR FEW INDOOR FACILITIES
YOU0000005126_S0001324 THAT ARE GROWING AND SELLING MARIJUANA
YOU0000005126_S0001332 ARE COMING FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC RATHER THAN THE INTERESTED PARTIES THAT HAVE A PROFIT MARGIN
YOU0000005126_S0001341 WE HAVE A PLETHORA OF MEDICAL GROWS THAT ARE FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET WHERE WE HAVE NO OVERSIGHT
YOU0000005126_S0001352 AND THEN WE'VE ALSO REACHED OUT TO GROWERS OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO OTHER COUNTIES TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS PROGRAM WORK IN THE DIRECTION THE BOARD HAS SAID WHICH ARE
YOU0000005126_S0001363 CANNABIS MARIJUANA
YOU0000005126_S0001371 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT GETS YOU HIGH
YOU0000005126_S0001385 WE WILL NOT LET IT BE UTILIZED FOR CANNABIS OPERATIONS
YOU0000005126_S0001397 THERE'S GONNA BE A LOSS OF JOBS RIGHT IF MORE AND MORE OF THE LAND GOES TOWARDS MARIJUANA CULTIVATION
YOU0000005126_S0001412 I THINK THE BOARD AND THE CANNABIS LICENSING OFFICE DID A GREAT JOB
YOU0000005126_S0001417 BUT THERE'S A VERY LIMITED PESTICIDES FUNGICIDES THAT CAN BE USED TO MAINTAIN THE CROP UNLIKE OTHER COMMERCIAL AG PRODUCTS
YOU0000005126_S0001432 WE KEEP CHANGING THE RULES AS WE GO ALONG
YOU0000005126_S0001438 AND ALL THE
YOU0000005126_S0001448 BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING WITH PG AND E
YOU0000005126_S0001459 DON'T HAVE THE TV GOING IF NOBODY'S WATCHING IT
YOU0000005126_S0001470 WHEN YOU AGGREGATE RESOURCES YOU CAN HAVE EVERYBODY GO GREEN
YOU0000005126_S0001477 AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE HERE
YOU0000005126_S0001487 THE FOOD VALUE OF MARIJUANA IS WHAT
YOU0000005126_S0001494 OUR ARGUMENT THEN BECOMES WE'RE NOT FEEDING THE WORLD WE'RE NOT
YOU0000005126_S0001504 WE HAVE CREATED A LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF ACRES THAT CAN BE USED FOR CANNABIS PRODUCTION THIS IS NOT A FOOD OR CANNABIS FIGHT
YOU0000005126_S0001520 NOW WE CAN DISAGREE AND I'M SURE WE'RE GONNA HEAR
YOU0000005126_S0001531 WE SHOULD SUPPORT THESE REGULATION CHANGE
YOU0000005126_S0001542 BECAUSE MARIJUANA PRODUCES LESS JOBS
YOU0000005126_S0001567 THAT WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS CLOSER
YOU0000005126_S0001574 I BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTY'S POSITION HAS BEEN TO SUPPORT CANNABIS CULTIVATION ON CA PROPERTIES AND I THINK IN SUPPORT OF THAT
YOU0000005126_S0001580 MOST OF THOSE
YOU0000005126_S0001589 I
YOU0000005126_S0001602 I GUESS I'M OUT OF TIME
YOU0000005126_S0001618 REMOVING SETBACKS
YOU0000005126_S0001626 THIS IS A MAJOR WATER QUALITY ISSUE
YOU0000005126_S0001638 MY PROTAGONIST ANN
YOU0000005126_S0001649 THAT WAS UNTIL THE COUNTY'S NEW RULES ALLOWED A ZERO SETBACK FROM THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE
YOU0000005126_S0001656 HE CUTS SOME TREES AND PLANTED A BIG POT FARM
YOU0000005126_S0001665 RIGHT ON THE PROPERTY LINE
YOU0000005126_S0001679 THANK YOU
YOU0000005126_S0001687 THEY'RE IN TROUBLE
YOU0000005126_S0001700 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS WERE ALWAYS MEANT FOR MINOR VIOLATIONS THAT WAS IN THE ENFORCEMENT PLAN THAT WAS PRESENTED TO YOU
YOU0000005126_S0001721 I THINK THAT'S EVIDENT THROUGH
YOU0000005126_S0001733 ESPECIALLY THESE TIMES SO I DON'T WANT YOU GUYS LOSE YOUR JOBS LIKE I DID SO LET'S GET THIS RIGHT THANK YOU
YOU0000005126_S0001738 THE FIRST PERSON IS FROM
YOU0000005126_S0001746 THIS HAPPENED ALREADY UNDER THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA REGULATIONS DO NOT LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN FOR COMMERCIAL CULTIVATION
YOU0000005126_S0001754 STUDIED DEBATED AND MAJOR DECISIONS TO GUIDE THE GROWING OF CANNABIS IN A WAY THAT SOUGHT TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF NEIGHBORHOODS DIMINISH NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON WILDLIFE AND THE ENVIRONMENT
YOU0000005126_S0001769 I AND MANY OTHERS ARE FEELING ABSOLUTELY BETRAYED BY THE MAJOR CHANGES AND ASPECT TO THE ORDINANCE THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT RURAL RESIDENTS
YOU0000005126_S0001775 WE REJECT THE IDEA THAT IT'S OKAY FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS MOVED HERE
YOU0000005126_S0001792 THE SUPERVISORS ARE WELL AWARE THE RANGE IS HARMFUL TO PUBLIC SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY IMPACTS
YOU0000005126_S0001798 I'M SORRY THAT'S THE SAME ONE SHE HAS ONE MORE IN HERE
YOU0000005126_S0001805 BY HIS OWN ADMISSION THE LICENSING OFFICE WHOSE BUDGET IS PAID FOR FROM COUNTY TAXES
YOU0000005126_S0001810 OUR COMPANY IS A CANNABIS COMPANY
YOU0000005126_S0001816 AS A LOCAL CANNABIS COMPANY WE WOULD PREFER TO EXPAND AND CREATE OUR JOBS
YOU0000005126_S0001823 LOCAL TAXES AND LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS
YOU0000005126_S0001830 FOR PUTTING IN THE TIME AND ENERGY TO HELP MAKE OUR CANNABIS LICENSING PROGRAM FULLY OPERATIONAL
YOU0000005126_S0001837 EVEN THE CURRENT COTTAGE LICENSE SETBACKS ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO COMPLY WITH
YOU0000005126_S0001842 NEXT COMMENT IS FROM STACY SAEDA
YOU0000005126_S0001849 NEXT COMMENT IS FROM NANCY MACY

YOU0000005126_S0001863 I'M GONNA EDIT THIS ONE AND NOT READ PART OF THIS ENTIRE RECORD BECAUSE IT'S EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE
YOU0000005126_S0001868 IT'S NOT FOOD VERSUS WEED IT'S SENSIBLE FARMING USING CROP ROTATIONS
YOU0000005126_S0001876 WHILE THE BOARD MAY HAVE ISSUES WITH OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE CHANGES
YOU0000005126_S0001896 THAT WAS NOT ENVISIONED FOR SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY TO AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCIAL USES
YOU0000005126_S0001907 AND THE
YOU0000005126_S0001916 MINIMUM PARCEL SIZES FOR CULTIVATION AS SUPERVISOR MCPHERSON WAS JUST REFERENCING
YOU0000005126_S0001933 BUT I DON'T THINK THE SOLUTION TO FIX THIS PROBLEM
YOU0000005126_S0001951 IN ANY OTHER PLACE EXCEPT CANNABIS
YOU0000005126_S0001963 OF AND REMOVE THE LEVEL FIVE PROCESS BUT SECONDLY IN I'M JUST ASKING FOR A BROADER DISCUSSION BACK AT THE BOARD ABOUT
YOU0000005126_S0001976 THIS BOARD HAS BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT IN SAYING THAT WE WOULD PREFER TO HAVE
YOU0000005126_S0001990 ABOUT WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING
YOU0000005126_S0002012 I'D LIKE TO SEE IT PUT OFF UNTIL AUGUST
YOU0000005126_S0002037 ALLOWING THAT ZONE BACK THOSE ZONES BACK IN

YOU0000005126_S0002075 OKAY
YOU0000005126_S0002084 OKAY HERE WE ARE
YOU0000005126_S0002099 JURISDICTIONS THAT CHOOSE A GROSS RECEIPTS TAX
YOU0000005126_S0002107 DATA WAS PROVIDED IN THE STAFF REPORT WHICH SOUGHT TO CREATE EQUIVALENCIES IN CALCULATIONS BETWEEN THE GROSS RECEIPTS AND THE SQUARE FOOTAGE TAX
YOU0000005126_S0002118 SO LET'S CONCENTRATE ON THEM SINCE THEY ARE OUR MOST PREVALENT FORM OF CANNABIS GROWERS IN THE COUNTY
YOU0000005126_S0002129 I'M NOT SURE HE HAS A QUESTION
YOU0000005126_S0002146 THAN THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS
YOU0000005126_S0002154 WHAT MONTEREY IS CHARGING FOR AN INDOOR CULTIVATION SITE AND WHAT THE EQUIVALENCY GETS TO BE WHEN WE CHARGE A GROSS RECEIPTS TAX
YOU0000005126_S0002170 IT'S FIFTY PERCENT GREATER THAN SAN LUIS OBISPO A COUNTY THAT WE USUALLY COMPARE OURSELVES TO
YOU0000005126_S0002180 SONOMA
YOU0000005126_S0002193 AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S
YOU0000005126_S0002209 IT IS COMPLICATED BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT TAX STRUCTURES
YOU0000005126_S0002222 SO
YOU0000005126_S0002231 THEY'D HAVE TO SELL ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY OR WE'RE GONNA FACE A REVENUE LOSS
YOU0000005126_S0002243 AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT IMPACTED
YOU0000005126_S0002252 ON A RECREATIONAL PRODUCT IS

YOU0000005126_S0002308 WELL LET ME JUST THIS IS RYAN LET ME JUST SAY
YOU0000005126_S0002315 AND IN MANY WAYS YOU COULD ARGUE BE MUCH BETTER FOR THE CONSUMER IF YOU COULD BUY CANNABIS ON ANY CORNER
YOU0000005126_S0002328 I CAN TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHERE THE TAXES HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS SO RETAIL
YOU0000005126_S0002336 SO WE DIDN'T SEE ANY DRAMATIC DECREASE
YOU0000005126_S0002347 MY MOTION WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS ALONG WITH THE OTHER
YOU0000005126_S0002365 AND CIGARETTES CIGARETTES HAVE LIKE
YOU0000005126_S0002381 YOU HAVE A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE CULTIVATION SPACE
YOU0000005126_S0002399 I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO GET INTO THAT DISCUSSION MAYBE I SHOULD ASK THE COUNTY COUNSEL IF THAT'S
YOU0000005126_S0002405 I'M NOT RECOMMENDING A CHANGE IN THE RETAIL TAX AT THIS TIME
YOU0000005126_S0002424 WERE ABLE TO GET LICENSES NEED TAX
YOU0000005126_S0002434 SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO
YOU0000005126_S0002445 DID SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY GREAT IS THAT

YOU0000005126_S0002505 INCREASE VOLUME AND SUSTAIN OR INCREASE THE TAX REVENUE TO THE COUNTY
YOU0000005126_S0002514 SO ANYWAY I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE MY POINT OF VIEW
YOU0000005126_S0002534 SO THIS CHANGE COULD HAVE A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EFFECT IF EVERYTHING STAYED THE SAME
YOU0000005126_S0002540 THEIR SALES ARE IMPACTED AND THEN THAT IMPACTS OUR TAX
YOU0000005126_S0002559 AND NOT COME BACK THEN IN ANOTHER WEEK TO CONSIDER LOWERING OF THE RATE SO MY SUBSTITUTE MOTION IS JUST FOR THE RECOMMENDED ACTIONS WHICH IS JUST TO ACCEPT AND FILE THE REPORT

YOU0000005142_S0000101 AND THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT HER
YOU0000005142_S0000108 EVERYTHING'S PERFECT
YOU0000005142_S0000114 WHO KNOWS WHERE THE POPPY STORYLINE WILL LEAD
YOU0000005142_S0000119 THEY'LL HAVE TO INVEST THEIR TIME IN FINDING IT
YOU0000005142_S0000124 IF YOU LOOK BACK AT POPPY'S ACCOUNTS YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THEY WERE CREATED YEARS BEFORE ANYTHING WAS POSTED
YOU0000005142_S0000132 AND REMEMBER

YOU0000005142_S0000180 I EVEN FOUND A VIDEO COMPILATION OF TWENTY THREE YOUTUBERS COVERING SKYFALL BY ADELE AND POPPY IS OF COURSE ONE OF THE FEATURED PERFORMERS
YOU0000005142_S0000186 IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE TO REMOVE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT CONFLICT WITH POPPY'S IMAGE ESPECIALLY OLD OR INACTIVE PROJECTS THAT DON'T REFLECT POPPY'S CURRENT STATE
YOU0000005142_S0000192 I EVEN FOUND THIS INTERVIEW WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY ONE WHERE POPPY IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OUT OF CHARACTER
YOU0000005142_S0000199 AS TITANIC SINCLAIR SAID IN THE INTERVIEW I MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S NOT THAT STRANGE TO MEET CELEBRITIES IN COMMON PLACES WHEN YOU LIVE IN LOS ANGELES

YOU0000005160_S0000155 NOT A DAY GOES BY THAT WE DON'T HEAR SOMETHING FROM A PATIENT OR A PHYSICIAN OR A GROUP OF PEOPLE PERHAPS INTERESTED IN STARTING A CLINIC OR A SUPPORT GROUP
YOU0000005160_S0000167 THEY SAID THAT ONE WAS SUSPICIOUS OF METASTASIS BUT THEY DIDN'T THINK SO
YOU0000005160_S0000182 I DID THE THERAPY NINETEEN YEARS AGO

YOU0000005160_S0000419 TO HELP DESTROY CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES
YOU0000005160_S0000427 THE GERSON THERAPY UTILIZES SOME OF THEM IN THE RECOVERY PROCESS
YOU0000005160_S0000435 IT IS ESTIMATED THAT OUR UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTANCE OF HOLISTIC MEDICINE IS STILL SEVENTY FIVE YEARS BEHIND THE REST OF THE WORLD
YOU0000005160_S0000444 MASS-PRODUCED COMMERCIALLY GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PRODUCED WITH CHEMICALS AND SPRAYS ARE FERTILIZED WITH ONLY THREE MINERALS NITROGEN

YOU0000005200_S0000149 FROM RUNNING OFF TO THE PUB FOR PIE AND GUINNESS
YOU0000005200_S0000165 ARCH TRAM
YOU0000005208_S0000016 YOU KNOW THE GRIND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CONSUME MY CONTENT SEE WHERE I AM NOW
YOU0000005208_S0000023 WASTE MONEY ON DUMB SHIT
YOU0000005208_S0000042 I BELIEVE THAT I'M ACTUALLY A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER
YOU0000005208_S0000047 TIKTOK'S SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S LISTENING IS THE FOLLOWING
YOU0000005208_S0000052 AND IF THE DEMO GETS OLDER
YOU0000005208_S0000060 I WAS ON ALL THESE THINGS THAT DID NOT GO ON TO WIN
YOU0000005208_S0000071 YOU RUN COMMERCIALS ON IT
YOU0000005208_S0000084 BUT THERE IS ATTENTION
YOU0000005208_S0000095 THEY MAKE THEIR WHOLE LIVELIHOODS ON IT THE PLATFORM WAS FREE
YOU0000005208_S0000113 PEOPLE LOVE TO BLAME OTHER THINGS WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF IF YOU'RE SO SAD ABOUT INSTAGRAM ORGANIC REACH WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TO GETTING PAID MINIMUM WAGE
YOU0000005208_S0000119 THIS OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT
YOU0000005208_S0000135 THEY ALL EVOLVE
YOU0000005208_S0000142 I WILL SAY THAT VOICE IS VERY MUCH ON MY MIND
YOU0000005208_S0000157 WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT'S GONNA
YOU0000005208_S0000171 CONTENT CREATION IN PLACES WHERE THE ATTENTION IS AFFORDABLE IS A FRAMEWORK THAT EVERYBODY NEEDS TO CONSIDER
YOU0000005208_S0000176 YOU ARE BASICALLY NOT RELEVANT GOING FORWARD IN MY OPINION
YOU0000005216_S0000019 THEN I GET REALLY SAD AND CRY
YOU0000005216_S0000025 HI GUYS
YOU0000005216_S0000041 THAT THE MAP WILL ACTUALLY START DOWNLOADING TILES
YOU0000005216_S0000047 IT'S NOT TOO BAD BUT IT'S NOT GREAT
YOU0000005216_S0000053 THAT'S THIRTEEN SECONDS LATER THAN YOU WOULD ON A DESKTOP PLATFORM
YOU0000005216_S0000061 THEY CAN START DOWNLOADING THE TILES
YOU0000005216_S0000069 PUT THAT INTO INTO THE MAPTIVE
YOU0000005216_S0000081 I HAVE A LITTLE DEMO HERE
YOU0000005216_S0000095 THE JAVASCRIPT API IS ACTUALLY DOWNLOADED
YOU0000005216_S0000107 SO IF YOU MULTIPLY THAT WHAT YOU GET IS FOUR POINT FOUR SECONDS
YOU0000005216_S0000115 THERE'S A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO THIS WORK
YOU0000005216_S0000121 SHOW-STOPPER FOR US
YOU0000005216_S0000131 YOU KNOW A FEW BULLET POINTS OF WHY WE THINK THAT V THREE IS SO SPECIAL
YOU0000005216_S0000144 AND SUSANNAH
YOU0000005216_S0000151 YOU CAN MAKE MAPS THAT WORK REALLY WELL ON IT
YOU0000005216_S0000158 AND THEN MY BROWSER GOT REALLY SLOW
YOU0000005216_S0000164 AND YOU GET BACK TEN LABELED MARKERS
YOU0000005216_S0000169 THEY WANTED HOTSPOTS THAT WOULD WORK IN EVERY SINGLE BROWSER
YOU0000005216_S0000174 SO THAT MEANS IF YOU TRY AND PUT TEN THOUSAND MARKERS ON A MAP WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY PUTTING ON A MAP IS SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY THOUSAND DOM NODES
YOU0000005216_S0000184 AND THEN WE HAVE THE MARKERS SO THAT KIND OF TOOK A WHILE AND THEN WELL PANNING ISN'T REALLY LIKE THAT FUN
YOU0000005216_S0000193 I WORK FOR REDFIN WE'RE AN ONLINE WEB REAL-ESTATE COMPANY
YOU0000005216_S0000209 SO WE DID
YOU0000005216_S0000222 AND ALL IT'S DOING RIGHT HERE IS JUST CREATING A DIV ELEMENT AND ADDING IT TO A PARTICULAR PANE IN THE MAP
YOU0000005216_S0000231 BUT IT'S ALSO SO YOU WANNA REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DOM NODES AND WE'RE ONLY DOING ONE DOM NODE PER MARKER HERE
YOU0000005216_S0000240 I DON'T KNOW MAYBE A HUNDRED DIFFERENT ICONS DEPENDING ON WHAT KIND OF HOUSE IT IS WHAT TYPE OF HOUSE WHETHER IT'S A FAVORITE OF YOURS ET CETERA
YOU0000005216_S0000249 AND UNDERNEATH THE COVERS
YOU0000005216_S0000258 YOU GUYS ARE CHEATING YOU CAN SEE TOO MUCH
YOU0000005216_S0000264 YOU KNOW CHANGING THE Z INDEX
YOU0000005216_S0000272 YOU CAN SEE IT HERE AND THEY HAVE STUFF LIKE
YOU0000005216_S0000296 BASICALLY
YOU0000005216_S0000304 BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE TEN THOUSAND MARKERS
YOU0000005216_S0000314 AND IT'S PRETTY COOL BECAUSE YOU CAN GO AND
YOU0000005216_S0000327 AND IT'S NICE THIS IS A SEARCH FOR PIZZA SO THIS IS JUST TO GIVE ME A GENERAL IDEA
YOU0000005216_S0000335 SO WE WANTED TO HAVE A WAY OF INDICATING THAT TO THE USER AND GIVING THEM A BETTER WAY OF VISUALIZING WHAT THEIR SEARCH RESULT REALLY LOOKED LIKE
YOU0000005216_S0000343 AND THAT'S WHERE THE MOST NUMBER OF LOCAL SEARCH RESULTS ARE
YOU0000005216_S0000350 AND YOU CAN LOOK AND SEE THE JSON
YOU0000005216_S0000361 AND VIDEOS WIKIPEDIA
YOU0000005216_S0000367 AND YOU CAN SEE HERE AS I MOUSE OVER
YOU0000005216_S0000378 SO JOHN YOU SHOULD RAISE YOUR HANDS BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS YEAH SO I KNOW SOME OF YOU ASKED ME EARLIER ABOUT THIS SO YOU SHOULD TALK TO JOHN AFTER IF YOU'RE CURIOUS FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW HE DID THIS
YOU0000005216_S0000388 ALL RIGHT SO HE JUST HE'S IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM
YOU0000005216_S0000395 EXCEPT IE
YOU0000005216_S0000403 YES
YOU0000005216_S0000411 BUT IT'S NOT REALLY THAT NECESSARY ANYMORE YOU JUST DO A NICE LITTLE JAVASCRIPT FUNCTION AND FOR THE MOST PART IT WILL WORK

YOU0000005216_S0000461 AND USING THE FLASH API AND THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU CAN GO AND BRING IT UP IN THE DIFFERENT BROWSERS AND YOU'LL SEE IN CHROME ACTUALLY IT'S PRETTY SIMILAR BECAUSE CANVAS AND FLASH HAVE PRETTY GOOD PERFORMANCE
YOU0000005216_S0000472 SO WE'LL DO IMAGES OUTLINE IMAGES ALL IMAGES
YOU0000005216_S0000490 SO THIS PROGRAM IS TO HELP US FIND ALL THE QUALIFIED MAPS API DEVELOPERS OUT THERE AND BADGE YOU AND BE ABLE TO POINT PEOPLE TO YOU
YOU0000005216_S0000501 NO QUESTIONS
YOU0000005216_S0000510 DO YOU KNOW OF ANY IMPLEMENTATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE LIKE A GROUP OF MARKERS ON A MAP AND IT AUTO-DETERMINES WHAT THE APPROPRIATE ZOOM LEVEL IS SO THAT THEY'RE NOT ALL BUNCHED UP TOGETHER
YOU0000005216_S0000520 HAVE CLOSE TO FOUR THOUSAND MARKERS
YOU0000005216_S0000532 IT JUST HAS THE LAT-LONG INFORMATION AND
YOU0000005216_S0000550 AND IN THE GROUP WE HAVE
YOU0000005216_S0000560 AND THEY ALSO OFFER A WEB SERVICE AS WELL TO GIVE BACK THE GEOMETRY
YOU0000005216_S0000572 IT'S JUST PUTTING ON THE MAP AND THEN HOWEVER WE RENDER IT IS HOW WE RENDER IT AND YOU CAN'T CONTROL IT
YOU0000005216_S0000591 AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU0000005216_S0000604 JUST A KIND OF GENERAL QUESTION
YOU0000005216_S0000624 SO EVENTUALLY EVERYTHING SHOULD BE SUPPORTED IN SOME WAY
YOU0000005216_S0000633 SO YOU NOTICE THAT WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T PUT CLASSES LIKE THAT INTO A MAPS API
YOU0000005224_S0000010 HIS GRANDSON SPENCER READ A LITTLE PIECE WHICH I THINK I'LL SHARE WITH YOU TODAY

YOU0000005232_S0000248 AND PLEASE DO VISIT GTUGS DOT ORG ON LINE
YOU0000005232_S0000260 YOU HAVE TO BE THERE
YOU0000005232_S0000267 BRIAN SHARP HAS SOME CONCRETE PRACTICES THAT'LL MAKE YOU A BETTER LEADER AND A BETTER PERSON
YOU0000005232_S0000272 I LIKE FORTUNE COOKIES NEXT TIME YOU OPEN ONE
YOU0000005232_S0000278 THANKS AGAIN
YOU0000005232_S0000290 THAT INDUSTRIAL WIND FARM USED TO BE OUR FAMILY'S GENERAL STORE
YOU0000005232_S0000305 THEY WERE FLAMBOYANT AND FUNNY AND PROVOCATIVE AND POLITICAL AND PEOPLE STARTED FLOCKING TO THEM
YOU0000005232_S0000321 OR WE FIND OUT THAT IT WAS A PLACE WHERE A RADIOACTIVE WASTE FACILITY IS ABOUT TO BE BUILT
YOU0000005232_S0000334 AND THEY CAN DO THESE LITTLE THINGS IN COMPLETE ISOLATION FROM ONE ANOTHER AND THEY CALL IT ARTIFICIAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
YOU0000005232_S0000358 AND DIRECTOR JAMES FROST AND WE SHOT THIS VIDEO USING LASER SCANNERS AS THREE D DATA
YOU0000005232_S0000371 THEY ARE HAND DRAWN FRAMES THAT PEOPLE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO MAKE THIS MUSIC VIDEO THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING
YOU0000005232_S0000383 AND HIS TEAM AND HIS TEAM
YOU0000005232_S0000408 A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE HOBBY MAKE PLANS FOR THESE SHIPS
YOU0000005232_S0000439 WHO'S HERE FROM THE BAY AREA
YOU0000005232_S0000458 AND MOVE TOWARD THE OBJECT COLLBORATE ON THAT
YOU0000005232_S0000465 I THOUGHT LET'S CREATE ELIZA
YOU0000005232_S0000480 I BELIEVE I WAS THE FIRST PERSON OUTSIDE GOOGLE TO CREATE A GOOGLE WAVE ROBOT
YOU0000005232_S0000492 THAT IN GOOGLE WAVE YOU CAN ACTUALLY REMOVE A PARTICIPANT FROM A WAVE
YOU0000005232_S0000510 SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES FOR US TODAY
YOU0000005232_S0000519 AND IN CASE YOU CAME IN LATE EVERYBODY HERE IS DOING IGNITE TALKS THEY ARE JUST FIVE MINUTES LONG
YOU0000005232_S0000542 I'M COMPETING WITH MY OWN DAMNED SLIDES
YOU0000005232_S0000558 AND LAUGH AT IT AND GET HOURS OF LAUGHTER OUT OF IT YOU CAN ACTUALLY PROGRESS THAT AND PUT SOMEBODY ELSE'S FACE IN IT TRY A DIFFERENT ANIMAL PHOTOSHOP IT AND ACTUALLY EVOLVE THE CULTURE BECAUSE WE'RE SUBVERSSIVE
YOU0000005232_S0000577 SOME BELIEVE THE ADJACENT SPHINX IS EVEN OLDER
YOU0000005232_S0000590 WHICH IS WHY PERSIANS STILL KNOW HIM TODAY AS ALEXANDER THE DOUCH
YOU0000005232_S0000601 NOTICE HOW THE DRAWINGS ARE ORIENTED NOT ALONG THE NORTH SOUTH POLAR AXIS BUT STRICTLY PARALLEL TO THE IMAGINARY LINE OF ANCIENT COSMIC WEIRDNESS
YOU0000005232_S0000617 EFFECTIVELY PRESERVING KNOWLEDGE FROM OTHER MAPS HAVE BEEN LOST TO HISTORY
YOU0000005240_S0000008 SO ALSO IF YOU'D LIKE TO CONTACT ME LATER OR YOU HAVE A QUESTION THAT POPS IN YOUR MIND YOU CAN DO THAT AS WELL
YOU0000005240_S0000014 AND EVEN IN CANADA LIKE ONTARIO
YOU0000005240_S0000020 IT ALL STARTED WITH AN IDEA
YOU0000005240_S0000026 AND LET'S SAY THAT WE'RE GOING IN AND STUDYING THE SKELETAL SYSTEM ALL RIGHT
YOU0000005240_S0000032 AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE BACK IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE THIS
YOU0000005240_S0000038 AND WHEN I LOOK AT THIS THING THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT THE SNOUT OF THE GIRAFFE RIGHT
YOU0000005240_S0000044 THAT'S THAT STRUCTURE
YOU0000005240_S0000050 SO EVEN THOUGH YOU GUYS MIGHT HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE YOU CAN SEE THE SIMILARITY IN THE STRUCTURE
YOU0000005240_S0000055 AND I USED TO JUST DRAW LITTLE SKETCHES
YOU0000005240_S0000066 LET ME TAKE A LOOK
YOU0000005240_S0000071 FRIENDS OF MINE WHO ARE AUTHORS TOLD ME
YOU0000005240_S0000076 BUT JUST HAVING THE IDEA ISN'T ENOUGH NOW YOU GOTTA FOLLOW THROUGH
YOU0000005240_S0000081 SO
YOU0000005240_S0000088 SO THESE SHOW YOU SOME MORE ANALOGIES FROM DIFFERENT THINGS THESE ARE BONES FROM THE SKELETAL SYSTEM
YOU0000005240_S0000096 THAT HIT THE MARKET AND THAT DID REALLY WELL AND THEN MY PUBLISHER ENCOURAGED ME TO THINK ABOUT SOME OTHER ONES SO I LATER DID A SECOND BOOK
YOU0000005240_S0000103 SO LIKE IF YOU GO TO A UNIVERSITY THEY TEND TO HAVE THEIR ANATOMY AND THEIR PHYSIOLOGY COURSES SEPARATE
YOU0000005240_S0000110 THAT JUST CAME OUT IN ITS SECOND EDITION
YOU0000005240_S0000117 AND IT HAS TEXT ON THE LEFT AND IT HAS ILLUSTRATIONS ON THE RIGHT
YOU0000005240_S0000123 CAUSE THEY ONLY THINK IN TERMS OF RIGID CATEGORIES LIKE THAT TEXTBOOK LAB MANUAL
YOU0000005240_S0000130 SO THERE'S ALREADY BEEN ANATOMY COLORING BOOKS ON THE MARKET BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL COLOR-CODE THINGS
YOU0000005240_S0000135 AND I HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE CONVINCING PUBLISHERS THAT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA CAUSE AGAIN IT DIDN'T FIT INTO THEIR TEXTBOOK LAB MANUAL PARADIGM IN THEIR HEAD
YOU0000005240_S0000142 THIS IS THE COMBINATION ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY BOOK THAT'S IN ITS THIRD EDITION
YOU0000005240_S0000155 AND THEN I'VE ALWAYS BEEN DRAWING
YOU0000005240_S0000164 SO
YOU0000005240_S0000170 AND HE BASICALLY TAUGHT ME A LOT OF THINGS
YOU0000005240_S0000178 BUT HE DID A LOT OF THINGS HIMSELF BUT I USED TO JUST KIND OF BE AMAZED AT ALL THE THINGS HE ACCOMPLISHED AND GOT DONE JUST BY HIS OWN DRIVE AND HE WAS REALLY ORGANIZED
YOU0000005240_S0000184 AND ANOTHER THING HE DID WAS HE WAS REALLY A STICKLER FOR USING GRAMMAR PROPERLY SO HE WAS A GRAMMARIAN HE WOULD CORRECT ME IF I HAD INCORRECT ENGLISH OR SAID THINGS WRONG AND AT THE TIME I THOUGHT OH THAT'S A PAIN
YOU0000005240_S0000189 I WAS A STUDENT HERE AT GRAND RAPIDS WHEN IT WAS CALLED JUNIOR COLLEGE BEFORE IT BECAME A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO
YOU0000005240_S0000196 SO BOTTOM LINE IS I WAS A STUDENT HERE AND WHEN I WAS A STUDENT HERE IN HIGH SCHOOL
YOU0000005240_S0000201 HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS I EVER HAD
YOU0000005240_S0000208 AND THAT LEFT A BIG IMPRESSION ON ME
YOU0000005240_S0000214 THIRD DRAFT AND I THOUGHT
YOU0000005240_S0000223 IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU DO AND GET RIGHT PERFECT THE FIRST TIME
YOU0000005240_S0000231 THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN KNOW YOU YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED
YOU0000005240_S0000237 HE TAUGHT AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO
YOU0000005240_S0000243 SO HE HELPED ME A LOT
YOU0000005240_S0000252 HE TOLD ME EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS GONNA BE
YOU0000005240_S0000260 MEANS IT DOESN'T GET BUNDLED WITH ANYTHING SO YOU WANNA HAVE IT AS YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT TITLE
YOU0000005240_S0000265 THIS GUY'S NAME IS KEVIN PATTON
YOU0000005240_S0000273 SO HE HELPED ME A LOT HE KINDA SAW ME THROUGH AS I WAS GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS SO
YOU0000005240_S0000280 SO HERE'S WHAT KEVIN PATTON TOLD ME HE SAID
YOU0000005240_S0000289 AND I FOUND THAT WHAT HE SAID IS REALLY TRUE
YOU0000005240_S0000296 I STARTED OFF WITH REALLY BIG PUBLISHERS IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD
YOU0000005240_S0000306 THEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE UGLY SIDE OF PUBLISHING
YOU0000005240_S0000316 I'M GONNA FLY INTO GRAND RAPIDS
YOU0000005240_S0000323 AND THEN BASICALLY I WENT INTO MY BIG PITCH
YOU0000005240_S0000328 WHAT HAPPENED
YOU0000005240_S0000334 SO
YOU0000005240_S0000341 HE SAID TELL HER RESPOND TO ME YES OR NO BY THIS DATE CAUSE I GOTTA HAVE A FIRM ANSWER
YOU0000005240_S0000347 SHE SAID THEY SAID
YOU0000005240_S0000352 I SAID SO THEN I STARTED TO REALIZE
YOU0000005240_S0000357 SO IT BECAME REALLY REALLY CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS WAS GONNA BE A WHOLE LOT HARDER THAN I THOUGHT
YOU0000005240_S0000365 MAYBE I NEED TO GO TO A SMALLER PUBLISHER THAT IS A GOOD FIT
YOU0000005240_S0000370 THEY WERE NOT EXPENSIVE
YOU0000005240_S0000375 SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
YOU0000005240_S0000380 AND WE CAN MAKE IT EFFECTIVE
YOU0000005240_S0000388 SO WHEN YOU WRITE A BOOK PROPOSAL THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS REALIZE THAT EVERY PUBLISHER IS DIFFERENT SO ONE PUBLISHER HAS ONE TEMPLATE THAT YOU WANNA FOLLOW
YOU0000005240_S0000396 BUT THIS WENT REALLY WELL WITH MORTON
YOU0000005240_S0000403 WELL THE BUSINESS END OF PUBLISHING I LEARNED THAT THIS IS A BUSINESS IT CAN BE A BRUTAL BUSINESS
YOU0000005240_S0000409 IF YOU HAVE AN INVENTION YOU WANNA PATENT IT THEY WOULD DO THINGS LIKE THAT YOU'RE A NOVELIST THEY WOULD HELP YOU WITH THINGS LIKE THAT
YOU0000005240_S0000419 FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A PUBLISHER PAYS YOU A ROYALTY
YOU0000005240_S0000426 SO ALL OF THOSE WERE REALLY REALLY HELPFUL BY JOINING THAT PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION
YOU0000005240_S0000431 AND THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANNA SIGN YOUR LIFE AWAY
YOU0000005240_S0000437 THEY'LL TELL YOU THEY'LL USUALLY USE A LINE LIKE THIS IS OUR STANDARD CONTRACT FOR ALL OUR AUTHORS THAT'S WHEN YOU STAND BACK AND SAY
YOU0000005240_S0000444 SO I BASICALLY SAW THE NEGOTIATION IT HAPPENED VIA EMAIL
YOU0000005240_S0000457 TO GET IT AS CLOSE TO FIFTY FIFTY KNOWING THAT IT'S WAY OUTWEIGHED IN THE PUBLISHER'S FAVOR YOU WANNA GET IT AS CLOSE TO FIFTY FIFTY AS YOU CAN
YOU0000005240_S0000466 SO ILLUSTRATING WRITING AND ILLUSTRATING THE BOOK THAT'S THE HARDEST PART RIGHT
YOU0000005240_S0000475 SAY YES
YOU0000005240_S0000481 CHEAPY CONSUMER ONES YOU CAN BUY
YOU0000005240_S0000488 THAT'S HOW I CREATED ALL MY ILLUSTRATION
YOU0000005240_S0000493 SO
YOU0000005240_S0000500 REWRITING IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET THE FINAL PRODUCT AND THAT WAS TRUE WHEN I WAS WRITING THE BOOK
YOU0000005240_S0000509 I HAD A FAMILY I HAD A FULL-TIME JOB WHERE AM I GONNA FIND THE TIME
YOU0000005240_S0000515 WHEN YOU WRITE A BOOK THERE'S NO GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS
YOU0000005240_S0000524 OH MY GOD THAT'S HUNDREDS OF ILLUSTRATIONS THAT'S A TON OF WORK HOW WILL I EVER GET IT DONE
YOU0000005240_S0000531 BUT HOW MANY WILL I HAVE DONE IN A YEAR
YOU0000005240_S0000537 ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE
YOU0000005240_S0000543 I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT AFTER DOING THE FIRST BOOK IT WENT REALLY WELL AS I SAID AND THEN THAT CONTINUED BOOKS ON IN THE SERIES
YOU0000005240_S0000550 AND SO AGAIN THE PROCESS IS PROBABLY THE MOST INTERESTING PART
YOU0000005240_S0000555 OKAY WELL IF YOU DO YOU HAVE MY CONTACT INFORMATION
YOU0000005248_S0000192 AND I IF YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT
YOU0000005256_S0000007 AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT EILEEN ROCKEFELLER GROWALD AND ABBY ROCKEFELLER HIS DAUGHTERS ARE BOTH HERE THIS EVENING SO I THINK WE'LL THANK YOU
YOU0000005256_S0000016 HE STUDIES THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN INSECTS AND PLANTS
YOU0000005256_S0000021 INCLUDING THE STUDY OF BEETLES AND MOSQUITOES AROUND THE WORLD
YOU0000005256_S0000029 SO I COULD GO ON FOR A LONG TIME BUT I DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE I REALLY WANT AS YOU DO TO BRING BRIAN FERRELL UP ONTO THE STAGE PLEASE WELCOME HIM WITH ME
YOU0000005256_S0000034 I'VE KNOWN HIS FAMILY FOR FORTY YEARS
YOU0000005256_S0000047 DAVID CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY TO SAY WELL
YOU0000005256_S0000054 AND HERE I AM TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT
YOU0000005256_S0000066 I SAW THE FAMOUS BEETLE ROOM THAT I'LL SHOW YOU IN A LITTLE BIT
YOU0000005256_S0000086 ESPECIALLY SINCE MANY PEOPLE FIND MY LIFELONG PASSION FOR BEETLES A LITTLE ECCENTRIC PERHAPS
YOU0000005256_S0000100 WHICH MAKE THEM EASIER TO PRESERVE THAN MANY OTHER INSECTS
YOU0000005256_S0000106 LUTZ WAS A SUPERB TEACHER ENJOYED WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND INVITE HIM TO SPEND THE FOLLOWING SUMMERS AT THE STATION FOR THE STUDY OF INSECTS AT TUXEDO PARK
YOU0000005256_S0000114 THAT THE NUMBERS OF INSECTS WORLDWIDE HAVE DECLINED BY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT BY THIS RECENT STUDY PUBLISHED IN GERMANY OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS
YOU0000005256_S0000124 IT SHOWS THE ORDERLINESS OF NATURE
YOU0000005256_S0000131 SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THESE HAVE BEEN REVEALED TO THE PUBLIC
YOU0000005256_S0000136 REMARKABLE
YOU0000005256_S0000142 AMAZING
YOU0000005256_S0000148 A FROG
YOU0000005256_S0000161 HE ALWAYS HAD A HAND LENS AS WELL NEARBY
YOU0000005256_S0000170 JUNE TWENTY SEVEN DEAR DR LUTZ
YOU0000005256_S0000188 NOTES ABOUT THE NEW GENERA OR SEE THIS OTHER PAPER
YOU0000005256_S0000201 A DOLLAR-A-YEAR MAN FROM BEVERLY MASSACHUSETTS
YOU0000005256_S0000218 THAT SHOWS YOU WHERE HIS HEART WAS RIGHT
YOU0000005256_S0000232 NOW WHILE I COULDN'T HAVE
YOU0000005256_S0000247 OUT OF THAT SUMMER SPENT IN GERMANY AT THAT TIME SEEING THE RISE OF HITLER
YOU0000005256_S0000254 SO THE SUMMER FOLLOWING HIS SOPHOMORE YEAR
YOU0000005256_S0000267 REALLY QUITE REMARKABLE
YOU0000005256_S0000280 THE HIGHEST PEAK THERE
YOU0000005256_S0000306 LUTZ ALWAYS OUT COLLECTING EVERY PLACE ELSE
YOU0000005256_S0000313 AND ONE OF THE BOYS FRED SOLANA
YOU0000005256_S0000321 AND IN FACT UPSTAIRS WE HAVE THEIR INSECT COLLECTIONS THEY MADE AS CHILDREN
YOU0000005256_S0000331 THESE ARE THE COLLECTIONS HE MADE THROUGHOUT ALGERIA LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF BEETLES
YOU0000005256_S0000350 DURANGO COLIMA
YOU0000005256_S0000362 SO I TOOK HIM AND YOU CAN IMAGINE IT WAS NOT VERY NICE VERY CROWDED AND NOT TOO CLEAN
YOU0000005256_S0000368 HERE'S A MAN WHO COULD HAVE SENT SOMEBODY
YOU0000005256_S0000375 AND I THINK THAT WAS HIM AND IT WAS A WONDERFUL THING AND I SENT BACK TO JOSE ANTONIO MY INTERPRETATION AND JOSE ANTONIO SAID YES
YOU0000005256_S0000389 SOME OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY PARTS OF THIS COLLECTION
YOU0000005256_S0000396 THERE IT IS INSIDE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CYCHRINE A KIND OF A CARABID THAT'S KIND OF RARE A LITTLE SNAIL HUNTER BRILLIANT PURPLE GORGEOUS LITTLE ANIMAL
YOU0000005256_S0000408 AND THEN WE MET AGAIN
YOU0000005256_S0000418 WORLD CLASS QUITE REMARKABLE AND THEN SPENT THE NEXT
YOU0000005256_S0000430 MYANMAR BOTSWANA AND THE ADRIATIC AND OF COURSE IF YOU KNOW DAVID
YOU0000005256_S0000442 THESE REMARKABLE QUALITIES REFLECT THE REASON I'VE CHOSEN THIS ISSUE OF REVISTA
YOU0000005256_S0000451 HOW ABOUT THESE EXTRAORDINARY WEEVILS FROM BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA
YOU0000005256_S0000466 ANOTHER SCARAB
YOU0000005256_S0000474 HE HAD ANOTHER ROOM WITH A MICROSCOPE SET UP THERE WAS A MICROSCOPE SET UP HERE AS WELL
YOU0000005256_S0000488 SO THAT WAS ALL RECRAFTED AFTER GEOFF STARTED
YOU0000005256_S0000502 THEY HAVE THE ARCHITECTURE THE FORM AND THE FUNCTION THEY HAVE ALL OF THESE LAYERS OF COMPLEXITY AND DEPTH THAT THEMSELVES HAVE A CERTAIN BEAUTY
YOU0000005256_S0000507 SO THE REWARD OF COURSE IS A LIFETIME OF FORAGING LOOKING FOR THE THINGS OF INTEREST
YOU0000005256_S0000518 IT'S AESTHETIC BUT IT'S DEEPER THAN THAT TOO ITS MEANING
YOU0000005256_S0000529 CHARLES DARWIN WAS A FAMOUS BEETLE COLLECTOR
YOU0000005256_S0000535 THE DESCENT OF MAN
YOU0000005256_S0000541 AND SO HE LOST TWO OF THE BEETLES HE COULD HAVE HAD TWO HE ENDED UP WITH ONE
YOU0000005256_S0000549 SO BARNACLES ALL OVER THE BOAT HE COULD APPRECIATE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES
YOU0000005256_S0000561 SOMEBODY WHO COLLECTS COSAS THINGS
YOU0000005256_S0000578 MAYBE WE'RE FORTUNATE THAT IN FACT HE DECIDED THAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN PSYCHOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION INSTEAD
YOU0000005256_S0000586 SOMETHING MY MOTHER NOTED IN A KINDERGARTEN REPORT CARD
YOU0000005256_S0000598 AND THEN THEY TOOK BLOOD SAMPLES FROM THEM
YOU0000005256_S0000605 IT MIGHT BE ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT TOUCHES US INSIDE
YOU0000005256_S0000615 SO AT ANY RATE THERE ARE ALL OF THESE VARIOUS EFFECTS ON OUR PSYCHE
YOU0000005256_S0000630 AND THIS MIGHT BE PART OF THE REASON PART OF THE BENEFIT OF PURSUING THESE KINDS OF INTERESTS
YOU0000005256_S0000640 SO WE'RE MUSTERING THIS EXPERTISE THROUGH CITIZEN SCIENTIST PARTICIPATION
YOU0000005256_S0000648 SO THIS MIGHT EVEN INCLUDE THE PLACEBO EFFECT WHICH OF COURSE IS BAD NEWS FOR MEDICINE BUT GREAT NEWS FOR THE REST OF US
YOU0000005256_S0000655 JUST ENCOURAGE AS DAVID'S MOTHER DID FOR HIM AS WE DO WITH OUR CHILDREN
YOU0000005256_S0000665 I THINK ALSO THAT WE NEED THE REASSURANCE OF THE FAMILIAR SIGHTS THE COMPREHENSIBILITY THE ORDER THAT DAVID DESCRIBED SO WELL IN THE WORLD
YOU0000005256_S0000673 AND I THINK IT COULD BE STUDIED IN PLACES LIKE UNIVERSITIES
YOU0000005256_S0000687 THEY'RE SENT ON LOAN TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS AT THE REQUEST OF SCIENTISTS WHO ARE STATIONED THERE INTERESTED IN PARTICULAR GROUPS
YOU0000005256_S0000711 AND IF YOU DIGITIZE THAT
YOU0000005256_S0000734 SO I SENT IT DOWN TO HIM
YOU0000005256_S0000741 KIND OF FUN
YOU0000005256_S0000748 ED IS HERE
YOU0000005256_S0000756 OFFER AN EPILOGUE
YOU0000005256_S0000772 THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY AT THE SMITHSONIAN
YOU0000005256_S0000788 THE LIVING WORLD
YOU0000005256_S0000795 THEY ARE EVEN LESS WELL KNOWN
YOU0000005256_S0000810 WE HAVE WITH ALL OUR EFFORT UP TO THIS POINT
YOU0000005256_S0000818 FIRST IS TO STOP THE MASS EXTINCTIONS OF THE WORLD
YOU0000005256_S0000825 WHOSE SOLUTION WILL BE BIG SCIENCE IT WILL BE GREAT SCIENCE
YOU0000005256_S0000836 AND AS A RESULT OF THAT TRIP
YOU0000005256_S0000847 AND ALL YOU WILL CONTINUE TO DO HERE AT HARVARD AND FOR THE WORLD WELL THANK YOU
YOU0000005264_S0000017 HOWEVER WE WANT TO PRIMARILY BE USING FAT AND KETONES FOR FUEL SOURCE
YOU0000005264_S0000023 THAT WE HAVE BETTER MENTAL CLARITY BETTER COGNITIVE ACCELERATION WERE ABLE TO THINK SHARPLY AND QUICKLY
YOU0000005264_S0000037 THERE'S STILL ENOUGH NUTRITION COMING IN WHERE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE METABOLIZED IN THEIR MUSCLE
YOU0000005264_S0000048 AND THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY HEALTHY FOR OUR BODY AS A SORT OF FEAST FAMINE CYCLE WHEN WE FEAST WE HELP ACTIVATE THYROID HORMONE
YOU0000005264_S0000057 SO WE WANT TO ROTATE BETWEEN THOSE CYCLES AND IF WE'RE CALORIE RESTRICTED FOR TOO LONG
YOU0000005264_S0000075 THE BEST WAY TO DO IS KIND OF LEAN INTO IT RIGHT
YOU0000005264_S0000082 IF YOU'RE EATING FOUR HUNDRED GRAMS OF CARBOHYDRATES A DAY
YOU0000005264_S0000088 YEAH TYPICALLY WITH PATIENTS THAT I RECOMMEND AND I DON'T REALLY CALL IT A KETO I JUST CALL IT I HAVE A PALEO TEMPLATE THAT'S KIND OF MY FOUNDATION AND THEN WE GO LOWER CARB PALEO WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY GOING TO BE KETOGENIC ONCE WE GO BELOW FIFTY OR TWENTY NET CARBS THAT KIND OF GETS THOSE KETONES UP
YOU0000005264_S0000100 I KNOW YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT THAT IN THE SHOW THINGS LIKE DOING APPLE CIDER VINEGAR AND WATER DRINKING GINGER TEA THROUGHOUT THE DAY
YOU0000005264_S0000107 AND YEAH A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MILESTONES SO GALLSTONES IN THEIR IN THEIR GALLBLADDER
YOU0000005264_S0000113 ROUGHLY ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES TO AN HOUR BEFORE YOU EAT A MEAL
YOU0000005264_S0000128 YOU CONNECT A LOT OF THE OTHER SYSTEMS TO IT WHICH IS REALLY GOOD BECAUSE WE KNOW IN FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE
YOU0000005264_S0000138 AND SO WE'VE GOT TO START TO ACTUALLY OPEN UP AND TAKE LONG DEEP BREATHS OUR BODY KNOWS WHEN WE'RE TAKING A LONG DEEP BREATH
YOU0000005264_S0000147 YOU KNOW BUT DOING THAT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
YOU0000005264_S0000166 IF LET'S SAY YOU'RE ONLY EATING A COUPLE OF SERVINGS OF VEGETABLES
YOU0000005264_S0000175 YOU DON'T RETAIN SODIUM SO
YOU0000005264_S0000183 CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES RIGHT THESE ARE ALL GREAT FOODS THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSUMING ON THIS SORT OF A DIET TO GET THE TRACE MINERALS THAT WE NEED
YOU0000005264_S0000194 A KETO TEMPLATE WITH VEGETABLES TO A CARNIVORE KETO TEMPLATE WHEN DOES THAT SWITCH HAPPEN WHEN WE WHY WOULD YOU RECOMMEND IT WHO WOULD THAT PERSON BE THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE KETO VERSION WHICH JUST MEAT
YOU0000005264_S0000202 YOU'RE HAVING BRAIN FOG
YOU0000005264_S0000209 OKAY BUT IN GENERAL
YOU0000005264_S0000216 THAT COULD BE A SIGN THAT AGAIN YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH BILE FLOW
YOU0000005264_S0000225 AND THEN ONCE YOU ADD IN SOME ORGAN MEAT WITH THAT IT'S LIKE WOW
YOU0000005264_S0000235 OKAY SUGAR ITSELF IN OUR SYSTEM ACTS AS AN ANTI NUTRIENT RIGHT WE NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT BUT ONCE WE GET BEYOND THAT
YOU0000005264_S0000243 OKAY AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING LIKE GRASS FED STEAK OKAY OR ORGAN MEATS OBVIOUSLY REALLY NUTRIENT DENSE WILD CAUGHT FISH
YOU0000005264_S0000253 HIGH FIBER HIGH NUTRIENTS
YOU0000005264_S0000258 ESPECIALLY THE EGG YOLK
YOU0000005264_S0000271 YOU KNOW AVOCADOS AND OTHER PLANTS
YOU0000005264_S0000284 AND THEN THEIR POOP ACTUALLY FERTILIZES GROUND RIGHT OR IF YOU HAVE COWS OUT THERE
YOU0000005264_S0000303 THAT CAN BE HAZARDOUS OR CHALLENGING FOR THEIR THEIR PREDATORS TO CONSUME
YOU0000005264_S0000317 WE END UP LOADING UP ON THESE OXALATES WE END UP WITH CHRONIC JOINT PAIN
YOU0000005264_S0000328 YOU CAN DO A PARTIAL FAST AND YOU'LL STILL GET GREAT RESULTS THAT A PARTIAL FAST WOULD BE LIKE DRINKING YOUR CELERY JUICE
YOU0000005264_S0000339 YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IS JUST LIKE ANYTHING YOUR BODY ACTUALLY GETS BETTER AND BETTER AT DOING THIS
YOU0000005264_S0000344 SO I WOULD NORMALLY WAS DOING SOMEWHERE ON EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY HOUR FASTS AND THAT WAS VERY EASY FOR ME AND I WAS DRINKING A LOT OF WATER DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME
YOU0000005264_S0000352 IT'S NOT AS MUCH OF A STRESSOR SO ACTUALLY DO IT LIKE WEDNESDAY IS USUALLY A VERY BUSY DAY FOR ME
YOU0000005264_S0000362 SO YOU GOT LIKE
YOU0000005264_S0000371 AND WHAT'S INTERESTING JUSTIN IS WITH THIS LIFESTYLE
YOU0000005264_S0000383 FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS OKAY
YOU0000005264_S0000388 FOOD IS PREVALENT WE DON'T NEED TO STRESS OUT BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE ALSO IN A FAMINE RIGHT AND WE NEED TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE THIS
YOU0000005264_S0000400 RIGHT YOU NOTICE HEART PALPITATIONS YOU NOTICE LIKE WORSENING FATIGUE A FEW HOURS LATER OR THEY ARE GIVES YOU CRAVINGS
YOU0000005264_S0000405 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND IF YOU DRINK COFFEE AND YOU DIDN'T FEEL GOOD
YOU0000005272_S0000005 RICHARD REGULARLY APPEARS ON EVERY LIST OF THE MOST CITED AND MOST INFLUENTIAL LEGAL SCHOLARS OF THE LAST HALF-CENTURY
YOU0000005272_S0000014 PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD A SECTION OF WALL OR FENCING OR BARRIER AS HE IS NOW CALLING IT ON THE BORDER FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IS ABOUT ONE EIGHT OF ONE PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET
YOU0000005272_S0000019 HE HAS AND I'M QUOTING HIM HERE
YOU0000005272_S0000029 THERE'S A SERIOUS QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL DELEGATION OF EXCESSIVE AUTHORITY TO THE PRESIDENT
YOU0000005272_S0000045 EVEN MOVE MONEY OUT OF CIVIL PROJECTS TO MILITARY PROJECTS
YOU0000005272_S0000059 PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST RECEIVES JOHN YOO'S ADVICE
YOU0000005272_S0000071 AND WHAT HE SAID IS WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS ACTING PURSUANT TO AUTHORIZATION BY CONGRESS HE'S IN VERY FINE SHAPE
YOU0000005272_S0000079 I THINK HE IS AT SERIOUS RISK
YOU0000005272_S0000100 KIM STRASSEL IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTS THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION UNLIKE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS WHEN THERE WERE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS IT WAS REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS FORCING THE SHUTDOWN
YOU0000005272_S0000112 THE QUESTION IS
YOU0000005272_S0000129 AND YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT AN UNATTRACTIVE CLAIM GETTING SOMETHING FOR NOTHING IS WHAT THE TAKINGS CLAUSE IS TO SOME EXTENT DESIGNED TO PREVENT
YOU0000005272_S0000152 AND SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER ARE SUCH CLOSE PERSONAL FRIENDS
YOU0000005272_S0000157 WILLIAM BARR SUBMITTED TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AN UNSOLICITED TWENTY PAGE MEMORANDUM
YOU0000005272_S0000162 WELL
YOU0000005272_S0000167 ON THE OTHER HAND
YOU0000005272_S0000173 WHEN HE WAS THAT BABY ATTORNEY GENERAL
YOU0000005272_S0000184 ON WHICH I THINK TRUMP HAD MANY GROUNDS TO FIRE COMEY
YOU0000005272_S0000288 IT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR
YOU0000005272_S0000300 TAKING FIDELITY TO THE CONSTITUTION AS THE CRITERION
YOU0000005272_S0000306 RICHARD
YOU0000005272_S0000334 AND THE SAME THING WITH CLERKS THESE KIDS ARE ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS
YOU0000005272_S0000344 RICHARD EPSTEIN JOHN YOO
YOU0000005280_S0000009 AND RYSE'S MISSION STATEMENT SAYS IT ALL TO CREATE SAFE SPACES GROUNDED IN SOCIAL JUSTICE THAT BUILD YOUTH POWER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO LOVE
YOU0000005280_S0000014 I AM GOING TO GET US STARTED
YOU0000005280_S0000024 DISTRESSING AND OVERWHELM PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO COPE
YOU0000005280_S0000031 SO IN OUR FIRST WEBINAR WE TALKED ALSO ABOUT HOW SUPPORTIVE AND SIGNIFICANT ADULT RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE A SOURCE OF HEALING AND RECLAMATION OF THAT EMPOWERMENT AND AGENCY FOR THE PERSONS OR PEOPLE AND IN THIS CASE YOUNG PEOPLE WHOM WE SERVE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A TAXED SENSE OF COPING
YOU0000005280_S0000041 IN RESPONSE TO FEELING POWERLESS UNSEEN UNHEARD AND DISENFRANCHISED
YOU0000005280_S0000050 WHAT ARE WE DOING WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW SERVICES ARE CONSTRUCTED DELIVERED AND RECEIVED
YOU0000005280_S0000057 WITH THAT SAID
YOU0000005280_S0000065 SERVICES STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS WAY
YOU0000005280_S0000073 AND I WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE SECOND QUOTE WHICH IS FROM HEALING-CENTERED YOUTH ORGANIZING FROM THE URBAN PEACE MOVEMENT
YOU0000005280_S0000085 AND SO BECAUSE WE CODE WHAT RESILIENCE LOOKS LIKE AND TRAUMA LOOKS LIKE
YOU0000005280_S0000092 AND WITHOUT PSYCHOANALYZING
YOU0000005280_S0000101 AND WHAT SUPPORTS DO YOU NEED WHAT MIGHT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO NURTURE YOUR OWN TRAUMA CAPITAL IT'S A TERM THAT I USE BECAUSE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT HUMAN CAPITAL ECONOMIC CAPITAL SOCIAL CAPITAL
YOU0000005280_S0000107 AND THAT OFTEN WE SEE THAT WE ARE ALWAYS SERVING YOUNG PEOPLE VERSUS YOUNG PEOPLE ALSO SERVING US IN OUR OWN ONGOING RESILIENCE AND HEALING
YOU0000005280_S0000113 SO I'M GOING TO SHOW A COUPLE OF SCHEMAS AROUND HOW WE AS ADULTS WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE CAN REALLY CHECK OUR OWN APPROACH AND PARTNERSHIP IN WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AS THEY NAVIGATE THEIR OWN TRAUMA AND RESILIENCE
YOU0000005280_S0000122 AND IN THE SALMON COLOR ARE THE RUNGS OF YOUTH VOICE THIS IS EXACTLY FROM HART'S LADDER AND WHAT WE DID IS WE CONTEXTUALIZED THEM TO WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IN WELLNESS OR SUPPORT SYSTEMS
YOU0000005280_S0000128 WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE WHEN WE DON'T GET CONSENT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN HOW THEY'RE ACCESSING THEIR SERVICES AND SYSTEMS FOR THEIR OWN HEALING
YOU0000005280_S0000135 OR HART'S LADDER TO CONTEXTUALIZE IT FOR YOUR OWN APPROACHES TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SYSTEMS
YOU0000005280_S0000143 AGAIN
YOU0000005280_S0000153 I'M ALSO CALLING OUT THE ORGANIZATION EDUCATORS FOR FAIR CONSIDERATION
YOU0000005280_S0000162 THIS LINKS BACK TO THE SLIDE EARLIER THAT SHOWED THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ARRIVING AT THEIR LEADERSHIP ONE IS TO BE A RESEARCHER
YOU0000005280_S0000174 IS THAT WE USE THOSE SPECTRUMS AND WE USE OUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT TRAUMA TO ACTUALLY CHECK WHAT PRACTICES AND PROGRAMS WE HAVE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ADEQUATELY SERVING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE WAY THAT THEY NEED TO
YOU0000005280_S0000196 MY FIRST DEPARTMENT IS OUR YOUTH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
YOU0000005280_S0000214 AND TAKE RISK IN HEALTHY WAYS
YOU0000005280_S0000221 WHERE ALL OF THESE VALUES AND PRACTICES BECOME OUR NORMS AND ARE INTEGRATED INTO ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS INSIDE AND OUT OF RYSE
YOU0000005280_S0000227 ONCE AGAIN RYSE WAS CREATED OUT OF YOUTH ORGANIZING SO WE SAW IT AS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO STAY RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY
YOU0000005280_S0000233 WE BELIEVE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE'S VOICES SHOULD BE HEARD AND VALUED IN ALL SYSTEMS INCLUDING SCHOOL SITES
YOU0000005280_S0000238 AND VALIDATE YOUNG PEOPLE'S FEELINGS INCLUDING ANGER
YOU0000005280_S0000245 SO IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT VIOLENCE AND TRAUMA IS ALMOST FAMILIAL TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND SO WE REALLY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO CREATE THOSE SYSTEMIC CHANGES
YOU0000005280_S0000250 FROM OUR LISTENING CAMPAIGN WE DEVELOPED OUR TRAUMA HEALING LEARNING SERIES
YOU0000005280_S0000255 AND YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES IN ORDER TO REALLY GAIN NEW INSIGHT INTO SOME OF THESE PRACTICES
YOU0000005280_S0000262 SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE YOUTH DEVELOPED WAS THAT ADULTS NEED TO HAVE MORE TRAUMA-INFORMED PRACTICES AND MORE SYSTEMS THAT UTILIZE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND HARM ADDICTION PRACTICES AND POLICIES
YOU0000005280_S0000274 WE ALSO GAVE SPACE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO CREATE ART TO CREATE ART AROUND THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO CREATE AN ALTAR
YOU0000005280_S0000279 SO I ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE SERVICES PRE AND POST-RELEASE TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL REENTRY INTO THEIR COMMUNITY
YOU0000005280_S0000289 AND WHAT DOES YOUR WORK IN SCHOOLS LOOK LIKE
YOU0000005280_S0000296 AND THESE KIDS WERE A LOT OF TIMES BEING SENT OUT FOR WILLFUL DEFIANCE
YOU0000005280_S0000309 WE ASKED YOUNG PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANTED AND IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE THAT ALMOST ACROSS THE BOARD THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE PRIORITIZED WAS THAT THEY WANTED TO RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES
YOU0000005280_S0000318 AND SO I THINK THAT THE WORD CHOICE AND AGENCY IS ALSO WEDDED TO THE WORD INFORMED
YOU0000005280_S0000329 SOME OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MEMBERS OF OUR CENTER AND A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW THEM
YOU0000005280_S0000338 IN THAT PREPARING TO SUPPORT OUR WORK FOR OUR YOUTH LIVING WITH CHRONIC TRAUMA
YOU0000005288_S0000047 THE FIFTH OF OUR SEVEN PROJECTS IS THE SCHEMATIC DESIGN AND BUDGET

YOU0000005288_S0001418 THEY HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN EMBEDDED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM
YOU0000005288_S0001444 IT CONTINUES
YOU0000005288_S0001478 NOT ALL SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE ON THE WEEKENDS NOT ALL SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE IN THE EVENINGS
YOU0000005288_S0001529 BUT IT'S NOT AS MUCH OF A PERCENTAGE OF OUR BUSINESS AS IT WAS BEFORE
YOU0000005288_S0001558 THE TREND ISN'T VERY GOOD
YOU0000005288_S0001580 BUT IT IS HAPPENING AT ALL OF THE SPECIALTIES THE REPLACEMENT PHYSICIAN RATE IS NOT THE SAME
YOU0000005288_S0001613 PERMANENT DISABILITY AND HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES
YOU0000005288_S0001622 DISABLING CONDITION IN THIS COUNTRY
YOU0000005288_S0001628 IT INHIBITS YOUR LIFESTYLE AS MUCH AS HAVING END-STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE OR CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
YOU0000005288_S0001640 CAN WE DO ANYTHING TO PREVENT IT
YOU0000005288_S0001667 AND DESERT HELP US EVEN GET A WINDOW ON THE PRIMARY OSTEOARTHRITIS AND WHY WOULD MY BACK BE ACHING AND MY HIP HURTING IF I WAS STANDING UP
YOU0000005288_S0001681 OPPOSED SAME SIGN
YOU0000005288_S0001694 AT THIS TIME WE WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT FROM THE BOARD
YOU0000005288_S0001707 I WENT TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR TWO YEARS AND I WORKED FORTY HOURS A WEEK AT A CALL CENTER SO I COULD MAKE IT TO ISU AND IT WAS STILL BARELY AFFORDABLE
YOU0000005288_S0001719 FORCE THE STATE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EDUCATING ITS YOUNG PEOPLE
YOU0000005288_S0001732 MY GRANDFATHER WAS HOSPITALIZED FIVE TIMES IN TWO YEARS CARING FOR MY GRANDFATHER
YOU0000005288_S0001741 WE SHARE A VISION FOR A MORE JUST AND FAIR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN IWEB
YOU0000005288_S0001748 RIGHT NOW SICK FACULTY YOUR EMPLOYEES
YOU0000005288_S0001764 THEY ALL AGREED THAT THESE DEMANDS WOULD AND COULD BE DONE BY THE TIME WE RETURNED IN THE FALL
YOU0000005288_S0001788 LAST YEAR WE WARNED YOU THAT TUITION HIKES WOULD ONLY MAKE OUR CAMPUS LESS SAFE AND STUDENTS OF COLOR
YOU0000005288_S0001812 SOMEONE YOU'VE HURT AND I IMAGINE THE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY FACULTY STANDING BEHIND ME
YOU0000005296_S0000010 JESSE WAS IN A DARK PLACE
YOU0000005296_S0000017 IT WASN'T LIKE I HADN'T TRIED TO LOSE WEIGHT
YOU0000005296_S0000027 HOW MUCH EFFORT YOU'LL PUT FORTH AND HOW LONG YOU'LL SUSTAIN THAT EFFORT IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES AND FAILURES
YOU0000005296_S0000033 BUT ONLY LIKE TWELVE PERCENT CONFIDENT IN YOUR ABILITY TO DO ANOTHER JESSE WAS STARTING AT A PLACE OF ALMOST ZERO SELF-EFFICACY
YOU0000005296_S0000039 BEAST MODE ENGAGED
YOU0000005296_S0000053 HIT THE GYM SIX DAYS PER WEEK
YOU0000005296_S0000062 JESSE SET HIMSELF SOME ACTION ORIENTED BEHAVIORAL GOALS ONE
YOU0000005296_S0000075 ONE VIDEO I MADE THAT REALLY KIND OF STICKS IN MY MIND IS THE DAY I DID FIFTY LAPS NOW TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS IS A LAP IS JUST WALKED TO THE KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM THAT WAS ONE LAP
YOU0000005296_S0000088 GAVE ME HOPE
YOU0000005296_S0000093 BUT THE BEST REWARDS ARE THOSE THAT HAVE SOME SORT OF EMOTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE
YOU0000005296_S0000102 SUDDENLY JESSE FINDS HIMSELF WANTING TO PUSH HIMSELF MORE THAN EVER BEFORE
YOU0000005296_S0000109 THESE WERE OBVIOUSLY VERY SPECIAL MOMENTS FOR JESSE THAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED FOR MOST OF US TRYING TO MAKE A CHANGE THE REWARDS MIGHT NOT BE SO OBVIOUS IF WE'RE TRYING TO QUIT SMOKING SAY OR EVEN IF WE'RE TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH WE HAVE TO LOSE
YOU0000005296_S0000119 WAS JUST DONE
YOU0000005296_S0000125 AND YET WHAT BEGAN AS FLOPPING AROUND AND EATING JUST TWO LESS QUESADILLAS
YOU0000005296_S0000140 YOU KNOW JUST TO BE MALICIOUS I'M DOING IT BECAUSE I'M A FUCK UP
YOU0000005296_S0000149 INSPIRATIONAL AND HEARTWARMING STORY
YOU0000005296_S0000155 YOU KNOW ALL THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN INSPIRED BY HIS STORY VIEW HIM THE WAY HE'S LOOKING AT IT HE'S IDENTIFYING WITH THE PART OF HIMSELF THAT'S REPETITIVELY FAILED AND LET HIMSELF DOWN WHILE IGNORING THE OTHER PART OF HIMSELF THAT WENT ON AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY
YOU0000005296_S0000161 THEN THAT STUFF CAN END UP BEING A SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY
YOU0000005296_S0000166 YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP HIM OUT A LITTLE BIT OR MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD OR WHATEVER
YOU0000005304_S0000006 THROUGHOUT THIS TALK
YOU0000005304_S0000011 AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S BEEN A TINY BIT OF IMPROVEMENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE
YOU0000005304_S0000016 WE SEE A REALLY DEPRESSING PICTURE
YOU0000005304_S0000022 WHO MAKE THEIR LIVELIHOOD WORRYING ABOUT EDUCATION POLICY TRYING TO IMPROVE IT
YOU0000005304_S0000027 BUT OVERALL
YOU0000005304_S0000034 ALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF THEM DO JUST FINE
YOU0000005304_S0000043 WHEN WE DIG DOWN WHAT WE FIND OUT IS THAT STUDENTS SPEND ALMOST HALF OF THE SIX MONTHS THAT IS OF THE YEAR FIVE HUNDRED HOURS ON ASSIGNMENTS THAT SIMPLY WEREN'T AT THEIR GRADE LEVEL
YOU0000005304_S0000048 I'M SPEAKING TO YOU FROM BALTIMORE
YOU0000005304_S0000054 NOW SINCE SONJA SANTELISES THE SUPERINTENDENT HAS TAKEN OVER
YOU0000005304_S0000059 ELEVEN PERCENT OF STUDENTS ARE REALLY PROFICIENT
YOU0000005304_S0000064 WHY IS ALL OF THIS HAPPENING
YOU0000005304_S0000071 THEIR CHILDREN ARE ABSOLUTELY AS BADLY OFF ON ANY MEASURE AS THE TEN PERCENT OF POOREST AMERICAN CHILDREN
YOU0000005304_S0000076 FIRST OF ALL
YOU0000005304_S0000081 WELL IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE FIRST OF ALL
YOU0000005304_S0000087 WE DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE IN MERIT AS MUCH AS WE DO IN STATUS IN TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE ROUTES TO THE BEST EDUCATION ARE RESTRICTED TO THE CHILDREN OF FOLKS LIKE US
YOU0000005304_S0000092 FOR EXAMPLE
YOU0000005304_S0000099 JANITORS SECURITY GUARDS HOME HELP
YOU0000005304_S0000105 SO
YOU0000005304_S0000111 IT IS NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL POLITICIANS TO HAVE AN EDUCATED CITIZENRY
YOU0000005304_S0000117 YOU WOULD THINK
YOU0000005304_S0000122 AFTER ALL DOESN'T IT MAKE SENSE TO PREPARE TEACHERS TO TEACH THE MATERIAL THAT THEY WILL TEACH IN SCHOOLS AND THEN ASSESS CHILDREN ON THE MATERIALS THEY'VE LEARNED
YOU0000005304_S0000131 MOST STUDENTS WHEN THEY FACE TESTS FOR STAKES
YOU0000005304_S0000136 BUT THERE'S SOMETHING WORSE THAN THAT
YOU0000005304_S0000141 NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF AMERICAN TEACHERS CREATE CURRICULUM AS THEY GO ALONG
YOU0000005304_S0000146 IN OTHER WORDS TEACHERS ARE CREATING THEIR OWN INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND TESTS ARE BASED ON THE IDEA THAT THEY WILL TEST SKILLS
YOU0000005304_S0000152 THEY HAVE TO WRITE AN ESSAY ABOUT THOSE READINGS
YOU0000005304_S0000158 YES YOU HAVE TEXTS YOU'RE STUDYING
YOU0000005304_S0000166 IT'S STAGGERING
YOU0000005304_S0000171 CERTAINLY
YOU0000005304_S0000176 AND I WILL ADAPT IT IN MY ACTING
YOU0000005304_S0000181 AND WE'LL SEE ONE LATER
YOU0000005304_S0000186 THEY WENT THROUGH YEARS OF MASTERING THE BEST WAY TO DO THE FUNDAMENTALS TO USE RECIPES
YOU0000005304_S0000191 AND I WANT TO TAKE THE LID OFF THE POT THIS IS THE LOUISIANA CURRICULUM
YOU0000005304_S0000196 THIS IS ABOUT ENSURING IN THIS CASE A LESSON ON ROMEO AND JULIET THAT THE TEACHER IS ASKING PROBING RIGOROUS QUESTIONS
YOU0000005304_S0000201 SO NOT ONLY IS YOUR STUDENT YOUR CHILD GETTING AN EDUCATION COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON WHO THE TEACHER HAPPENS TO BE
YOU0000005304_S0000210 ART LEVINE WAS PRESIDENT OF ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AT SCHOOLS IN NEW YORK
YOU0000005304_S0000216 THAT MAY SOUND CRUEL AND UNFAIR
YOU0000005304_S0000225 THAT MISSION IS SECONDARY
YOU0000005304_S0000231 THIS IS HOW WE TAUGHT MEDICAL SCIENCES IN THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY S BEFORE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY TOOK THE LEAD IN TRANSFORMING MEDICAL EDUCATION INTO A CLINICAL ENDEAVOR
YOU0000005304_S0000239 BUT THE COVID NINETEEN SITUATION IN WHICH OVERNIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAD TO TRANSITION FROM FACE TO FACE TO SOME KIND OF ONLINE HYBRID READING PACKET-BASED LEARNING
YOU0000005304_S0000245 WHAT THIS ESSENTIALLY SUMS UP IS THE PREDICTED LOSS OF LEARNING THAT OCCURRED AND HAS OCCURRED THROUGH COVID NINETEEN
YOU0000005304_S0000253 EACH YEAR THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE IN SCHOOL THEY LEARN LESS
YOU0000005304_S0000259 SADLY BECAUSE THE EIGHTH GRADERS WILL HAVE LEARNED LESS AND SO HAVE LESS TO FORGET
YOU0000005304_S0000265 BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING AGAIN THAT I STARTED WITH
YOU0000005304_S0000270 SO MANY OF THEM WHO ARE POORER
YOU0000005304_S0000277 BELIEVE THAT THEIR DEAR CHILD IS AT OR ABOVE GRADE LEVEL
YOU0000005304_S0000282 NOW YOU MIGHT THINK THAT GIVEN THE INEQUALITIES IN OUR SOCIETY GIVEN THE FACT THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HISPANICS SUFFER FROM TRAGIC ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AS DO POOR WHITE CHILDREN
YOU0000005304_S0000288 WE LARGELY LIE TO OUR CHILDREN OF COLOR UNTIL THE ASSESSMENT HAPPENS
YOU0000005304_S0000293 VALEDICTORIANS IN SCHOOLS IN INNER CITIES ARE IN REMEDIATION AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THE MESSAGES THEY GOT

YOU0000005304_S0000397 DO YOU THINK PARENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR CHILDREN'S LEARNING HAVE SHIFTED AFTER THESE MONTHS OF REMOTE LEARNING I HOPE SO
YOU0000005304_S0000403 BUT WE DON'T KNOW YET WHETHER OVERALL PARENTS ARE SAYING TO THEMSELVES GOSH
YOU0000005304_S0000410 WE TEST SCIENCE OCCASIONALLY
YOU0000005304_S0000415 ELA AND MATH REQUIRED TESTING GRADES THREE THROUGH EIGHT AND HIGH SCHOOL
YOU0000005304_S0000422 THERE ARE STUDENTS WHOSE EXPOSURE TO THE ARTS CHANGES THEIR LIFE
YOU0000005304_S0000430 RESEARCH SHOWS THAT REMEDIATION IN THAT WAY OFTEN CALLED RESPONSE TO INTERVENTION
YOU0000005304_S0000435 NOT SEGREGATE THEM AND SAY TO THEM

YOU0000005304_S0000453 WE'VE WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT OVERNIGHT
YOU0000005304_S0000461 IT'S WHY EVEN THE STATES ARE VERY VERY RELUCTANT TO PUSH A CURRICULUM
YOU0000005304_S0000466 JOHN WHITE WHO JUST STEPPED DOWN AS THE COMMISSIONER IN LOUISIANA SHOWED THAT WORKING WITH TEACHERS
YOU0000005304_S0000477 IF LOUISIANA STICKS WITH ITS CURRENT REFORMS
YOU0000005304_S0000484 THESE ARE THE MOST CHALLENGED EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE COUNTRY WHY BECAUSE THEY HAVE VERY HIGH POVERTY RATES DEEP POVERTY HIGH RATES OF DEEP POVERTY AND RACIAL ISSUES RED LINING THE INHERITANCE OF EVERYTHING WE FACE
YOU0000005304_S0000491 CAN YOU EXPAND ON JUST IN TIME ACCESS TO GRADE LEVEL MATERIALS
YOU0000005304_S0000503 NO DOUBT THERE ARE ISSUES RIGHT IS THERE STILL TIME FOR SUMMER SCHOOL YES
YOU0000005304_S0000509 HERE ARE SOME CRUCIAL SKILLS YOU MIGHT HELP THEM WITH
YOU0000005304_S0000518 UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO SEND DIFFERENT MESSAGES THEY'LL GET DIFFERENT SCHOOLING
YOU0000005304_S0000524 AN IMPOVERISHED SCHOOL DISTRICT HOW CAN IT POSSIBLY TAX ITSELF HIGH ENOUGH TO CREATE THE FUNDS FOR SCHOOLS
YOU0000005304_S0000535 IT REALLY MEANS BREAKING DOWN A BIGGER WOOLLY TARGET INTO SMALLER
YOU0000005304_S0000540 BUDGETS
YOU0000005304_S0000551 AS A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR
YOU0000005304_S0000563 SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I HOPE WE'RE IN TOUCH AGAIN

YOU0000005316_S0000036 OH NO HONEY
YOU0000005324_S0000012 BUT FOR THIS ROOM IN THIS MOMENT
YOU0000005324_S0000025 HE'S A GRADUATE OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY
YOU0000005324_S0000032 THE CHALLENGE WE FACE NOW IS HOW TO MAINTAIN THE BENEFITS OF BREATH
YOU0000005324_S0000038 IF THAT IS THE CHALLENGE THEN I WOULD SAY INDEED THAT RANGE ANSWERS THE QUESTION
YOU0000005324_S0000048 HOW TO BECOME SOMEBODY WHO TAKES IN MANY MANY EXPERIENCES AND SOLVES PROBLEMS
YOU0000005324_S0000053 BUT THE DATA SORT OF SNEAKS IN
YOU0000005324_S0000058 I'M GOING THE CALL THEM PROMPTS OUT OF THE BOOK
YOU0000005324_S0000065 AND SO I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN INFLUENCED BY HER
YOU0000005324_S0000070 THE IDEA IS WE NEED TO KEEP PRACTICING A CERTAIN THING PRACTICING PRACTICING
YOU0000005324_S0000080 THEY GAIN BROAD GENERAL SKILLS EARLY ON THAT SCAFFOLD THESE LATER TECHNICAL SKILLS
YOU0000005324_S0000089 WELL TELL THE STORY OF THE FIREMEN WHO DO REPETITION ALL THE TIME
YOU0000005324_S0000111 AND THEY DIDN'T JUST GO UP THEY WENT UP WHERE THEY WERE LEAST EXPECTED TO GO UP
YOU0000005324_S0000123 IT WAS JUST ADAPTED TO A DIFFERENT SITUATION WHERE THEY HAD TO RELY ON VERY CONCRETE EXPERIENCE SO THEY WOULD BE ASKED SOMETHING
YOU0000005324_S0000133 RIGHT SO IF YOU SEE THE FLYNN EFFECT NOT PROGRESSING THE SAME FOR MEN AND WOMEN
YOU0000005324_S0000142 A SCIENTIST WHO
YOU0000005324_S0000155 WHICH IS NOW ITS OWN SPECIALTY BUT WAS AT THE TIME OF BOLD HYBRID AND THEN IN HIS FIFTY S HE BECOMES A GENETICIST
YOU0000005324_S0000174 THESE GIRLS FROM MODEST FAMILIES WHO MEET IN A CHURCH BASEMENT AND FRANCES SAYS
YOU0000005324_S0000196 ADDS ENORMOUS DIVERSITY SHE'S TOLD WHEN SHE GETS THERE
YOU0000005324_S0000211 AND I REALIZED I'VE BEEN LEANING ON DIALOG IN A LAZY WAY WHEN I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING IN MY BOOK TO LET SOMEONE ELSE JUST ANOTHER SCIENTIST JUST EXPLAIN IT
YOU0000005324_S0000222 A WHOLE NEW WAY MEANING
YOU0000005324_S0000227 AND I KEEP THINKING I KEEP GOING BACK TO THE FACT THE WAY YOU TELL THE STORY
YOU0000005324_S0000232 BUT THE SYNTHESIS OF IT ALL REALLY COMES IN YOUR BOOK I THINK AND SHE SHOULD I'M SURE SHE MUST LOVE YOUR BOOK
YOU0000005324_S0000250 AND SOME OF THE GIRLS STARTED TRYING TO LEARN ALL OF THEM
YOU0000005324_S0000267 BUT THEY DIDN'T I THINK PARTLY BECAUSE THEY WERE WOMEN PARTLY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE FAMILIES
YOU0000005324_S0000274 BUT WE HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES LEFT AND I THINK IT'D BE FUN FOR PEOPLE TO ASK QUESTIONS SO
YOU0000005324_S0000284 DESIRE TO MAJOR IN ENGLISH OR HISTORY OR ANY OF WHAT I CONSIDER LIBERAL ARTS
YOU0000005324_S0000295 SO THEY HAVE A BROADER VIEW OF WHAT'S OUT THERE
YOU0000005324_S0000300 YOU KNOW SO I THINK IF WE THOUGHT ABOUT CAREERS LIKE DATING WE WOULDN'T PRESSURE PEOPLE TO PICK SO EARLY
YOU0000005324_S0000306 BUT ONE OF THE I THINK TO ME ONE OF THE THEMES OF MY BOOK IS THAT SOMETIMES THE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO CAUSE THE MOST RAPIDLY APPARENT SHORT TERM PROGRESS UNDERMINE YOUR LONG TERM DEVELOPMENT
YOU0000005324_S0000324 YOU BROUGHT UP CHESS
YOU0000005324_S0000333 MALCOLM AND WE WERE ON A PANEL IN MARCH
YOU0000005324_S0000350 AND SAID CHESS DOESN'T MATTER THE POINT IS I'M SHOWING THAT ANY KID CAN BECOME

YOU0000005324_S0000362 HE WAS A MORE PRODUCTIVE CARRIER OF TYPHOID THAN EVEN TYPHOID MARRYING
YOU0000005324_S0000379 SO WHEN THE ATM WAS INVENTED FOR EXAMPLE THE IDEA WAS BANK TELLERS WOULD ALL GO OUT OF BUSINESS OVERNIGHT AND IN FACT

YOU0000005388_S0000158 WHEN HE BRING WOOD BUT NOT ALL THE TIME
YOU0000005388_S0000170 SO LIKE THEY CAN LIVE LONGER
YOU0000005388_S0000184 IF
YOU0000005388_S0000198 IT'S NOT PART OF OUR
YOU0000005388_S0000203 BUT YOU KNOW
YOU0000005388_S0000219 THE DYSFUNCTION IS FROM
YOU0000005388_S0000226 GOOD CITIZEN AND I'LL BE REWARDED
YOU0000005388_S0000232 THERE IS NO JUSTICE IN THAT
YOU0000005388_S0000238 THAT'S NOT WHO I BELIEVED IN
YOU0000005388_S0000247 WELL AT THAT TIME ALCOHOL WAS INTRODUCED TO US
YOU0000005388_S0000258 YEAH NO I THE GENOCIDE HAS CONTINUED
YOU0000005388_S0000264 AND SO MY COUSINS PUT ME IN THE MIDDLE
YOU0000005388_S0000271 OTHER
YOU0000005388_S0000279 YOU KNOW
YOU0000005388_S0000285 AND THEN EVENTUALLY THEY WERE PUT ON RESERVATIONS AND NOT ALLOWED TO PRACTICE OUR CEREMONIES
YOU0000005388_S0000291 BUT THAT SPIRIT OF THAT TRAUMA THROUGH THESE CEREMONIES IS WIPED OFF OF US
YOU0000005388_S0000297 AND THEY CALL IT INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA NOW
YOU0000005388_S0000312 THE DAY BEFORE I KILLED MYSELF
YOU0000005388_S0000319 THERE WAS A SUICIDE
YOU0000005388_S0000326 AND SOMETIMES I BLAME MYSELF FOR IT
YOU0000005388_S0000333 AFTER DOING ALL THAT SHE FINALLY FOUND HERSELF AFTER CRYING SCREAMING
YOU0000005388_S0000338 I'M STILL HERE
YOU0000005388_S0000358 SO IT'S ALL THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD
YOU0000005388_S0000364 AND THEN TO GIVE THEM THE UNDERSTANDING AND THE STRENGTH TO CARRY ON AND DO WHAT IT IS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO
YOU0000005388_S0000372 ONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE PLAN ON DOING
YOU0000005388_S0000386 BE HERE AND HANG OUT AND HAVE FUN
YOU0000005388_S0000396 ALL THEY NEED IS A LITTLE PUSH A LITTLE NUDGE
YOU0000005388_S0000411 WHY THE ANIMALS WHO THEY ARE WHAT KINDA SPIRIT THEY HAVE
YOU0000005388_S0000418 BECAUSE HE'S HE CAN FLY THE HIGHEST AND GO INTO THE HEAVEN TO TALK TO HIM
YOU0000005388_S0000425 SO WHEN I SEE A EAGLE
YOU0000005388_S0000430 SO IT GIVES THOSE KIDS A
YOU0000005388_S0000440 WHATEVER HAS LIFE GOD
YOU0000005388_S0000449 TAKE COURAGE AND
YOU0000005388_S0000471 WITHOUT PRAYER
YOU0000005388_S0000480 PRAYER IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST
YOU0000005388_S0000490 FOR FOR ME IT'S VERY HARD BECAUSE I GO DAYS FOUR DAYS WITHOUT DRINKING OR EATING ANYTHING
YOU0000005388_S0000498 AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT IT IT HUMBLED ME
YOU0000005388_S0000510 BECAUSE IT IS LIKE
YOU0000005388_S0000516 THEN THEIR DECISION-MAKING SKILLS WOULD BE BETTER
YOU0000005388_S0000537 YOU KNOW TODAY WE'RE FIGHTING DIFFERENT BATTLES THAN OUR ANCESTORS DID LIKE WITH OUR CLUSTER OF SUICIDES IT WAS LIKE HOPELESSNESS HOPELESSNESS
YOU0000005388_S0000544 LIKE A LOT OF EM ARE PURSUING COLLEGE A LOT MORE THEY'RE I JUST SEE A MOVE BACK TOWARDS
YOU0000005388_S0000550 FOR THE SURROUNDINGS
YOU0000005388_S0000557 A LOT MORE THAN JUST PROTECTING YOUR OWN SKIN COLOR
YOU0000005388_S0000563 THEY ARE WARRIORS
YOU0000005388_S0000571 I REALLY LIKE I LOVE HELPING PEOPLE THEN I LOVE MAKING PEOPLE HAPPY
YOU0000005388_S0000585 AND SOME OF THE ELDERS SAY THAT THE ONLY REASON WHY
YOU0000005388_S0000595 WITH THEM
YOU0000005388_S0000601 WE'LL BE STRONG AGAIN SOMEDAY
YOU0000005388_S0000642 GREEN-EYED LAKOTA BOY IT'S A GOOD DAY TO DIE
YOU0000005396_S0000025 DELMONICO
YOU0000005396_S0000031 DEATH
YOU0000005396_S0000039 LOOKING AT HIS MONITOR AND THINKING NO WONDER HE DIDN'T FIND THIS
YOU0000005396_S0000050 I WAS WORKING AT NOVEL AND I WAS ACTUALLY ON THE FRONT LINES OF SUPPORT PROVIDING TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR ALL THE NOVEL PRODUCTS
YOU0000005396_S0000065 WE HAD X EIGHT SIX
YOU0000005396_S0000072 THINGS WERE A BIT FRAGILE THEN
YOU0000005396_S0000094 TO THIS DAY I TRY TO FLY THAT AIRLINE TO MAKE UP FOR ALL THEIR PAIN
YOU0000005396_S0000105 WHEN I WENT TO ONE OF THE SHIP PARTIES WHILE HALF THE DEV TEAM WAS JUMPING IN THE FOUNTAIN I FINALLY MET THIS SMARTASS DEVELOPER HE TALKS A BIG GAME NOW AND NOW WE'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR FOURTEEN YEARS
YOU0000005396_S0000115 KEN HAD A SAYING
YOU0000005396_S0000125 BACK THEN OUR TERM FOR BEING ON THE ROAD
YOU0000005396_S0000143 WE SHOULD SHIP A PRODUCT THAT WORKS MORE OFTEN AND THEN THE FUNNIEST PART WAS THAT I MADE BRADY SAY IT ONSTAGE TO ALL OF OUR ATTENDEES
YOU0000005396_S0000154 FIX IT
YOU0000005396_S0000167 BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THAT
YOU0000005396_S0000174 BUT WHAT'S EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE IS BRETT WAS THE JUNIOR DEVELOPER ON THIS PROJECT AND HIS BOSS GOT STUCK IN CUSTOMS WITH AN EXPIRED PASSPORT
YOU0000005396_S0000180 ALTHOUGH HE NEVER ADMITTED IT TO ME
YOU0000005396_S0000186 DOYLE STOOD UP AND SAID DAVE I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU IN PANTS BEFORE
YOU0000005396_S0000203 THOSE WIZARDS ARE TOO POWERFUL FOR ME
YOU0000005396_S0000213 CAN WE AFFORD TO RIP ALL THIS OUT AND START OVER
YOU0000005396_S0000223 THE GOAL WAS FOR US TO GET IT RIGHT HERE FIRST SO THAT WE WERE THE ONES EXPERIENCING THE PROBLEMS AND NOT OUR CUSTOMERS
YOU0000005396_S0000246 EVEN THOUGH WHEN I CAME I WAS GONNA LEAVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I HAVE NOT LOOKED AROUND STILL
YOU0000005396_S0000254 FOR TWENTY YEARS
YOU0000005396_S0000263 I WAS ONE AND A HALF YEARS OLD WHEN THE PROJECT STARTED I WAS FOUR MONTHS OLD WHEN THEY STARTED WRITING THE CODE
YOU0000005396_S0000283 WE'RE EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT THEM AND PUBLISH THEM FOR OTHERS TO HEAR AS WELL
YOU0000005406_S0000012 THE UNIVERSE IS OF COURSE A VERY COMPLICATED PLACE
YOU0000005406_S0000022 IS ISOTROPY
YOU0000005406_S0000036 WHICH IS REALLY THE FURTHEST OBJECT THAT WE CAN LOOK AT
YOU0000005406_S0000044 ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS
YOU0000005406_S0000050 THEY'RE CONSTANTLY MOVING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT
YOU0000005406_S0000061 AND THAT MEANS THAT LIGHT TRAVELS FROM MY FACE TO YOUR EYES ON STRAIGHT LINES AND ALLOWS YOU TO SEE AN IMAGE OF WHAT MY FACE LOOKS LIKE AND VICE VERSA BY THE WAY
YOU0000005406_S0000067 SO THESE PHOTONS HAVE FOR THE MOST PART BEEN TRAVELLING ON PERFECTLY-STRAIGHT LINES SINCE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AFTER THE BIG BANG
YOU0000005406_S0000077 WHICH IS
YOU0000005406_S0000093 BUT IT'S EVEN STRONGER THAN THAT
YOU0000005406_S0000101 THE EFFECT
YOU0000005406_S0000111 THEN WHAT WE FIND IS THAT THE RESIDUAL DEVIATIONS
YOU0000005406_S0000126 HOMOGENEITY IS HARDER TO TEST WITH PRECISION BECAUSE IT MEANS LOOKING OUT INTO SPACE AND TRYING TO SEE FOR EXAMPLE IF THE DENSITY OF GALAXIES IS UNIFORM AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE
YOU0000005406_S0000131 ONE HAS TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE GALAXY DISTRIBUTION VARIES WITH DISTANCE
YOU0000005406_S0000137 THERE IS OF COURSE
YOU0000005406_S0000145 THEY ARE HOWEVER DISTINCT CONCEPTS LOGICALLY
YOU0000005406_S0000154 PREFERRED DIRECTION FIXED BY THE DIRECTION OF THE PERIODICITY
YOU0000005406_S0000164 VERY GOOD VERY GOOD
YOU0000005406_S0000174 BUT WOULD NOT BE HOMOGENEOUS
YOU0000005406_S0000183 HOMOGENEITY
YOU0000005406_S0000191 SO I THINK SCIENTISTS WOULD BE VERY LOATHED TO IMAGINE THE UNIVERSE THAT LOOK LIKE THIS BUT IT DOES HELP TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE WORDS MEAN
YOU0000005406_S0000202 I SHOULD MAYBE JUST
YOU0000005406_S0000210 SURFACES ARE VERY GOOD EXAMPLES OF NON-EUCLIDEAN TWO-DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRIES
YOU0000005406_S0000218 WHICH IS BASICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY HUBBLE'S LAW
YOU0000005406_S0000230 IN KILOMETERS PER SECOND PER MEGAPARSEC
YOU0000005406_S0000242 AND A PARSEC IS DEFINED BY THAT DIAGRAM
YOU0000005406_S0000249 I'LL WRITE THESE THINGS ON THE BOARD
YOU0000005406_S0000255 THEN THE USEFUL EQUALITY IS THAT ONE
YOU0000005406_S0000262 PER MEGAPARSEC
YOU0000005406_S0000274 IN PHYSICS IN PRINCIPLE
YOU0000005406_S0000283 KILOMETERS PER SECOND PER MEGAPARSEC
YOU0000005406_S0000295 INVERSE TIMES
YOU0000005406_S0000304 THE DATA HE HAD HE DECIDED WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REACH THAT CONCLUSION
YOU0000005406_S0000312 NOT GETTING HIS UNITS RIGHT
YOU0000005406_S0000324 AT LEAST FOR MODERATE DISTANCES
YOU0000005406_S0000339 FORTY S THROUGH SIXTY S
YOU0000005406_S0000349 VALUES STARTED TO BECOME MORE PRECISE
YOU0000005406_S0000358 CEPHEID VARIABLES ARE CRUCIAL TO DETERMINING THE COSMOLOGICAL DISTANCE SCALE
YOU0000005406_S0000372 SO TAMMANN AND SANDAGE THE SAME YEAR USING THE SAME INSTRUMENT
YOU0000005406_S0000380 SATELLITE CALLED THE WILKINSON
YOU0000005406_S0000391 THE SAME WMAP SATELLITE TEAM
YOU0000005406_S0000402 EQUATING TWO DIFFERENT TYPES THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER
YOU0000005406_S0000409 RELATION THAT WOULD GIVE IT
YOU0000005406_S0000428 THE ABSTRACT OF THE PLANCK PAPER USE WORDS SOMETHING LIKE THERE'S A TENSION BETWEEN THEIR VALUE AND OTHER RECENT VALUES
YOU0000005406_S0000441 I DON'T KNOW
YOU0000005406_S0000448 WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THEY WERE WAY OFF
YOU0000005406_S0000455 AND TO A VERY GOOD DEGREE OF RELIABILITY
YOU0000005406_S0000460 SEVENTY VERSUS FIVE HUNDRED
YOU0000005406_S0000469 PROBLEMS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BIG BANG THEORY
YOU0000005406_S0000480 BALANCING AGAINST THE NORMAL ATTRACTIVE GRAVITY OF ORDINARY MATTER
YOU0000005406_S0000494 BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE CASE
YOU0000005406_S0000500 WE WOULD EQUALLY WELL ATTRIBUTE THE STATE OF BEING AT REST TO THAT OTHER GALAXY
YOU0000005406_S0000509 BUT SUPPOSE WE WERE LIVING IN GALAXY B AND CONSIDERED GALAXY B TO BE AT REST
YOU0000005406_S0000520 WHAT WE DO IN ALL CASES IS JUST ADD A VELOCITY V TO THE LEFT TO EACH VELOCITY
YOU0000005406_S0000527 WE GET THREE V TO THE LEFT
YOU0000005406_S0000533 IN FACT IT DOES DESCRIBE A COMPLETELY HOMOGENEOUS PICTURE
YOU0000005406_S0000541 EACH PICTURE WOULD JUST BE A BIGGER IMAGE OF THE SAME PICTURE WITH ONE IMPORTANT EXCEPTION
YOU0000005406_S0000549 AND THAT WOULD JUST UNIFORMLY EXPAND EVERY MOLECULE AND MOVE AWAY FROM EVERY OTHER MOLECULE ON AVERAGE
YOU0000005406_S0000559 BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO MARK SPACE
YOU0000005406_S0000572 GLOBALLY AT LEAST
YOU0000005406_S0000584 SHORTLY AFTER THE BIG BANG AS AN ALMOST PERFECTLY UNIFORM GAS
YOU0000005406_S0000594 YOU EVENTUALLY HAVE HUGE CLUMPS OF MATTER WHICH ARE GALAXIES
YOU0000005406_S0000606 OH THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT
YOU0000005406_S0000615 ONCE WE KNOW THAT THE EXPANSION IS UNIFORM THIS WAY
YOU0000005406_S0000625 AND THAT'S THE KIND OF COORDINATE SYSTEM THAT WE WILL BE USING AND THESE ARE CALLED COMOVING COORDINATES
YOU0000005406_S0000634 PHYSICAL DISTANCE
YOU0000005406_S0000639 THAT WE'LL BE USING FOR THE REST OF THE COURSE TO DESCRIBE THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE
YOU0000005406_S0000649 BETWEEN ANY TWO POINTS ON THE MAP
YOU0000005406_S0000657 IS TO THINK OF BOTH THE COORDINATE DISTANCE AND THE PHYSICAL DISTANCES BEING MEASURED IN NORMAL DISTANCE UNITS
YOU0000005406_S0000665 THE NOTCHES GROW WITH THE PHYSICAL SIZE OF THE PAGE
YOU0000005406_S0000677 AND THEN THE SCALE FACTOR
YOU0000005406_S0000683 SO YOU HAVE A NICE DIMENSIONAL CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NOTCHES DROP OUT OF ANY PHYSICAL CALCULATION THAT YOU TRY TO DO
YOU0000005406_S0000691 SOME DISTANCE OUT IN SPACE
YOU0000005406_S0000701 TIMES A OF T
YOU0000005406_S0000708 WHICH IS ITSELF GOING TO BE A FUNCTION OF TIME
YOU0000005406_S0000720 NOWADAYS ALMOST EVERYBODY CALLS THIS SCALE FACTOR LITTLE A
YOU0000005406_S0000729 NOWADAYS ALMOST EVERYBODY CALLS THE SCALE FACTOR LITTLE A
YOU0000005406_S0000735 AND THAT TURNED OUT TO BE EASY
YOU0000005406_S0000750 WE KNOW THE SPEED OF LIGHT IN METERS PER SECOND
YOU0000005406_S0000755 IT IS JUST C DIVIDED BY A OF T
YOU0000005406_S0000764 AND WE GET NOTCHES
YOU0000005406_S0000776 EXPANDING COORDINATE SYSTEM
YOU0000005406_S0000785 SO THAT'S THE ONLY FACTOR THAT APPEARS AND THIS IS COMPLETELY RIGOROUS ONE CAN DRIVE THIS IN A MORE GENERAL CONTEXT IN GENERAL RELATIVITY
YOU0000005406_S0000799 BUT WE HAVE THE FURTHER COMPLICATION THAT THE DIFFERENT CLOCKS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH ARE CLOCKS CARRIED BY THESE OBSERVERS THAT ARE STATIONARY IN OUR COMOVING COORDINATE SYSTEM
YOU0000005406_S0000807 WHAT WE'RE
YOU0000005406_S0000813 AS AN EXAMPLE
YOU0000005406_S0000823 THEN WE COULD JUST TELL EACH OTHER LET'S ALL SET OUR CLOCKS TO NOON WHEN THE HUBBLE EXPANSION RATE IS FIVE HUNDRED KILOMETERS PER SECOND PER MEGAPARSEC
YOU0000005406_S0000828 NONE OF US COULD SEE ANYTHING DIFFERENT AS LONG AS WE'RE MEASURING TIME INTERVALS
YOU0000005406_S0000843 BUT NOTCHES
YOU0000005406_S0000853 MIGHT MENTION IN THE LAST THIRTY SECONDS ONE INTERESTING PHENOMENON
YOU0000005406_S0000862 SO AT LEAST ONE OF THE MECHANISMS I MENTIONED TO SYNCHRONIZE THE CLOCKS GOES AWAY
YOU0000005406_S0000872 SO I'LL STOP THERE
YOU0000005414_S0000010 THE LIFESPAN IN UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES IS
YOU0000005414_S0000016 THERE HAS BEEN A ALMOST ALARMING LACK OF DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ANTIBIOTICS IN THE LAST
YOU0000005414_S0000021 SOME OF THE DRUGS SUDDENLY HUGELY INCREASING IN PRICES BECAUSE OF NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT BUT
YOU0000005414_S0000028 AND SO THEY HAVE TO PRICE THE NEW DRUGS AT VERY HIGH RATES
YOU0000005414_S0000035 EFFICIENTLY AT MUCH LOWER COSTS
YOU0000005414_S0000041 MAYBE SOME OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA WILL FACE THE PROBLEM OF RISING HEALTH COSTS AND
YOU0000005414_S0000049 WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW PRODUCTIVE THE PEOPLE BETWEEN AGE ONE HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED WILL BE
YOU0000005414_S0000056 ONCE THE MACHINES ARE SMART ENOUGH
YOU0000005414_S0000063 BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT WHAT TEACHERS DO WITH CLASSES OF TWENTY TO FORTY PEOPLE
YOU0000005414_S0000071 TYRANNOSAURUS REX TO DO
YOU0000005414_S0000083 FOR EXAMPLE
YOU0000005414_S0000089 A ROM AND THEN BECOME IMMUNE
YOU0000005414_S0000100 DIDN'T I MENTION ARTHUR CLARK'S
YOU0000005414_S0000108 IN ANY CASE THAT WAS THE
YOU0000005414_S0000117 PEOPLE LIKE LARRY NEVIN AND DAVID BRIN AND GREG EGAN AND
YOU0000005414_S0000123 AND
YOU0000005414_S0000132 WRITE AN ARTICLE ON WHAT I SAID ABOUT FUTURE ROBOTS AND
YOU0000005414_S0000142 WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE SCIENCE FICTION WRITER WHO USED TO
YOU0000005414_S0000151 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN BY A MILLION ROBOTS
YOU0000005414_S0000162 ANY OF YOU HAVE HOW MUCH LABOR IS INVOLVED IN
YOU0000005414_S0000262 THE SOLUTION IS TO KILL THE PERSON WHO IS CAUSING THE TROUBLE
YOU0000005414_S0000272 REVIEW OF PUBLICATIONS ABOUT MEMORY
YOU0000005414_S0000277 UNDERSTANDING STORIES
YOU0000005414_S0000288 PSYCHOLOGISTS DIDN'T HAVE
YOU0000005414_S0000294 THEY'RE STARTING TO ADD ALL SORTS OF NEW KINDS OF LINKS TO THE COMMONSENSE KNOWLEDGE BASE
YOU0000005414_S0000308 I GUESS WHEN I TALKED ABOUT THE
YOU0000005414_S0000315 WHAT LITERATURE WOULD CONTAIN
YOU0000005414_S0000322 MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH CHILDREN THAT YOUR GENES SURVIVE
YOU0000005414_S0000338 BECAUSE A PROFESSION IS A IF IT HAS A NAME
YOU0000005414_S0000347 FOR EACH FRAGMENT OF KNOWLEDGE
YOU0000005414_S0000355 BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE SAYING BRUTUS
YOU0000005414_S0000362 SO FOR EACH FRAGMENT OF KNOWLEDGE
YOU0000005414_S0000368 THEN THAT'S A SUB PROBLEM
YOU0000005414_S0000375 ALLOW YOU TO USE KNOWLEDGE THAT DOESN'T QUITE FIT IF YOU CAN CHARACTERIZE
YOU0000005414_S0000381 AND IT DOESN'T QUITE WORK
YOU0000005414_S0000389 AND WE'RE BACK TO THE IDEA THAT SOLVING PROBLEMS IS BY REMOVING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT YOU HAVE AND WHAT YOU WANT
YOU0000005414_S0000394 DOESN'T HAVE
YOU0000005414_S0000399 AND THAT WAS THE HIGHEST RATE
YOU0000005414_S0000404 A MINIMAL BOUNDARY ON EVENT PERCEPTION
YOU0000005414_S0000413 DO SOMETHING FASTER
YOU0000005414_S0000429 LOOK AT SPORTS PEOPLE
YOU0000005414_S0000442 WELL YOU HEAR STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE WHO CAN
YOU0000005414_S0000448 MANY STORIES
YOU0000005414_S0000504 LOOK PRETTY FUNNY
YOU0000005414_S0000515 HOW DIFFERENT THEY ALL ARE
YOU0000005414_S0000524 SURE
YOU0000005414_S0000535 EACH FRAGMENT OF KNOWLEDGE TYPES OF PROBLEMS IT MIGHT HELP TO SOLVE
YOU0000005414_S0000542 WHAT KIND OF CONTEXTUAL CUES IS GOING TO GET IT TO BE RETRIEVED
YOU0000005414_S0000553 THAT RING A BELL
YOU0000005414_S0000633 WELL I GUESS
YOU0000005414_S0000640 WHICH IS WORSE
YOU0000005414_S0000646 BECAUSE THERE'S A WORD IN ENGLISH CALLED QUALITIES
YOU0000005414_S0000655 IN THAT SENSE IRREDUCIBLE
YOU0000005414_S0000661 IF YOU SAY SOMETHING IS IRREDUCIBLE
YOU0000005414_S0000726 WHICH PROTECT THE HIGHER LEVELS OF THINKING FROM THE WEIRD AND UNRELIABLE PROCESSES THAT INDIVIDUAL SYNAPSES AND NERVE CELLS HAVE
YOU0000005414_S0000734 DON'T INTERFERE WITH WHAT IT'S DOING
YOU0000005414_S0000764 QUESTION IS DOES IT SHED LIGHT ON THE THING IF THAT'S THE THING YOU'RE TRYING
YOU0000005414_S0000770 IS THAT THERE'S A FLUID CALLED CONSCIOUSNESS
YOU0000005414_S0000776 AS SUPPOSED TO DRY
YOU0000005414_S0000783 IT LEFT A LITTLE STREAM OF EVAPORATING WATER
YOU0000005414_S0000791 MAYBE WE COULD VERY WELL DO WITHOUT TEN OF THEM
YOU0000005414_S0000798 SO I LOOK AT PEOPLE LISTENING TO MUSIC
YOU0000005414_S0000806 IT UNDERSTANDS CHINESE PERFECTLY
YOU0000005414_S0000817 THAT WORD IS AN ABBREVIATION FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY VARIOUS DIFFERENT THINGS
YOU0000005414_S0000822 AND THEN THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOME THING
YOU0000005414_S0000829 WHY DID THEY THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO GO WITH THAT WORD
YOU0000005414_S0000841 RIGHT SO IT'S INTENDED NOT
YOU0000005414_S0000851 SEARLE'S ROOM ISN'T INTELLIGENT
YOU0000005414_S0000858 THE STUDY OF THE BRAIN IS IRRELEVANT TO THE STUDY OF THE MIND
YOU0000005414_S0000865 WHATEVER IT WAS
YOU0000005414_S0000877 FIT INTO A STORY MODEL
YOU0000005414_S0000891 YOU HAVE A FAVORITE STORY
YOU0000005414_S0000908 FOUR EUROS AND THEN THAT'S HOW I LIKE
YOU0000005414_S0000920 LIKE FALLING ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STORY AND SAYING LIKE
YOU0000005414_S0000993 YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME REASON WHY
YOU0000005414_S0001007 IT SEEMS LIKE

YOU0000005458_S0000312 COMMENT FROM JASON BATES
YOU0000005458_S0000318 WE WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION OPTIONS SHOULD THE DISTRICT REQUIRE DISTANCE LEARNING AND NOT ALLOW FOR ADEQUATE SOCIALIZATION AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE PLAYTIME IN THE FALL
YOU0000005458_S0000325 ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US WITH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS WE HAVE A FIRST GRADER
YOU0000005458_S0000333 I WOULD ALSO LIKE THE DISTRICT TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS BE GIVEN FLEXIBILITY AND DISCRETION WITHIN THE TIER TWO PLAN TO OPERATE THEIR SCHOOLS GIVEN THE INDIVIDUALIZED NEEDS AT EACH SCHOOL AND THE WISHES OF THE FAMILIES
YOU0000005458_S0000341 I FEEL BEING AT SCHOOL GETTING FACE TIME WITH THE TEACHER EVERY DAY IS SO IMPORTANT AND WILL HELP WITH CONSISTENCY FOR THESE KIDS
YOU0000005458_S0000347 BUT IF MASKS WORK AND EVERYONE WILL BE WEARING THEM THEN I GUESS IT IS A MOOT POINT
YOU0000005458_S0000352 IT SHOULD ALSO NOT BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION
YOU0000005458_S0000358 SO PLEASE LET US HAVE OUR SCHOOL SOCIAL BUBBLES EVEN IF IT'S JUST FOR HALF A DAY
YOU0000005458_S0000366 SPACES WERE ALREADY CROWDED AND POORLY VENTILATED
YOU0000005458_S0000373 WE KNOW IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR OUR STUDENTS THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR HEARTS ACHED FOR THE ONES WE COULD NOT REACH LIKE WE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO
YOU0000005458_S0000379 IF IT MEANS SAVING OTHERS' HEALTH
YOU0000005458_S0000388 THE CHALLENGES WE ARE FACING ARE OVERWHELMING AND YOUR HARD WORK IS APPRECIATED
YOU0000005458_S0000395 OPTING FOR DISTANCE LEARNING DURING THE PANDEMIC SHOULD NOT RESULT IN LOSS OF ANY LOTTERY SPOT OR APPROVED INTER DISTRICT TRANSFER SPOT
YOU0000005458_S0000400 STUDENT AND STAFF SAFETY SHOULD BE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY WHEN NAVIGATING OPTIONS DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION
YOU0000005458_S0000405 PARENTS TEACHERS WILL IF WE SEND OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL TOO SOON
YOU0000005458_S0000414 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT HEALTH AND SAFETY FIRST
YOU0000005458_S0000420 EVEN THOUGH THEIR EDUCATION AND SERVICES ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
YOU0000005458_S0000425 ALSO YOU NEED TO CUT THE BUSING FOR EARLY COLLEGE STUDENTS
YOU0000005458_S0000430 I WORRY MY CHILDREN A SOPHOMORE AND A SENIOR AT NEWPORT HARBOR HIGH SCHOOL WILL MISS WEEKS OF SCHOOL IF REQUIRED TO SELF QUARANTINE AND THAT THE CLASSES THEY NEED WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE ONLINE

YOU0000005458_S0000442 IF WE PLAN WELL
YOU0000005458_S0000448 THOUGH I'M SUPPOSING THESE THINGS ARE WELL UNDERWAY
YOU0000005458_S0000455 THE CURRENT RATE OF COVID NINETEEN IN THE NEWPORT MESA COMMUNITY IS TOO HIGH TO REOPEN SCHOOLS
YOU0000005458_S0000461 THE CURRENT RATE OF INFECTION CLEARLY POINTS TO DISTANCE LEARNING AT THESE DISRUPTIVE OPTIONS
YOU0000005458_S0000467 IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT MORE STEPS TO MITIGATE RISK ARE PUT IN PLACE
YOU0000005458_S0000472 THERE IS NO BUDGET FOR MASKS OR PLEXIGLASS
YOU0000005458_S0000479 SUCH AS HYBRID OPTIONS THAT ARE MUCH MORE COGNIZANT OF DISTANCING
YOU0000005458_S0000487 IF THIS SEEMS LIKELY PERHAPS THE BOARD SHOULD BE DIRECTING THEIR EFFORTS INTO MAXIMIZING THE VIRTUAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE
YOU0000005458_S0000495 DO WHAT IS BEST FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND RETURN THE STUDENTS TO OUR SCHOOL FULL TIME NOW
YOU0000005458_S0000500 THEY ARE NOT AT RISK NOR ARE THE TEACHERS I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF EDUCATION MY CHILDREN HAVE RECEIVED THESE PAST FEW MONTHS
YOU0000005458_S0000505 IN SUPPORT OF STUDENTS AND TEACHERS SAFETY
YOU0000005458_S0000511 THE GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS QUOTE
YOU0000005458_S0000517 CHILDREN PLAY A VERY MINOR ROLE IN THE SPREAD OF COVID NINETEEN TEACHERS AND STAFF ARE IN GREATER DANGER OF INFECTION FROM OTHER ADULTS INCLUDING PARENTS THAN THE STUDENTS IN THEIR CLASSROOMS
YOU0000005458_S0000522 IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT IS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PROVIDE THAT EDUCATION
YOU0000005458_S0000527 NOT ALLOWED TO BE ON CAMPUS

YOU0000005458_S0000570 I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT ACCORDING TO MASLOV'S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS HOW CAN SAFETY OR BASIC NEEDS REQUIRED AS FOUNDATION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SELF FULFILLMENT NEEDS
YOU0000005458_S0000580 WITH WHAT WE KNOW NOW OUR TEACHERS AT LEAST THE ONES WHO CHOOSE TO GO BACK SHOULD FEEL SAFE WITH PROPER SOCIAL DISTANCING AS WELL
YOU0000005458_S0000586 THE BENEFITS FAR OUTWEIGH THE RISK
YOU0000005458_S0000592 WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING TEMPERATURES
YOU0000005458_S0000598 WHAT IS THE DISTRICT'S POLICY PLANS IF TEACHERS BECOME ILL

YOU0000005458_S0000610 THEY PROVIDE OUR CHILDREN WITH ADOLESCENTS WITH ACADEMIC INSTRUCTIONS SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS
YOU0000005458_S0000615 THESE CLOSURES ARE MUCH MORE SERIOUS AND DISRUPTIVE
YOU0000005458_S0000621 AS FOR TEACHERS WHO ARE CONCERNED
YOU0000005458_S0000627 THE KIDS NEED TO GET BACK TO IN PERSON LEARNING
YOU0000005458_S0000635 IN THE EVENT THE SCHOOLS ARE FORCED TO MOVE TO ONLINE CLASSES
YOU0000005458_S0000642 IT WOULD CREATE A TON OF SOCIAL DISTANCING FLEXIBILITY TO ALL BUT GUARANTEE SUCCESSFUL OPENING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR
YOU0000005458_S0000652 WE WANT OUR DAUGHTER IN SCHOOL HOWEVER WE ARE IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC
YOU0000005458_S0000657 IN THE LEVEL TWO PLAN THERE IS SIMPLY TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY FOR CHILDREN PUTTING THEM AT AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER
YOU0000005458_S0000663 THEN WILL WE BE EQUIPPED TO HAVE AN ENTIRE CLASS QUARANTINED AT HOME FOR TWO WEEKS WHEN THEIR TEACHER TESTS POSITIVE
YOU0000005458_S0000668 WILL WE SWIFTLY QUICKLY HAVE PROTOCOLS TO TEST TRACE ISOLATE

YOU0000005458_S0000708 COMMENT FROM MARC PERKINS
YOU0000005458_S0000714 THE RISKS TO OPENING OUR SCHOOLS OUTWEIGHS THE BENEFITS
YOU0000005458_S0000720 IF WE HAD ADEQUATE FUNDING EQUIPMENT AND TRAINED STAFF TO ENSURE SOCIAL DISTANCING AND OTHER GUIDELINES WERE MET TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF VIRAL TRANSFER THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONSIDER REOPENING OUR CAMPUSES FOR IN PERSON TEACHING

YOU0000005458_S0000738 COMMENT FROM ROBERT DICKINSON

YOU0000005458_S0000927 COMMENT FROM TRACIE CAGEN
YOU0000005458_S0000935 THIS IS NOT POLITICAL THIS IS A HEALTH CONCERN
YOU0000005458_S0000940 HOW CAN WE GUARANTEE ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE OR HIGH KIDS IN THE SAME FAMILY WILL HAVE THE SAME HALF SECTION MORNING OR AFTERNOON IN SCHOOL SO THAT WORKING FAMILIES CAN DO ONE TIME DROP OFF AND PICK UPS AT THE SAME TIME AND NOT DO IT ALL DAY
YOU0000005458_S0000945 IT IS ILL CONCEIVED TO APPROVE A MODEL FOR THE REOPENING OF SCHOOLS IN THE ABSENCE OF A PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES
YOU0000005458_S0000951 WHILE THE PROPOSED MODEL REFERENCES THE STAGES OF REOPENING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT DOES NOT INCLUDE AN OBJECTIVE STANDARD RELATED TO LOCAL HEALTH OR THE NEED FOR CORONAVIRUS INFECTION RATES TO BE STABLE OR DECLINING OVER A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME
YOU0000005458_S0000956 MAKE NO MISTAKE THAT THIS IS NOT A PLAN FOR INSTRUCTION
YOU0000005458_S0000962 WHAT ASSURANCES CAN THE BOARD GIVE TO STAKEHOLDERS THAT THIS PLAN CAN BE IMPLEMENTED SAFELY
YOU0000005458_S0000967 OPEN THE SCHOOLS
YOU0000005458_S0000972 WHY CAN'T WEDNESDAYS BE USED AS ANOTHER INSTRUCTION DAY FOR STUDENTS
YOU0000005458_S0000978 THAT WAY THE TEACHERS COULD STILL HAVE ONE A M OR P M SECTION A WEEK FOR DEVELOPMENT OR STUDENT ENRICHMENT
YOU0000005458_S0000983 COMMENT FROM SHANNON EKEDAL

YOU0000005458_S0000996 THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK FOR THE KIDS' SAKE PLEASE LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO HELP THESE KIDS GET BACK TO SCHOOL FULL TIME THANK YOU
YOU0000005458_S0001004 THE END OF THE LAST SCHOOL YEAR WAS VERY CHALLENGING AND WE FEEL WE HAD SOME OF THE BEST TEACHERS IN THE DISTRICT
YOU0000005458_S0001009 AS ELECTED OFFICIALS PLEASE PUT THE CHILDREN IN THE BEST POSITION TO LEARN
YOU0000005458_S0001017 I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE PLAN FOR HOW VIRTUAL LEARNING WOULD BE ROLLED OUT IN THE FALL SPECIFICALLY HOW THE KIDS WOULD BE GROUPED AND AT WHAT LEVEL
YOU0000005458_S0001023 OUT OF GREAT CHALLENGE COMES GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING AND EXPERIENCE
YOU0000005458_S0001030 THAT I MAY INSTEAD END UP ON A VENTILATOR
YOU0000005458_S0001038 I WOULD APPRECIATE THE BOARD CONSIDERING MY LIFE AND WELFARE AND THE WELFARE OF OTHERS AS HUMAN BEINGS AS WELL AS EMPLOYEES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
YOU0000005458_S0001044 THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM WAS A FAILURE THIS SPRING
YOU0000005458_S0001052 WILL ALL STUDENTS AND FACULTY GET TESTED FOR COVID NINETEEN BEFORE THEY ARE TO SET FOOT ON CAMPUS
YOU0000005458_S0001057 DO THESE STUDENTS EXPOSED TO A DIAGNOSED TEACHER GET TESTED FOR COVID NINETEEN
YOU0000005458_S0001062 WILL A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER BE WILLING TO WORK IN A CLASSROOM OF EXPOSED AND POSSIBLY INFECTED STUDENTS
YOU0000005458_S0001069 COMMENT FROM FANUA MATAGI
YOU0000005458_S0001077 THERE IS NO MENTION OF SAFETY IN THE LEVEL TWO MODEL PROPOSED IN THE PLAN BEFORE YOU TONIGHT
YOU0000005458_S0001082 WE NEED ASSURANCES THAT THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF HAND WASHING STATIONS
YOU0000005458_S0001092 AGAIN THESE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS COME AFTER WE KNOW WHAT OBJECTIVE HEALTH MEASURES WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE IF IT IS SAFE TO RETURN
YOU0000005458_S0001100 MY DREAM IS TO CONTINUE MY SERVICE FOR MANY YEARS IN THE VOCATION I WAS DESTINED TO PURSUE
YOU0000005458_S0001108 A DESCRIPTIVE LIST OF ALL CDC COMPLIANT DISTRICT PROVIDED PPE
YOU0000005458_S0001113 NUMBER FIVE

YOU0000005458_S0001124 CONTACT ALL TEACHERS AND STAFF UNDER FORTY FIVE WITH QUESTIONS
YOU0000005458_S0001129 IN OTHER WORDS THE STRUCTURE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED
YOU0000005458_S0001134 BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THEIR ADVERSE MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS ON SMALL CHILDREN
YOU0000005458_S0001139 AFTER THE SURVEY TENTATIVELY ASSIGN TEACHERS AND STAFF
YOU0000005458_S0001145 COMMENT FROM KIMBERLY LEE
YOU0000005458_S0001150 THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS WHAT DOES THE SCHOOL DISTRICT DO WHEN A STUDENT IS EXPOSED AND GOES TO SCHOOL OR IS POSITIVE AND GOES TO SCHOOL
YOU0000005458_S0001156 THAT WOULD JUST EXPOSE OUR CHILDREN TO MORE POTENTIAL TO GET THE VIRUS LASTLY
YOU0000005458_S0001161 WHAT ARE THE DISTRICT'S PLANS BACK TO SAFETY MY CONCERN IS THAT PARENTS WILL MAKE FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT THEIR KIDS ABOUT WHY THEIR KIDS DON'T HAVE TO WEAR MASKS AND THAT SCHOOL PERSONNEL WILL NOT POLICE THIS ISSUE
YOU0000005458_S0001167 DISTANCE LEARNING IS THE ONLY OPTION WE HAVE
YOU0000005458_S0001172 TWO AND THREE WHO WILL BE TEACHING THE ONLINE PLEASE PICK A PATH AND PUT ALL YOUR EFFORT INTO IT
YOU0000005458_S0001181 THE MENTAL EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF THESE CHILDREN IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS RECEIVING EDUCATION
YOU0000005458_S0001187 THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF OUR FAMILY WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER WITH OUR CHILDREN NOT BEING ALLOWED TO PHYSICALLY ATTEND SCHOOL
YOU0000005458_S0001192 WITH THE NEW ORDERS IT IS PRUDENT TO NOW THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX

YOU0000005458_S0001203 COMMENT SARAH BABOVIC
YOU0000005458_S0001209 IF ONLINE LEARNING CAN BE STREAMED OUT OF EACH CLASSROOM OR AT LEAST ONE CLASSROOM TEACHER PER GRADE
YOU0000005458_S0001214 THEN SUDDENLY SWITCH THEM TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT DISTANCE LEARNING FOR ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THEIR STUDENTS
YOU0000005458_S0001221 WILL MASKS BE REQUIRED ON CAMPUS WILL THE STUDENTS BE SAFELY DISTANCED
YOU0000005458_S0001227 FOR OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WE BELIEVE THAT LOCAL CONDITIONS SUPPORT THIS APPROACH
YOU0000005458_S0001232 DISTANCE LEARNING DOES NOT WORK PLEASE CONSIDER THE IDEA OF OUTDOOR CLASSROOMS OR OTHER SOCIAL DISTANCE OPTIONS TO OUR KIDS IN SCHOOL FACE TO FACE WITH THEIR TEACHER
YOU0000005458_S0001237 YOUR HYBRID OPTION IS A JOKE
YOU0000005458_S0001244 WITH THAT SAID KIDS ARE NOT GOING BACK TO SCHOOL WITH CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES
YOU0000005458_S0001251 THANK YOU WE MUST GET OUR YOUNG CHILDREN WHO ARE AT NO RISK BACK TO SCHOOL

YOU0000005458_S0002420 JUNE TWENTY THIRD

YOU0000005458_S0002519 AND SO THEY AREN'T IN THEIR QUOTE UNQUOTE HOME SCHOOL BUT THEY'RE IN A DIFFERENT SCHOOL THROUGH THE PROCESS
YOU0000005458_S0002530 ARE WE APPLYING FOR A SEPARATE SCHOOL ID OR WILL THE STUDENTS BE CONSIDERED A STUDENT
YOU0000005458_S0002542 YOU KNOW STUDENTS CHANGE THEIR MIND AFTER THE TRIMESTER OR THE SEMESTER OR AFTER THE SCHOOL YEAR
YOU0000005458_S0002551 IF A STUDENT WANTS TO COME INTO THE VIRTUAL ACADEMY SECOND SEMESTER CAN THEY DO THAT
YOU0000005458_S0002566 YEAH SO WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER AS MANY COURSES AS WE CAN
YOU0000005458_S0002589 AND THEN FINALLY
YOU0000005458_S0002606 WHICH MAY MEAN IF WE HAVE A LARGE GROUP OF STUDENTS THAT LEAVES ONE PARTICULAR SCHOOL
YOU0000005458_S0002615 WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL
YOU0000005458_S0002626 THEN THEY'RE IN THE THREE LEVEL ADAPTABLE PLAN
YOU0000005458_S0002633 COMBINATION CLASSES OF TWO GRADES IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW MANY PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR THIS

YOU0000005458_S0002656 OKAY IF THEY CHOOSE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
YOU0000005458_S0002668 WHAT WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE OF CHOOSING VIRTUAL LEARNING IF WE ALL END UP DOING SOME KIND OF DISTANCE LEARNING BASED ON BASED ON WHAT'S OPEN
YOU0000005458_S0002689 WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN BEING PART OF THIS VIRTUAL SCHOOL
YOU0000005458_S0002701 YEAH WE'VE CERTAINLY TALKED TO

YOU0000005458_S0002791 ARE WE FOCUSING ON ALL OF THE OTHER TEACHERS THAT POSSIBLY COULD HAVE TO SHIFT TO DISTANCE LEARNING
YOU0000005458_S0002807 OKAY THANK YOU
YOU0000005458_S0002818 WHICH GENERATED A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF IF WE HAD TO CHOOSE SOMETHING OTHER THAN NUMBER ONE
YOU0000005458_S0002824 AND WE WERE FOCUSING MORE ON THE FORTY PERCENT MODEL FIFTY PERCENT MODEL
YOU0000005458_S0002831 AND THE HALF DAY MODEL DID EMERGE AS SOMETHING THAT HAS SOME BENEFITS AND SOME SOME
YOU0000005458_S0002841 AND SHE WILL ALSO DESCRIBE SOME DETAILS OF THIS ELEMENTARY MODEL THAT WE'RE PROPOSING SO MR DRAKE
YOU0000005458_S0002863 LOTS OF TIME SPENT ON TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL OF MAKING SURE STUDENTS ARE AT SCHOOL EVERY DAY PRESENT
YOU0000005458_S0002872 SO THAT WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CLASSROOM AT ANY GIVEN TIME WOULD HAVE SIXTEEN STUDENTS SO THAT WE COULD
YOU0000005458_S0002884 NOW WE ALSO HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUR FOCUS GROUPS AND FROM THE BOARD AS WELL THAT WE REALLY WANTED TO LOOK AT OUR STUDENTS THAT ARE IN SDC CLASSES
YOU0000005458_S0002894 LEARNING GAMES SIMILAR TO OUR MATH WORK PLACES
YOU0000005458_S0002903 BEFORE WE GO BACK I DO WANT TO GO BACK WITH THE BOARD AND GET INPUT AND HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WEDNESDAYS BECAUSE AS YOU SAW IN KATHLEEN'S SLIDE
YOU0000005458_S0002909 EVERY DAY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WEDNESDAY
YOU0000005458_S0002917 WE OF COURSE ARE GONNA UTILIZE OUR MPR AS MUCH AS WE CAN PHYSICALLY DISTANCE
YOU0000005458_S0002925 AND IN OUR DISTRICT
YOU0000005458_S0002934 AND WE'LL HAVE TO DETERMINE SOME KIND OF CRITERIA TO DETERMINE HOW MANY STUDENTS WE CAN ACTUALLY TRANSPORT
YOU0000005458_S0002940 KEEP IN MIND STUDENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ON CAMPUS FOR AWHILE
YOU0000005458_S0002946 SO WITH THOSE TRADE OFFS I NOW WANT TO GO BACK AND ALLOW KATHLEEN TO COVER THIS SLIDE ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK TO THE BOARD FOR DISCUSSION ON THIS
YOU0000005458_S0002953 AND THIS WILL PROVIDE THAT
YOU0000005458_S0002961 IT WOULD BE VERY CONDUCIVE TO THAT
YOU0000005458_S0002967 ALL RIGHT I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE SLIDE HERE THAT ACTUALLY SHOWS THE STRUCTURE
YOU0000005458_S0002988 WE HAVE NOT MADE THE FINAL DECISION IN TERMS OF EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS FOR OUR DISTRICT
YOU0000005458_S0003006 WE'RE GOING TO BE MUCH BETTER PREPARED
YOU0000005458_S0003031 MARTHA
YOU0000005458_S0003054 AND SO THAT'S THE WORK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
YOU0000005458_S0003059 WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO WORK THESE PROCESSES OUT
YOU0000005458_S0003065 ALL OF THESE DETAILS PLAY INTO THAT
YOU0000005458_S0003077 MY ZONE
YOU0000005458_S0003097 OKAY MY TURN
YOU0000005458_S0003103 IF WE'RE
YOU0000005458_S0003115 OKAY NUMBER TWO
YOU0000005458_S0003124 AND LO AND BEHOLD IT'S THE SAME CHALLENGES WE'RE FACING
YOU0000005458_S0003134 COULD WE GO INTO DISTANCE LEARNING AND THE ANSWER IS YES AND VICE VERSA WE NEED TO BE NIMBLE IN THAT SENSE THAT WE AS A DISTRICT MIGHT HAVE TO MOVE BETWEEN THESE VARIOUS MODELS BETWEEN LEVEL ONE TWO AND THREE
YOU0000005458_S0003140 EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE DOING AND I WANT TO MAKE THIS POINT
YOU0000005458_S0003146 EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE CREATES A SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR KIDS
YOU0000005458_S0003155 WHAT LEVEL WE'RE GOING TO BE IN FOR THE START OF THE SCHOOL YEAR
YOU0000005458_S0003163 BUT TEACHERS NEED TO PREPARE THEIR LESSONS
YOU0000005458_S0003175 RUSSELL A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
YOU0000005458_S0003182 THE SECOND ONE HAS TO DO WITH
YOU0000005458_S0003190 THAT'S ANOTHER LOGISTICAL QUESTION
YOU0000005458_S0003201 BUT WE ALWAYS KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME EXCEPTIONS
YOU0000005458_S0003215 AND HERE'S THE CHALLENGE THOUGH
YOU0000005458_S0003223 OKAY AND HERE'S WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE
YOU0000005458_S0003229 WELL AND I ALSO HOPE THAT WE CONSIDER DIFFERENT MODALITIES
YOU0000005458_S0003238 WE DO HAVE TO DO THIS TECHNOLOGY WISE CAUSE KEEP IN MIND WE HAVE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS
YOU0000005458_S0003252 THE STATE ORDER OR A COUNTY ORDER
YOU0000005458_S0003266 THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS CAN WE PROVIDE THAT STANDARD OF CARE FOR EVERYBODY TO KEEP THEM SAFE
YOU0000005458_S0003275 IF I CAN SAY SOMETHING TO EVERYBODY LISTENING THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE FOLLOW THE SAFETY GUIDELINES AND WE REALLY NEED TO SEE THOSE NUMBERS COMING DOWN BECAUSE THAT TRULY IS JEOPARDIZING OUR REOPENING
YOU0000005458_S0003283 MY TURN
YOU0000005458_S0003298 WHAT'S CONFUSING TO ME IS
YOU0000005458_S0003308 LOOKING TO THE MOST STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS FROM THE STATE FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY
YOU0000005458_S0003319 THAT WOULD BE EASY
YOU0000005458_S0003330 SO YOU KNOW
YOU0000005458_S0003345 AND THAT'S THE ONLY GOOD PART
YOU0000005458_S0003356 AND WOULD THEY GET NOW ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS WAS THAT SOME TEACHERS DIDN'T SPEND MORE THAN FIVE OR TEN MINUTES WITH THEIR STUDENTS WOULD THEY GET THE FULL YOU KNOW
YOU0000005458_S0003374 AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK PARENTS WANT TO KNOW AND PARENTS WILL BE MORE
YOU0000005458_S0003388 BUT THE LEARNING DOESN'T STOP THERE
YOU0000005458_S0003405 IN THIS MODEL
YOU0000005458_S0003414 IF WE HAD HALF THE KIDS INSIDE AND HALF THE KIDS OUTSIDE WE COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE THE STUDENTS OUTSIDE BECAUSE THERE'D BE TOO MANY
YOU0000005458_S0003424 WITHIN THE HOUR IT'S LIKE
YOU0000005458_S0003441 THE ONE COHORT
YOU0000005458_S0003453 SO IT'S NOT DIVIDED INTO TWO EQUAL COHORTS OH OKAY
YOU0000005458_S0003467 I WOULD LIKE US TO DO THAT A LITTLE BIT BETTER
YOU0000005458_S0003482 WE SAW THAT THEY WERE OVERWORKED THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON IN THE SPRING

YOU0000005466_S0000151 IS
YOU0000005466_S0000164 BUT IT CAN HAPPEN IT MIGHT BE CLUMSY IT MIGHT BE AWKWARD IT MIGHT BE EMBARRASSING IT MIGHT MAKE YOU ANGRY SOMETIMES
YOU0000005466_S0000170 WE BRISTLE A LITTLE BIT NO
YOU0000005466_S0000194 A KIND OF FASCINATION A LOVE AND A CURIOSITY
YOU0000005466_S0000204 YOU KNOW SITTING IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER AND I'M SURE THERE ARE MOMENTS OF THINKING LIKE IS THIS RELEVANT IS THIS YOU KNOW IN THESE FAST MOVING TIMES
YOU0000005466_S0000225 I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION
YOU0000005474_S0000023 THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION WAS NEVER DETERMINED BUT CASTRO PUBLICLY INSINUATED THAT THE US GOVERNMENT WERE GUILTY OF SABOTAGE
YOU0000005474_S0000032 IT MUST BE NOTED THAT ON THE SURFACE THE US WAS TRYING TO IMPROVE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH CUBA
YOU0000005474_S0000041 SOME METHODS THAT THE CIA UNDERTOOK TO MURDER CASTRO WERE CREATIVE FOR EXAMPLE POISON PILLS AN EXPLODING SEA SHELL AND A PLANNED GIFT OF A DIVING SUIT CONTAMINATED WITH TOXINS
YOU0000005474_S0000060 SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK RAISED SOME EYEBROWS BY CONTEMPLATING AIRDROPPING A BULLDOZER TO EXTEND THE AIRFIELD
YOU0000005474_S0000074 TO CREATE A NAVY THE CIA PURCHASED FIVE CARGO SHIPS FROM THE CUBAN-OWNED BUT MIAMI-BASED GARCIA LINE THEREBY GIVING PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY AS THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAD INSISTED NO US SHIPS COULD BE INVOLVED IN THE INVASION
YOU0000005474_S0000088 THE REBELS WERE TRAINED IN AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULT TACTICS GUERRILLA WARFARE INFANTRY AND WEAPONS TRAINING UNIT TACTICS AND LAND NAVIGATION
YOU0000005474_S0000095 MAJOR JUAN ALMEIDA BOSQUE COMMANDED FORCES IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES BASED IN SANTA CLARA
YOU0000005474_S0000115 AFTER ON-LOADING THE ATTACK PLANES IN NORFOLK NAVAL BASE AND TAKING ON UNUSUAL QUANTITIES OF FOOD AND SUPPLIES SUFFICIENT FOR THE SEVEN WEEKS AT-SEA TO COME THE CREW KNEW FROM THE HASTY CAMOUFLAGE OF THE SHIP'S AND AIRCRAFT IDENTIFYING NUMBERS THAT A SECRET MISSION WAS ON HAND
YOU0000005474_S0000124 THE RECONNAISSANCE BOATS TURNED BACK TO THE SHIP AFTER THEIR CREWS DETECTED ACTIVITIES BY CUBAN MILITIA FORCES ALONG THE COASTLINE AS A RESULT OF THOSE ACTIVITIES AT DAYBREAK A RECONNAISSANCE SORTIE OVER THE BARACOA AREA WAS LAUNCHED FROM SANTIAGO DE CUBA
YOU0000005474_S0000137 ABOUT NINETY MINUTES AFTER THE EIGHT B TWENTY SIX S HAD TAKEN OFF FROM PUERTO CABEZAS TO ATTACK CUBAN AIRFIELDS ANOTHER B TWENTY SIX DEPARTED ON A DECEPTION FLIGHT THAT TOOK IT CLOSE TO CUBA BUT HEADED NORTH TOWARDS FLORIDA
YOU0000005474_S0000146 IN RESPONSE TO ROA'S ACCUSATIONS BEFORE THE UN US AMBASSADOR TO THE UN ADLAI STEVENSON STATED THAT US ARMED FORCES WOULD NOT UNDER ANY CONDITIONS INTERVENE IN CUBA AND THAT THE US WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO ENSURE THAT NO US CITIZENS WOULD PARTICIPATE IN ACTIONS AGAINST CUBA
YOU0000005474_S0000179 OTHER TROOPS WERE DROPPED AT SAN BLAS AT JOCUMA BETWEEN COVADONGA AND SAN BLAS AND AT HORQUITAS BETWEEN YAGUARAMAS AND SAN BLAS
YOU0000005474_S0000188 THE LOSS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SHIP RIO ESCONDIDO MEANT THAT SAN ROMAN WAS ONLY ABLE TO ISSUE ORDERS TO THE FORCES AT BLUE BEACH AND HE HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT RED BEACH OR WITH THE PARATROOPERS
YOU0000005474_S0000209 BOTH THE BLAGAR AND BARBARA J RETURNED AT MIDNIGHT TO LAND MORE AMMUNITION WHICH PROVED INSUFFICIENT FOR THE BRIGADISTAS
YOU0000005474_S0000234 SORTIES WERE FLOWN TO REASSURE BRIGADE SOLDIERS AND PILOTS AND TO INTIMIDATE CUBAN GOVERNMENT FORCES WITHOUT DIRECTLY ENGAGING IN ACTS OF WAR
YOU0000005474_S0000248 PARATROOPER EUGENE HERMAN KOCH WAS KILLED IN ACTION AND THE AMERICAN AIRMEN SHOT DOWN WERE THOMAS W RAY LEO F BAKER RILEY W SHAMBURGER AND WADE C GRAY
YOU0000005482_S0000011 WHAT ABOUT THE BEYOND MEAT AND THE IMPOSSIBLE BURGER AND ALL THAT I'M ACTUALLY MAKING A WHOLE VIDEO ON THOSE COMING OUT VERY SOON FOR NOW LET'S JUST SAY IF YOU'RE EATING THOSE ONCE IN A WHILE TO SCRATCH THAT ITCH PROBABLY NOT A HUGE DEAL BUT THEY'RE NOT THE FOUNDATION OF A HEALTHY DIET
YOU0000005482_S0000021 ARE YOU THE SAME WAY IF SO I GET IT BUT THE TRUTH IS IT'S NOT IN THE DETAILS THE KEY HERE IS THE OVERALL PATTERN SO IF YOU'RE EATING A LOT OF PLANTS MOSTLY UNPROCESSED AND A VARIETY OF THEM YOU'RE CRUSHING IT STEP FORWARD ONE STEP AT A TIME
YOU0000005482_S0000038 LET GO OF THAT PRESSURE I LEARNED THIS ONE THE HARD WAY
YOU0000005490_S0000024 MY OLD BOSS HE WAS A PROFESSOR OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
YOU0000005490_S0000052 YOU KNOW MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN CHARGE OF FOOD SAFETY INSTEAD OF AGRICULTURAL PROFESSIONALS
YOU0000005490_S0000068 AND SO THAT'S A BOON NOT ONLY TO BIG PHARMA WHICH SELLS THESE CHRONIC DISEASE DRUGS THAT PEOPLE TAKE EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY TREATING THE CAUSE OF THEIR DISEASE
YOU0000005490_S0000080 WE REGULATE TOBACCO THERE ARE WARNING LABELS ON TOBACCO THERE SHOULD BE SIMILAR REGULATIONS TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM PROCESSED MEAT
YOU0000005490_S0000090 LET'S GET THAT OUT OF OUR DIET
YOU0000005490_S0000100 LOW CARB DIETS DO YOU THINK THEY'RE ACTIVELY PUTTING THIS MISINFORMATION OUT OR THEY JUST MISINFORMED THEMSELVES
YOU0000005490_S0000117 THERE'S BEEN WARS OVER OIL
YOU0000005490_S0000128 RIGHT FROM A PURELY CAPITALIST STANDPOINT
YOU0000005490_S0000170 YOU'LL NEVER HEAR ABOUT IT IT GETS BURIED
YOU0000005490_S0000186 CAME FROM YOU KNOW DENIS BURKITT WHO WAS AN IRISH SURGEON
YOU0000005490_S0000195 ORNISH
YOU0000005490_S0000220 KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK YOURSELF
YOU0000005498_S0000010 TIMING IT PERFECTLY IN THE VIDEO RIGHT AFTER THE CONTENT IS OVER OR EVEN JUST AS A GENTLE REMINDER BEFORE THE VIDEO BEGINS CAN PROVE TO BE IMPACTFUL
YOU0000005498_S0000016 ONE IMPORTANT TIP IS SOMETIMES WHEN YOU SHARE YOUR ENTIRE VIDEO ON FACEBOOK OR OTHER PLATFORMS
YOU0000005498_S0000022 NUMBER FOUR STRATEGY IS CHOOSE APPROPRIATE KEYWORDS FOR YOUR VIDEO TITLE CONTENT AND TAGS
YOU0000005498_S0000029 SO FIND OUT THESE LONG TAIL KEYWORDS THAT SUIT YOUR VIDEO
YOU0000005506_S0000004 FOR EXAMPLE I'VE TALKED ABOUT MY SOKANI LIGHTS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF VIDEOS BUT WHAT I WAS ORIGINALLY GOING TO BUY WERE THE APUTURE MC LIGHTS THAT I'D READ ABOUT
YOU0000005506_S0000009 THE THINGS I DO USE ARE RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE BUT EVEN SO EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT BUDGET SO I'LL DO MY BEST TO MENTION OPTIONS THAT ARE EVEN CHEAPER THAN WHAT I HAVE
YOU0000005506_S0000016 ALRIGHT LET'S GET STARTED
YOU0000005506_S0000021 NOBODY HAS TO SEE YOUR SCRIPT IF IT'S JUST A ROADMAP FOR YOU
YOU0000005506_S0000028 I'VE WRITTEN A BATCH FILE THAT TAKES ALL THE IMAGES IN A FOLDER AND MAKES A PDF THE WAY I WANT IT
YOU0000005506_S0000033 YOU GET SO MUCH QUALITY FOR THE MONEY WITH ALL THEIR GEAR AND SOFTWARE
YOU0000005506_S0000039 I MENTION THIS MOSTLY SO I HAVE SOMETHING NEGATIVE TO SAY ABOUT THEM AND NOT SEEM LIKE A TOTAL SHILL
YOU0000005506_S0000045 THERE'S AN APP CALLED FILMIC PRO THAT ENABLES YOU TO MANUALLY CHANGE SETTINGS LIKE EXPOSURE WHITE BALANCE FOCUS FRAME RATE AND SO ON
YOU0000005506_S0000054 WHEN YOU'RE ZOOMED OUT ALL THE WAY YOU DO GET SOME VIGNETTING WHICH YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH
YOU0000005506_S0000062 DO YOU NEED A MATTE BOX
YOU0000005506_S0000067 I HAPPENED TO FIND A THREE D MODEL ONLINE THAT WAS CUSTOM MADE FOR THIS LENS
YOU0000005506_S0000077 IT'S ALRIGHT IT HAS FOUR CHANNELS IT HAS FEATURES LIKE RECORDING A SEPARATE TRACK WITH A LOWER VOLUME SO YOU'RE NOT SCREWED IF SOMETHING WAS TOO LOUD AND CLIPPED YOU HAVE A BACKUP
YOU0000005506_S0000087 I HAVE A VIDEO ON MAKING ONE OF THOSE TOO
YOU0000005506_S0000093 WITH BATTERIES YOU PUT THE LIGHT WHERE YOU WANT IT

YOU0000005514_S0000342 AS A STAT
YOU0000005514_S0000352 I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT VIDEO CONTENT IS NATIVELY INTEGRATED INTO STEAM
YOU0000005514_S0000357 NOW I'VE GOT A FEW IMAGES HERE THIS FIRST TOP LEFT IMAGE REPRESENTS SOME OF MY PROFILE

YOU0000005514_S0000407 STARTING IN SORT OF MARCH THIS YEAR YOU CAN SEE THAT NEXT SORT OF BUMP IN THE AMOUNT OF CONTENT THAT WAS COMING ON
YOU0000005514_S0000412 AND THE CONVERSATIONS WE'RE HAVING THAT LINE IS GONNA CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH THE ROOF
YOU0000005514_S0000421 THIS IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE SINCE WATCHED A STREAMING VIDEO
YOU0000005514_S0000426 NOW THAT GROWTH HAS COME THROUGH A NUMBER OF WAYS BUT I WANT TO PICK ON TWO
YOU0000005514_S0000433 AND THEN THEY RELEASED A SERIES OF EPISODES FOUR EPISODES CALLED AGENT ORIGINS AND IT TELLS THE BACKSTORY OF EACH OF THE CHARACTERS
YOU0000005514_S0000438 WAS AGENT ORIGINS

YOU0000005514_S0000455 THE ENTIRE THING NOW THERE'S ENGLISH SUBTITLES

YOU0000005514_S0000468 OK REVENUE
YOU0000005514_S0000475 NINE PERCENT OF ALL THE REVENUE IS TUTORIALS
YOU0000005514_S0000481 THE OTHER PART ABOUT IT IS
YOU0000005514_S0000487 MAYBE ITS AVAILABILITY BUT ANIME CONTENT IS DOING WELL
YOU0000005514_S0000494 AND IT IS SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF
YOU0000005514_S0000505 AFTER THAT IT JUST LOOKS LIKE PUTTING A GAME ON STEAM YOU'LL CREATE THE STORE PAGE ALL THE ASSETS ALL THE CAPSULE ART DESCRIPTIONS
YOU0000005514_S0000514 SO

YOU0000005514_S0000763 CERTAINLY THINGS TO DO WITH MODELING
YOU0000005514_S0000772 THE VIDEO PLATFORM SOUNDS REALLY EXCITING
YOU0000005514_S0000781 AND IT CAN HAVE
YOU0000005514_S0000792 AWESOME WELL THANKS FOR BEING HERE
YOU0000005522_S0000007 AND CONSULT WITH LAWYERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT OUR THOUGHTS ON THE LEGAL MATTERS REGARDING THESE ISSUES ARE CORRECT
YOU0000005522_S0000073 BUT THERE'S SOME PRETTY BAD MOJO IN VARIOUS PLURAL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE COMMUNITY
YOU0000005522_S0000078 WHERE CONTROLLING FRONT IS A WAY OF STRIPPING THE OTHERS OF POWER AND CONTROL RATHER THAN APPROACHING THE FOLK ON THE INSIDE
YOU0000005522_S0000083 IN THE FILM WHAT DREAMS MAY COME
YOU0000005522_S0000088 CHRIS MY BRAIN I SUPPOSE
YOU0000005522_S0000093 THE PART OF ME THAT THINKS THAT FEELS
YOU0000005522_S0000100 ONE I AM
YOU0000005522_S0000107 AND BEING A PART OF A CULTURALLY ESTABLISHED FORM OF SOCIAL RELATIONS
YOU0000005522_S0000112 IN ADDITION TO THE QUESTION OF PERSONHOOD
YOU0000005522_S0000117 DESPITE ANY INTERVENING CHANGES
YOU0000005522_S0000122 BUT THERE WAS ONE LINK ON THE PAGE THAT LOOKED INTERESTING
YOU0000005522_S0000129 WHICH THERE'S A LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW
YOU0000005522_S0000134 SUCH AS DOLPHINS AND WHALES
YOU0000005522_S0000139 AND MANY OTHERS
YOU0000005522_S0000147 TO BE GIVEN THE BEST QUALITY OF LIFE AND WELFARE POSSIBLE IN CAPTIVITY
YOU0000005522_S0000152 FUNCTIONS AND BEHAVIORS THAT GIVE RISE TO PERSONHOOD
YOU0000005522_S0000158 SOMEONE IS SAYING SOME ANIMALS DESERVE MORE BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS THAN OUR HEAD MATES ARE AFFORDED
YOU0000005522_S0000163 AND THAT'S WHERE THERE LIES A BIG ISSUE
YOU0000005522_S0000169 NOR EVEN A MIND
YOU0000005522_S0000175 IS SIMPLY A HOT MESS
YOU0000005522_S0000181 WOMEN COULDN'T VOTE DIDN'T HAVE RIGHTS REGARDLESS OF RACE
YOU0000005522_S0000186 INCOME OR CLASS
YOU0000005522_S0000191 ACCORDING TO OTHER PARTS OF THEIR WEBSITE INCLUDE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCES
YOU0000005522_S0000198 CAPACITIES OR ATTRIBUTES COMMON TO DEFINITIONS OF PERSONHOOD CAN INCLUDE HUMAN NATURE AGENCY SELF-AWARENESS A NOTION OF THE PAST AND FUTURE
YOU0000005522_S0000203 WE SHOULD HAVE BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ABILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS IN OUR SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO TESTIFY IN COURT
YOU0000005522_S0000208 AND UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE BASICALLY POWERLESS TO CHANGE THOSE STANDARDS UNLESS WE BAND TOGETHER
YOU0000005522_S0000214 DISRUPTION OF IDENTITY CHARACTERIZED BY TWO OR MORE DISTINCT PERSONALITY STATES
YOU0000005522_S0000220 THESE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS MAY BE OBSERVED BY OTHERS OR REPORTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL
YOU0000005522_S0000225 I WOULD SUPPOSE THEN THAT ALTER IS SHORT SHORT FOR ALTERATIONS
YOU0000005522_S0000230 WHERE THESE TWO IDENTITIES ARE DEFINED AS HAVING A DISTINCT SENSE OF SELF AND SELF-CONTROL
YOU0000005522_S0000235 OR SYSTEM MEMBERS AS PLURALS MIGHT PREFER TO CALL THEM
YOU0000005522_S0000240 NOT EVERY SINGULAR PERSON IS ALWAYS IN POSSESSION OF ALL OF THESE CRITERIA AT ONCE EITHER
YOU0000005522_S0000245 AND THE RELUCTANCE OF PSYCHOLOGY TO GRANT ANY MORE THAN ONE OF THESE RIGHTS TO ONE BODY
YOU0000005522_S0000250 AND THUS TRUST TO RELIABLY REMEMBER AND REPORT THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES
YOU0000005522_S0000255 A HOST IS ALSO AN ALTER
YOU0000005522_S0000263 AND THIS LEADS TO THE ISSUE OF PROPER MEDICAL CARE FOR TRANS PLURALS AS WELL
YOU0000005522_S0000268 THERE IS NO WAY AS A LEGAL GROUP ENTITY WE CAN PROVE TO THEM WHAT PORTION OR PERCENT OF OUR HEAD MATES HAVE AGREED TO A MEDICAL PROCEDURE
YOU0000005522_S0000273 WE FEEL THAT WE DEVELOPED MANY IDENTITIES IN PARALLEL AS A CHILD
YOU0000005522_S0000280 ALLERGIES PLASMA GLUCOSE LEVELS IN DIABETIC PATIENTS
YOU0000005522_S0000287 OUR BODY COULD PROBABLY TEACH SCIENCE AND MEDICINE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT GENETIC EXPRESSION AND SO ON
YOU0000005522_S0000292 THAT PSYCHOLOGY ARE THE KEEPERS
YOU0000005522_S0000299 THIS IS HOW HOMOSEXUALITY WAS ONCE ABERRANT BEHAVIOR AND CONSIDERED A MENTAL ILLNESS BUT NO LONGER IS
YOU0000005522_S0000304 SO PRESSURE WAS PUT ON THE INDUSTRY OF PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY TO CHANGE THEIR DIAGNOSTIC BOOK TO ACCEPT HOMOSEXUALITY AS BEING OKAY
YOU0000005522_S0000311 THERE'S GOOD AND BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS
YOU0000005522_S0000317 PERSON IS A QUASI LEGAL CONCEPT OR HAS LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS
YOU0000005522_S0000322 THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS NOT ALWAYS GRANTED TO EVERY HUMAN
YOU0000005522_S0000328 FOR PLURALS HOWEVER AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW WHOMEVER IS FRONTING AS LONG AS THEIR BODY IS A VOTING AGE MAY VOTE IN AN ELECTION
YOU0000005522_S0000333 BUT THE SAME PERSON EXERTING THOSE RIGHTS AT THE MOMENT
YOU0000005522_S0000340 IT COMES FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY SOCIAL RIGHTS AND ACCOMMODATIONS
YOU0000005522_S0000347 THE PLURAL COMMUNITY BELIEVES IN SHARED RESPONSIBILITY ON A BODY-WIDE LEVEL
YOU0000005522_S0000352 AND NOW WOULD EXCLUDE ANYONE EVEN IN THE SAME BODY
YOU0000005522_S0000358 AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A MORE HUMANE WAY TO HANDLE MEDICAL DECISIONS REGARDING OUR SHARED BODY
YOU0000005522_S0000364 EVERY PERSONALITY WAS CREATED FOR A REASON AND WITH A PURPOSE TO SELECTIVELY ENCOURAGE SOME AND IGNORE OR SUPPRESS OTHERS IS TO ASK FOR TROUBLE
YOU0000005522_S0000370 CERTAIN TERMS WOULD REINFORCE A BELIEF THAT THE ALTERNATE IDENTITIES ARE SEPARATE PEOPLE OR PERSONS RATHER THAN A SINGLE HUMAN BEING WITH SUBJECTIVELY DIVIDED SELF ASPECTS
YOU0000005522_S0000375 WE AREN'T ASKING FOR CONTRACTUAL PERSONHOOD OR ADDITIONAL FOOD STAMPS
YOU0000005522_S0000380 RECOGNITION AS VALUED CHERISHED CONSTANT CONSCIOUS ENTITIES WITH OUR OWN NEEDS AND DESIRES
YOU0000005522_S0000386 AND THEY MAY BE TRYING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM PLURALS IN COURT
YOU0000005522_S0000391 IS THE ONE THAT DECIDES WHETHER WE'RE FIT TO FIGHT
YOU0000005522_S0000401 THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE NOT A COL
YOU0000005522_S0000407 I'M NOT KNOCKING THIS IDEA AS INSPIRATION FOR HOW SYSTEM MEMBERS CAME INTO EXISTENCE
YOU0000005522_S0000413 TO NOT RECOGNIZE US AS SEPARATE TO SOME DEGREE IS EVEN GOING AGAINST WHAT THEY THEMSELVES HAVE SAID
YOU0000005522_S0000419 OR TRYING TO MAKE US GO AWAY
YOU0000005522_S0000424 AND
YOU0000005522_S0000429 WOULD THAT BE A BREACH OF HIPAA LAW IN THE UNITED STATES
YOU0000005522_S0000435 BETWEEN HEADMATES AND THE PLURAL COMMUNITY WOULD SAY BUT YOU CAN BREACH TRUST BETWEEN HEADMATES AND WE DESERVE THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY EVEN FROM EACH OTHER
YOU0000005522_S0000440 WE AS A COMMUNITY CAN EASILY SEE THAT THIS SHOULDN'T BE THE WAY THAT A THERAPIST OPERATES
YOU0000005522_S0000445 AND A HINT OF IT IN THE ISSTD GUIDELINES
YOU0000005522_S0000450 AND AS MENTIONED IN THE STRUCTURAL DISSOCIATION THEORY'S ABLEIST ARTICLE ON THE POWER TO THE PLURALS WEBSITE
YOU0000005522_S0000455 WORST CASE SCENARIO
YOU0000005522_S0000460 THINK BACK TO CHILDHOOD AND PARENTS PLAYING FAVORITES
YOU0000005522_S0000465 AND BECAUSE IT IS LATER ON USED TO REINFORCE THE SINGULAR AGENDA OF SUPPRESSING ALL BUT ONE HEADMATE
YOU0000005522_S0000470 SUPER-EGO IN FREUDIAN THERAPY JUNGIAN THEORIES OF ANIMA ANIMUS
YOU0000005522_S0000477 THE ASSUMPTION THAT ANY HUMAN BEING IS ACTING IN THEIR ENTIRE AND WHOLE CAPACITY AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT
YOU0000005522_S0000483 THEY MAY HAVE MORE AGENCY AND SELF AWARENESS AS INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR OWN
YOU0000005522_S0000488 BUT IS NOT DENIED AUTONOMY PERSONHOOD OR CULTURAL RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSION BASED ON THEIR FAILURE TO BE ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT
YOU0000005522_S0000494 THAT OUR COMMUNITY COMMUNICATES TO NEW NEWLY AWAKENED PLURALS
YOU0000005522_S0000501 THE DSM RECOGNIZES AND MUST RECOGNIZE CULTURAL AND NON-DISORDERED PLURALITY
YOU0000005522_S0000506 SWITCH ROLES CODE SWITCH
YOU0000005522_S0000511 AND SO ON COULD BE MORE INHERENTLY DYSFUNCTIONAL IN SOCIETY
YOU0000005522_S0000519 INCLUDING FRANK PUTNAM'S BOOK
YOU0000005522_S0000525 WHENEVER HE'S TALKING ABOUT NARCISSISTIC INVESTMENT
YOU0000005522_S0000531 ENDS UP BEING COINED AS A NARCISSISTIC INVESTMENT
YOU0000005522_S0000537 SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PSYCHOLOGY RESISTANCE TO THE IDEA OF US ALL ACTUALLY LIKING EACH OTHER AND WANTING TO LIVE TOGETHER FOR THE REST OF OUR LIFE IS
YOU0000005522_S0000542 THIS WHOLE IDEA
YOU0000005522_S0000549 IT'S NOT A NARCISSISTIC INVESTMENT IN YOURSELF
YOU0000005522_S0000555 WHAT STUDIES EXPERIMENTS AND SO ON HAVE BEEN DONE ON THIS
YOU0000005522_S0000562 I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE NOT CARING ABOUT OR LOOKING OUT FOR THOSE I SHARE A BODY WITH THAT'S DISGUSTING IT'S IMMORAL AND UNTHINKABLE TO US
YOU0000005522_S0000567 THAT THOSE PLURAL SYSTEMS ARE MAKING NO HEADWAY TOWARDS LIVING A MORE FUNCTIONAL LIFE WITH THAT TYPE OF AN ATTITUDE TOWARDS EACH OTHER
YOU0000005522_S0000574 REGARD
YOU0000005522_S0000579 WE'RE GONNA SAY IT AGAIN
YOU0000005522_S0000587 IT'S A PART OF THE HUMAN CONDITION IN THE PAST THERE'S NO SIGN OF IT EVER GOING AWAY
YOU0000005522_S0000592 WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXIST WITHOUT BEING OPPRESSED
YOU0000005522_S0000599 THE MAJORITY
YOU0000005522_S0000605 OR TRAUMATIZED THE WAY THAT MANY PLURALS HAVE BEEN
YOU0000005522_S0000610 SOME OF US GO TO A THERAPIST AND LEAVE BEFORE EVER GETTING DIAGNOSED WITH ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT
YOU0000005522_S0000616 THE MISTREATMENT AND MISHANDLING OF OUR ISSUES LEAVES US WITH TRAUMA THERAPY
YOU0000005522_S0000622 SOME QUIT ALONG THE WAY NEVER TO RETURN AND UNLIKELY TO MAKE IT TO THE THERAPIST'S LISTS OF STATISTICS
YOU0000005522_S0000627 THEN THERE ARE THOSE WHO MAKE IT THROUGH THE MANY YEARS OF THERAPY TO GET TO THE POINT OF ATTEMPTING UNIFICATION
YOU0000005522_S0000634 AND THEN SOME WILL APPARENTLY UNIFY GETTING DOWN TO ONE
YOU0000005522_S0000641 YOU HAVEN'T BEEN SINGULAR FOR DECADES IF EVER BY THIS POINT
YOU0000005522_S0000648 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER A PLURAL JUST FORCES THEMSELVES INTO THIS
YOU0000005522_S0000653 THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOSE ANYTHING GOOD TO BE ONE PERSON
YOU0000005522_S0000660 I THINK PUTNAM SAYS ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT REMAIN ONE
YOU0000005522_S0000667 NOT COUNTING ALL THE TIME IT TAKES TO GET THERE
YOU0000005522_S0000672 WHY DON'T JUST HEAD TOWARDS FULL FUNCTIONAL MULTIPLICITY AND MAKE THAT THE GOAL OF TREATMENT
YOU0000005522_S0000677 IT'S OUR JOB TO TELL YOU WHAT WE WANT
YOU0000005522_S0000683 WE HAVE ONE BODY
YOU0000005522_S0000688 WE CAN TALK UNTIL WE'RE BLUE IN THE FACE ABOUT MEDIA STEREOTYPES
YOU0000005522_S0000693 FROM THOSE MEDIA STEREOTYPES
YOU0000005522_S0000700 THEN THERE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE GOOD STUFF WE'RE DOING IN THE WORLD
YOU0000005522_S0000705 THERE'S BEEN SOME CHANGES IN THAT A LITTLE
YOU0000005522_S0000711 WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR VISIBILITY IN ORDER TO START CRUSHING STEREOTYPES AND BIAS IN THE COMMUNITY
YOU0000005522_S0000716 IF SOMEONE'S LIKE WOW DID YOU HEAR SO AND SO IS PLURAL
YOU0000005522_S0000722 YOU CAN FOLLOW THE MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC MODELS ALL THE WAY TO UNIFICATION
YOU0000005522_S0000727 AND YOU NEED TO GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO EACH OTHER UNTIL YOU BECOME ONE
YOU0000005522_S0000733 BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO LIVE TOGETHER FOR LIFE WE NEED TO GET ALONG
YOU0000005522_S0000738 PLURALITY IS A TOTALLY VALID HUMAN EXPERIENCE
YOU0000005522_S0000744 IT'S OKAY TO LIKE BEING PLURAL
YOU0000005522_S0000749 A GOOD THERAPIST WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN
YOU0000005522_S0000755 NO ONE IS COMFORTED BY FEELING OUT OF CONTROL OF THEIR LIVES
YOU0000005522_S0000761 BUT NOW YOU'VE CREATED ANOTHER PROBLEM
YOU0000005522_S0000766 IN PURSUIT OF WHAT THEY THINK IS OKAY
YOU0000005522_S0000771 WHILE IT ALSO IMPLIES LARGER LEGAL STATUS AND PERSONHOOD
YOU0000005522_S0000776 WE ARE NOT SEEKING ADDITIONAL RIGHTS NOR DO WE THINK THAT'S FAIR
YOU0000005522_S0000782 EXTRA PUBLIC ASSISTANCE OR FINANCIAL BENEFITS BEYOND THOSE GIVEN ANYONE ELSE WITH A SINGLE BODY
YOU0000005522_S0000787 SO THINGS LIKE WE'RE NOT A JOKE
YOU0000005522_S0000795 BUT THE REST OF US DON'T WE WANT SOMEBODY THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT
YOU0000005522_S0000801 FOR MANY VARIOUS GOOD REASONS HAVING TO DO WITH ABUSE AND TRAUMA
YOU0000005522_S0000811 AND PLURAL REPRESENTATION ACROSS THE BOARD
YOU0000005522_S0000818 THEY'RE JUST MORE SPECIFIC
YOU0000005522_S0000824 ALL THESE LINKS ARE IN THE SHOW NOTES BELOW
YOU0000005522_S0000830 HOPEFULLY YOU WON'T EITHER IT'S A VERY ODD PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATE AND WE'RE STILL NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IT'S GOING TO MEAN SO HOPEFULLY YOU'LL JOIN US IN A CONVERSATION
YOU0000005530_S0000004 TO TRAVERSE THAT SPACE AGAIN WOULD REQUIRE HIS UTMOST FORTITUDE BUT HE KNEW IT MUST BE DONE
YOU0000005530_S0000010 SOME VACANT AND SOME EVIDENTLY USED AS STOREROOMS AND IN SEVERAL OF THE LATTER HE SAW SOME VERY CURIOUS ACCUMULATIONS OF VARIOUS OBJECTS
YOU0000005530_S0000015 BUT WHAT HE DISLIKED MOST OF ALL WERE THE HUGE COPPER VATS WHICH OCCASIONALLY APPEARED THESE
YOU0000005530_S0000020 THIS HE PROCEEDED TO INVESTIGATE AND AFTER ENTERING THREE ROOMS OF MEDIUM SIZE AND OF NO SIGNIFICANT CONTENTS
YOU0000005530_S0000025 AMONG THE BOOKS WAS A TATTERED OLD COPY OF BORELLUS IN BLACK-LETTER
YOU0000005530_S0000030 FROM HIS CURSORY SURVEY HE SAW THAT TWO LED MERELY TO SMALL STOREROOMS BUT THESE HE CANVASSED WITH CARE
YOU0000005530_S0000035 THESE HAD SUFFERED DAMAGE AT THE HANDS OF THE RAIDERS
YOU0000005530_S0000040 SOME OF THE UPPER LEVELS WERE WHOLLY VACANT BUT MOST OF THE SPACE WAS FILLED WITH SMALL ODD-LOOKING LEADEN JARS OF TWO GENERAL TYPES ONE TALL AND WITHOUT HANDLES LIKE A GRECIAN LEKYTHOS OR OIL-JUG
YOU0000005530_S0000046 FOR THE MOMENT HOWEVER HE WAS MORE INTERESTED IN THE NATURE OF THE ARRAY AS A WHOLE AND EXPERIMENTALLY OPENED SEVERAL OF THE LEKYTHOI AND PHALERONS AT RANDOM WITH A VIEW TO A ROUGH GENERALISATION
YOU0000005530_S0000053 WILLETT WOULD POUR ONE INTO HIS HAND
YOU0000005530_S0000060 AND IT MADE MUCH TO BE FOUNDE IN CASE OF TROUBLE
YOU0000005530_S0000067 THOSE GUARDS ACCORDING TO HUTCHINSON OR HIS AVATAR
YOU0000005530_S0000072 SO THAT WAS WHAT THESE LEKYTHOI CONTAINED THE MONSTROUS FRUIT OF UNHALLOWED RITES AND DEEDS
YOU0000005530_S0000077 AND FOR A MOMENT FELT AN IMPULSE TO FLEE IN PANIC FROM THAT CAVERN OF HIDEOUS SHELVES WITH THEIR SILENT AND PERHAPS WATCHING SENTINELS
YOU0000005530_S0000083 AS POOR CHARLES HAD HINTED IN HIS FRANTIC NOTE ALL CIVILISATION ALL NATURAL LAW PERHAPS EVEN THE FATE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE UNIVERSE'
YOU0000005530_S0000089 THAT DREAMERS SEE FIXED ABOVE THE ARCHWAY OF A CERTAIN BLACK TOWER STANDING ALONE IN TWILIGHT AND WILLETT DID NOT LIKE WHAT HIS FRIEND RANDOLPH CARTER HAD SAID OF ITS POWERS
YOU0000005530_S0000095 SO IT WAS HERE THAT THE YOUTH HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED BY THE FINAL SUMMONS
YOU0000005530_S0000101 THERE WAS NOTHING ALIVE HERE TO HARM HIM AND HE WOULD NOT BE STAYED IN HIS PIERCING OF THE ELDRITCH CLOUD WHICH ENGULFED HIS PATIENT
YOU0000005530_S0000106 ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS THE TABLE WITH A POWERFUL ARGAND LAMP
YOU0000005530_S0000112 RAIS'D YOG-SOTHOTH THRICE AND WAS YE NEXTE DAY DELIVER'D
YOU0000005530_S0000117 BOTH OF WHICH WERE THICKLY COVERED WITH MYSTIC SYMBOLS AND FORMULAE ROUGHLY CHISELLED IN THE SMOOTH DRESSED STONE
YOU0000005530_S0000122 ITS TAG NUMBERED ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN
YOU0000005530_S0000129 HOWEVER
YOU0000005530_S0000135 THIS WAS ON THE LEFT-HAND WALL AS ONE ENTERED THE ROOM
YOU0000005530_S0000140 AS IF OLD CURWEN HAD HAD A DIFFERENT WAY OF RECORDING SOUND
YOU0000005530_S0000150 THE LAMPS WERE SPUTTERING WOEFULLY
YOU0000005530_S0000156 HE TURNED FROM THE INSCRIPTIONS TO FACE THE ROOM WITH ITS BIZARRE CONTENTS
YOU0000005530_S0000167 AND STOPP NOT TO BE SURE WHEN THERE IS ANY DOUBTE OF WHOM YOU HAVE
YOU0000005530_S0000172 HENCE HE HAS MADE NO ATTEMPT TO TELL IT BEYOND HIS MOST INTIMATE CIRCLE
YOU0000005530_S0000180 AND AGAIN THE NEXT DAY
YOU0000005530_S0000186 THAT BEARD
YOU0000005530_S0000191 AND ONLY A FAINT ACRID ODOUR REMINDED MR WARD OF WHAT HE HAD SMELT ON HIS SON THAT DAY HE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL
YOU0000005530_S0000196 UNDERNEATH THE SMOOTH CONCRETE WAS STILL VISIBLE
YOU0000005530_S0000204 AND SMELL IT
YOU0000005530_S0000209 AND NODDED IN TURN
YOU0000005530_S0000214 THERE WAS NOTHING TO RELATE BEYOND THE LOOMING UP OF THAT FORM WHEN THE GREENISH-BLACK VAPOUR FROM THE KYLIX PARTED
YOU0000005530_S0000220 FOR IT SEEMED HARDLY FITTING FOR ANY HUMAN BRAIN TO ANSWER WHEN POWERS OF UNKNOWN SPHERES HAD SO VITALLY ENCROACHED ON THIS SIDE OF THE GREAT ABYSS
YOU0000005530_S0000226 AND WILLETT AGAIN LET SILENCE ANSWER FOR HIM
YOU0000005530_S0000231 TORN OBVIOUSLY FROM THE CHEAP PAD IN THAT FABULOUS ROOM OF HORROR SOMEWHERE UNDERGROUND
YOU0000005530_S0000237 YET HAVING COMBINATIONS OF SYMBOLS WHICH SEEMED VAGUELY FAMILIAR
YOU0000005530_S0000243 THEY WERE THE POINTED SAXON MINUSCULES OF THE EIGHTH OR NINTH CENTURY A D
YOU0000005530_S0000249 WILLETT AND MR WARD WERE MUTE AND BAFFLED
YOU0000005530_S0000255 THE DOCTOR RESTED TOWARD MORNING
YOU0000005530_S0000260 IT SEEMED CERTAIN THAT THE CURWEN WHO MUST BE DESTROYED COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE BEARDED AND SPECTACLED STRANGER
YOU0000005530_S0000267 WAS NOT ALLEN PLANNING TO MURDER YOUNG WARD UPON THE ADVICE OF THE CREATURE CALLED HUTCHINSON
YOU0000005530_S0000274 THE PHYSICIAN EMPLOYED AS MUCH DRAMATIC EFFECT AS HE COULD
YOU0000005530_S0000281 THEN HE WHISPERED
YOU0000005530_S0000287 KILL EVERYTHING OFF WOULD HE
YOU0000005530_S0000293 YET ALMOST CONVINCED AGAINST HIS WILL HE WENT ON WITH HIS TALE IN THE HOPE THAT SOME INCIDENT MIGHT STARTLE HIS AUDITOR OUT OF THE MAD COMPOSURE HE MAINTAINED
YOU0000005530_S0000299 AND HE VENTURED THE MILD STATEMENT THAT THOSE NOTES WERE OLD ONES
YOU0000005530_S0000304 YOU HAD NOT BEEN HERE TO TELL ME THIS TWAS NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN
YOU0000005530_S0000310 AS WARD CROAKED THE WORDS HIS VOICE SEEMED ALMOST TO BURST FREE OF ITS TRAMMELS AND SINK TO CAVERNOUS ABYSSES OF UNCANNY RESONANCE
YOU0000005530_S0000316 WITHOUT WARNING
YOU0000005530_S0000322 IN REVIVING THE PATIENT MUMBLED MANY TIMES OF SOME WORD WHICH HE MUST GET TO ORNE AND HUTCHINSON AT ONCE SO WHEN HIS CONSCIOUSNESS SEEMED FULLY BACK THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM THAT OF THOSE STRANGE CREATURES AT LEAST ONE WAS HIS BITTER ENEMY AND HAD GIVEN DR ALLEN ADVICE FOR HIS ASSASSINATION
YOU0000005530_S0000327 TO WHICH THE YOUTH ONLY REPLIED THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS VERY SAFELY TAKEN CARE OF AND COULD DO NO ONE ANY HARM EVEN IF HE WISHED
YOU0000005530_S0000332 A CURIOUS SEQUEL TO THE MATTER OF ORNE AND HUTCHINSON
YOU0000005530_S0000340 THE WRITER FELT ABLE TO FIND AND DEAL WITH ORNE AND HUTCHINSON ITSELF
YOU0000005538_S0000013 THEY WERE NOT GIVEN CITIZENSHIP THEY WERE CONSIDERED AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM BANGLADESH

YOU0000005572_S0000473 AND OUR JOB IS TO WRITE A GREAT LIFE TO HAVE A GREAT LEGACY TO INSPIRE MANY PEOPLE
YOU0000005572_S0000479 AND MY ENGLISH TEACHER TOLD ME I WAS THE WEAKEST WRITER SHE EVER MET IN HER ENTIRE LIFE
YOU0000005572_S0000486 AND MY SPEECH TEACHER SAID QUOTE UNQUOTE MS NICHOLS
YOU0000005572_S0000491 AND TO HOLD ON AND LOVE YOU A BIT
YOU0000005580_S0000012 OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS DR DAVINA PASSERI
YOU0000005580_S0000017 OUR NEXT PANELIST IS PATRICK LUCE
YOU0000005580_S0000022 FINALLY
YOU0000005580_S0000028 AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND TAKING YOUR EVENING TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS CONVERSATION
YOU0000005580_S0000033 ALSO WE ARE IN THE TAMPA BAY REGION IN ST PETERSBURG CLEARWATER AND AROUND THE AREA AND THERE'S A STORM BREWING
YOU0000005580_S0000044 I'M POINTING TO IT I THINK THAT MEANS YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT
YOU0000005580_S0000053 I'M READY
YOU0000005580_S0000059 SO I THOUGHT THAT THE DOCUMENTARY SINKING CITIES MIAMI WAS REALLY WELL DONE
YOU0000005580_S0000068 AND SO THESE CHANGES TO OUR COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS LIKE BEACHES AND ESTUARIES WILL HAVE IMPACT TO OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES
YOU0000005580_S0000074 WE CAN SEE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE BOTH AN ECONOMIC IMPACT BUT ALSO AN ECOLOGIC IMPACT
YOU0000005580_S0000079 AND ACTUALLY RESULT IN MORE EROSION TO NEARBY AREAS
YOU0000005580_S0000087 BUT MIAMI IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE ONLY CITIES IN FLORIDA THAT NOT ONLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SEA LEVEL RISE IS HAPPENING BUT HAS AN ACTIVE BAN IN PLACE FOR HOW TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE
YOU0000005580_S0000102 WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT COASTAL RESILIENCE AS A NECESSITY RATHER THAN AN OPTION
YOU0000005580_S0000107 THANK YOU
YOU0000005580_S0000117 AND WE NEED SOME PLAN IN PLACE TO START FIXING IT
YOU0000005580_S0000131 WE'RE NOT GOING TO IMPACT ANYONE ELSE'S USE OF IT SO THIS IS WHY WE GET INTO THIS REGION WHERE WE HAVE THIS PUBLIC GOOD THAT THEN NEEDS PROVISION BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO HELP US MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A GOOD PLAN IN PLACE
YOU0000005580_S0000138 RIGHT WE COULD SPEND INFINITES AMOUNTS OF DOLLARS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE NO IMPACT AT ALL
YOU0000005580_S0000148 AGAIN TO HELP ABATE THE IMPACTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE
YOU0000005580_S0000160 AND SO THESE ARE HUGE DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THAT TO OUR DAILY LIVES AND WHO PAYS AND HOW THEY PAY FOR IT
YOU0000005580_S0000165 AND THEN DISPERSE IT AMONGST ALL OF THE DIFFERENT INITIATIVES THAT THE CITY HAS WHETHER IT'S
YOU0000005580_S0000171 AND SO EFFECTIVELY WHAT AN ASSESSMENT WILL DO IS CREATE AN ANNUAL NON AD-VALOREM TAX THAT'S BASED UPON THE COST AND BENEFIT DRIVERS RELATIVE TO A SPECIFIC PROPERTY
YOU0000005580_S0000176 AND SO WITH THE PROPERTY TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS
YOU0000005580_S0000184 AND THE REASON WHY WE DO THIS ALL IS BECAUSE WE WANT TO HELP PROTECT OUR LOCAL ECONOMY
YOU0000005580_S0000195 AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THINGS TO PROTECT OUR ECONOMY
YOU0000005580_S0000210 IS THAT WE HAVE SOME ECONOMIC DRIVERS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THAT IN THE RIGHT WAY IN THE MOST ETHICAL WAY
YOU0000005580_S0000219 IS THAT THROUGH A WHOLE HOST OF DIFFERENT REASONS PRIMARILY ECONOMIC BUT ALSO OTHER SOCIAL ISSUES
YOU0000005580_S0000233 IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES
YOU0000005580_S0000251 AND ALL OF THE DISRUPTION TO THE AREA THAT WENT ALONG TO IT DURING THAT TIME THAT IT TOOK TO DO IT
YOU0000005580_S0000267 THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO DEFINE HAPPINESS AND GOOD OF COURSE
YOU0000005580_S0000280 IS THAT THE PRIMARY RIGHT THAT COMES TO MIND THAT EVERYBODY THINKS OF IS THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY
YOU0000005580_S0000290 SO THAT IF WE OWE
YOU0000005580_S0000311 FOR THOSE OF YOU ALL WHO HAD SOME CHALLENGES IN THE BEGINNING WITH WIFI OR STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES AGAIN
YOU0000005580_S0000326 AND SO I THINK IT MIGHT CAUSE A SLOWDOWN BUT MAYBE NOT THE SIZE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE PLANNING THAT WILL GO ON
YOU0000005580_S0000346 SO THAT'S GOING TO HAVE EFFECTS FOR TOURISM
YOU0000005580_S0000365 IS THAT IT REALLY DEPENDS
YOU0000005580_S0000380 THAT'S DONE BY A COMPONENT OF THESE STUDIES TO HANDLE THE FINANCIAL ELEMENT OF FUNDING THESE PLANS
YOU0000005580_S0000386 IS THAT ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE PINELLAS COUNTY RESILIENCE PLANS AND CAN YOU MAYBE HELP FLESH THAT OUT
YOU0000005580_S0000394 SO ONE QUESTION THAT CAME IN WAS TO DIFFERENTIATE ACT AND RULE UTILITARIANISM THAT SOME OF OUR ETHICS STUDENTS THAT ARE JOINING US ARE ASKING ABOUT
YOU0000005580_S0000402 THAT MAYBE SOME SORT OF MANDATE IS THE RIGHT ANSWER TO THIS
YOU0000005580_S0000416 TO KIND OF JUMP RIGHT OFF OF THAT
YOU0000005580_S0000426 BUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT BEING WELL INFORMED I WAS WRITING ISSUES AND QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS AS WE WRAPPED UP FOR THE VERY END BUT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO DISCUSS THEM NOW
YOU0000005580_S0000437 IT DOESN'T MEMORIALIZE INTO POLICY THAT'S MEANINGFUL
YOU0000005580_S0000442 WE ARE FACING CHALLENGES RELATED TO SEA LEVEL RISE AND RESILIENCY
YOU0000005580_S0000462 NOT JUST FROM STORM EVENTS BUT FROM SEA LEVEL RISE AS WELL
YOU0000005580_S0000473 THEN WE MAY NOT HAVE THE ISSUES DOWN THE ROAD THAT WE'RE FORECASTING AND FORESEEING
YOU0000005580_S0000479 BUT THEY MAY NOT PRODUCE THE DESIRED RESULTS

YOU0000005620_S0000286 I WOULDN'T BE BUILDING UP THE SEO VALUE OVER TIME IT'S LIKE I CHOPPED DOWN THE EVERGREEN TREE AND STARTED FROM A STUPID LITTLE SEED AGAIN INSTEAD OF DOMINATING THE SEARCH BY UPDATING AND CREATING THE ANCHORED PIECE OF CONTENT
YOU0000005620_S0000292 SO FAR ACCORDING TO GOOGLE

YOU0000005628_S0000007 WHILE I HAVE FAMILY FROM THE SOUTH AND I'VE WORKED AS AN ACTRESS AND MODEL IN THIS MARKET FOR A FEW YEARS
YOU0000005628_S0000014 NASHVILLE THEATRICALITY
YOU0000005628_S0000036 MOVES IT FORWARDS AND THEN THE SIDE-TO-SIDE TURNS RIGHT AND LEFT THERE IT IS JUST LIKE THAT EXCELLENT
YOU0000005628_S0000055 WE ARE EVEN NOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF RAINY AND DRIZZLY TODAY WELL ALL THAT RAIN IS BEING COLLECTED INTO A CISTERN RIGHT NOW AND WE'LL BE USING THAT FOR OUR LANDSCAPING
YOU0000005628_S0000062 ALONG WITH A COLLECTION OF CAVES
YOU0000005628_S0000074 I SAW A SMALL SAMPLE OF THE ALMOST THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILLION VISITORS THAT COME TO THIS ATTRACTION EACH YEAR YOUNG AND OLD EVERYONE WAS INTERESTED AND IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY
YOU0000005628_S0000080 AND TWENTY SIX POINT TWO TWO MILE MARATHON RUN THAT MAKES UP THE EVENT
YOU0000005628_S0000085 I'M HOPING COMPETITOR STEPHANIE WELDON CAN GIVE ME SOME INSIGHT INTO WHAT MAKES THIS CITY SO GREAT FROM RACE DAY
YOU0000005628_S0000099 BUT THE WEATHER IS USUALLY REALLY GOOD AND VERY SCENIC IT'S ALWAYS THIS TIME OF YEAR RIGHT
YOU0000005628_S0000118 AND THEN
YOU0000005628_S0000135 THE STORIES I'M ABOUT TO HEAR WILL SPOOK ME EVEN MORE THAN STEPHANIE'S SCHEDULE FOR RACE DAY
YOU0000005628_S0000157 I WAS WALKING BACK TO THE BACK OF THE ROOM AND IT FELT LIKE SOMETHING TRIPPED ME
YOU0000005628_S0000163 OH REALLY YEAH OH WOW
YOU0000005628_S0000180 THAT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT LOUD OF A SOUND
YOU0000005628_S0000195 I COULDN'T HAVE EXPLORED THE HISTORY OF HALES BAR WITHOUT THE HELP OF PAT JEFF AND THE TEAM
YOU0000005628_S0000200 SO THIS MORNING I'M CONNECTING WITH TIM MORGAN
YOU0000005628_S0000221 WHETHER THAT'S YOUTH SOCCER
YOU0000005628_S0000230 BEFORE LEAVING CHATTANOOGA TO RETURN HOME
YOU0000005628_S0000259 THIS CITY HOLDS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF HISTORY AND THE PEOPLE WHO CALL IT HOME ARE EAGER TO SHARE IT
YOU0000005636_S0000011 BUT TO WRITERS AND FAMILIES WHO DEPEND ON THEM FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT
YOU0000005636_S0000016 TYPICALLY ARE SOLD TOGETHER AS A SINGLE COLLECTION
YOU0000005636_S0000022 STAKES ARE HIGH
YOU0000005636_S0000027 BUYERS ALSO ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE TO OBTAIN THEIR PREFERRED COLLECTION
YOU0000005636_S0000033 MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE DRIVEN BY HISTORY TOO
YOU0000005636_S0000042 THESE ARE THE MIDDLEMEN
YOU0000005636_S0000049 AT THIS POINT HOROWITZ FOUND THE BENEFIT OF TARGETING BUYERS WITH WHAT HE CALLED DEEP CHAMPAGNE POCKETS
YOU0000005636_S0000063 ALTHOUGH HE RARELY DISCUSSES HIS PHILOSOPHY AS A DEALER
YOU0000005636_S0000072 AS A DEALER HOROWITZ STATED THAT HIS ROLE IS TO BROKER A MARRIAGE BETWEEN AN UNINFORMED SELLER
YOU0000005636_S0000077 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ANOTHER
YOU0000005636_S0000088 HENRY HOLT DESCRIBED ALL AGENTS AS CONTEMPTIBLE INTERLOPERS AND PESTS
YOU0000005636_S0000094 A MINDSET THAT SOCIOLOGISTS WOULD DESCRIBE AS A HABITUS
YOU0000005636_S0000102 MUSICAL OR ARTISTIC COMPOSITION A LETTER OR MEMORANDUM
YOU0000005636_S0000109 WILEY GREW UP IN A FAMILY OF PUBLISHERS AND BANKERS
YOU0000005636_S0000115 THIRTEEN OF THE NORTON WRITERS WHO ARE FROM MY DATA SET APPEAR IN HIS CLIENT LIST
YOU0000005636_S0000122 HARRY RANSOM AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR AND ASSISTANT DEAN REALIZED THAT TEXAS'S UPSTART LIBRARY COULD NEVER MATCH THE AQUARIAN ANTIQUARIAN COLLECTIONS OF EUROPEAN AND IVY LEAGUE UNIVERSITIES
YOU0000005636_S0000128 RANSOM'S PITCH TO THE STATE OF TEXAS WAS SUCCESSFUL NOT ONLY BECAUSE TEXAS WANTED TO PROVE THAT IT HAD INTERNATIONAL CULTURAL CAPITAL BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES AS A NATION WAS ENGAGED IN THE SAME STRUGGLE
YOU0000005636_S0000135 SO YOU CAN SEE WE'RE PING-PONGING AROUND THE MOST IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS IN THE MARKET
YOU0000005636_S0000143 TEXAS AND YALE PROVIDE CONTRASTING EXAMPLES OF THE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN LITERARY ARCHIVES MARKET
YOU0000005636_S0000149 FOR EXAMPLE WHEN HE WANTED TO BUY EZRA POUND'S PAPERS
YOU0000005636_S0000154 AND I HAVE TO ADMIT WHEN I WAS DOING THIS RESEARCH I FOUND THIS HILARIOUS THAT YALE WAS WHINING ABOUT TEXAS HAVING MORE MONEY BECAUSE OF OIL
YOU0000005636_S0000162 RANSOM CEDED HIS INTEREST AND ALLOWED GALLUP TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL BID AND A RELATIVELY RARE CASE OF INSTITUTIONAL COLLABORATION
YOU0000005636_S0000171 SO SORRY WILLIAM MCPHERON
YOU0000005636_S0000180 WHO ACTED QUICKLY DURING A TIME OF INSTITUTIONAL TRANSITION
YOU0000005636_S0000187 THEY LOOKED WORN EVEN WHEN NEW DUE TO BEING POORLY MANUFACTURED
YOU0000005636_S0000193 WHEREVER GINSBERG'S ORIGINAL ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIALS WAS ENCOUNTERED THE ORDER WAS RETAINED
YOU0000005636_S0000201 DECIDING THAT HE WOULD OBTAIN THE MOST PROFIT BY SELLING HIS PAPERS TO WHICHEVER INSTITUTION COULD KEEP THEM TOGETHER WHILE PAYING THE MOST
YOU0000005636_S0000207 BILL MORGAN
YOU0000005636_S0000215 I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I DID NOT NECESSARILY RECEIVE PUSHBACK FROM INSTITUTIONS
YOU0000005636_S0000224 YEAH ABSOLUTELY
YOU0000005636_S0000233 HOWEVER WHAT I WILL SAY AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THIS TALK DOESN'T GET INTO TOO MUCH BUT IF YOU BUY THE BOOK I DO TALK ABOUT IT
YOU0000005636_S0000242 YES
YOU0000005636_S0000254 NOT THEIR CULTURAL VALUE
YOU0000005636_S0000262 AREN'T PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OBLIGATED TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THIS INFORMATION
YOU0000005636_S0000277 THAT'S TOTALLY FINE
YOU0000005636_S0000288 BUT I REALIZED THAT THE BETTER STORY WAS LARGER AND THAT LARGER STORY NEEDED TO COME FROM DATA
YOU0000005636_S0000295 I GAVE A TALK JUST ON THIS IN LONDON ABOUT HOW OUR BEST RESOURCE TO FINDING ARCHIVES IN THE US IS JUST ONE GUY WORKING PART-TIME TO CREATE ARCHIVEGRID AND WE SHOULD ALL BE SUPER THANKFUL TO HIM
YOU0000005636_S0000338 SPACE COSTS A LOT OF MONEY
YOU0000005636_S0000346 THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO
YOU0000005636_S0000364 AND WE'LL SEE YOU ALL NEXT TIME TAKE CARE

YOU0000005644_S0000103 I ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S YESTERDAY'S TECHNOLOGY AND THERE'S SOMETHING IN WHICH THERE'S A REAL-TIME I MEAN
YOU0000005644_S0000111 IS NEXT TO ARKANSAS AND NEXT TO TEXAS NOW YOU'VE GOT TO INTEGRATE THREE
YOU0000005644_S0000118 TO BE TRANSMITTED TO FOLKS SUCH AS I

YOU0000005652_S0000157 THESE DETENTION CAMPS IN NORTHERN SYRIA ARE NOW HOME TO THOUSANDS OF RADICALIZED WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN
YOU0000005652_S0000165 ONE OF THEM IS THIS MAN
YOU0000005652_S0000175 THEY ARE IN CAPTIVITY BECAUSE THEY WENT OVERSEAS FROM CANADA TO PARTICIPATE AND FACILITATE IN THE ACTIVITIES OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THAT IS A CRIME

YOU0000005652_S0000431 BUT WITHOUT A SUBSTANTIVE PLAN IN CANADA WHICH NOW APPEARS TO BE THE CASE
YOU0000005652_S0000437 IF TOMORROW THE CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER DECIDED TO BECOME A MUSLIM AND IMPLEMENT SHARIA IN CANADA FINE AND WELL
YOU0000005652_S0000446 THERE'S NOW TALK OF A PROPOSAL TO THE UN

YOU0000005668_S0000007 IT IS PATROLLED BY THE NINETY FOURTH PRECINCT OF THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT
YOU0000005668_S0000023 JONATHAN PROVOOST SON-IN-LAW OF PIETER PRAA AND HIS FAMILY FARMED THE EASTERN PORTION OF GREENPOINT AND LIVED IN THE HOUSE BUILT BY PRAA
YOU0000005668_S0000045 SUCH CLAIMS FROM RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN RESISTED BY OIL INDUSTRY SUPPORTERS THROUGH REFERENCES TO APPARENTLY CONFLICTING DATA AND DEFERRALS OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY AMONG OTHER STRATEGIES
YOU0000005668_S0000068 THIS IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE MEDIAN LIFE EXPECTANCY OF EIGHTY ONE POINT TWO FOR ALL NEW YORK CITY NEIGHBORHOODS
YOU0000005668_S0000087 THE SOUTHERN PART OF GREENPOINT IS SERVED BY ENGINE CO
YOU0000005668_S0000103 ADDITIONALLY SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN GREENPOINT AND WILLIAMSBURG GRADUATE ON TIME HIGHER THAN THE CITYWIDE AVERAGE OF SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF STUDENTS

YOU0000005668_S0000177 DEAD PRESIDENTS
YOU0000005668_S0000182 THE SIEGE

YOU0000005676_S0000022 AND TODAY HE WILL SPEAK ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND POLICIES AND HOW THEY ARE AND ARE NOT ADDRESSING THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF COVID NINETEEN
YOU0000005676_S0000035 DR SINGH IS A NOTED DISABILITY RIGHTS ACTIVIST
YOU0000005676_S0000041 THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADITI
YOU0000005676_S0000048 IN THE US
YOU0000005676_S0000054 HE ALSO WAS SLOW TO TAKE THE CONCERNS OF HIS ADVISORS SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE PANDEMIC
YOU0000005676_S0000059 THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL HAD CREATED THE INITIAL TEST AND IT WAS FAULTY
YOU0000005676_S0000066 THE INITIAL CRITERIA WERE THAT YOU HAD TO HAVE REALLY BEEN IN CHINA OR IN WUHAN AS A MAJOR RISK FACTOR
YOU0000005676_S0000074 AND HERE YOU MIGHT THINK OF MULTIPLE LEVELS OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS
YOU0000005676_S0000088 FROM A SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE
YOU0000005676_S0000096 SO THERE ARE ADDITIONAL POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS
YOU0000005676_S0000108 SECOND IS THAT IT'S CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S AN ADEQUATE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DOING THINGS LIKE IDENTIFICATION CASES AND CONTACT TRACING
YOU0000005676_S0000116 BUT YOU CAN'T FOOL MOTHER NATURE
YOU0000005676_S0000123 SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'LL COME BACK FOR DISCUSSION
YOU0000005676_S0000129 SO THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IN EVERY COUNTRY
YOU0000005676_S0000147 AND SO IN NORMAL TIMES
YOU0000005676_S0000154 BUT IT'S ALSO A RISK
YOU0000005676_S0000174 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A PATIENT HAS DIABETES
YOU0000005676_S0000194 FOR THE FUTURE
YOU0000005676_S0000205 AND IT'S CLEAR THAT GOING FORWARD
YOU0000005676_S0000220 REPRESENTS A POPULATION THAT HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES
YOU0000005676_S0000230 A NATIONAL
YOU0000005676_S0000240 THE HIGHER THE NUMBER OF CASES AND THE HIGHER THE NUMBER OF DEATHS
YOU0000005676_S0000251 I THINK WHAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT
YOU0000005676_S0000260 AND SO THIS IS A DOUBLE CHALLENGE
YOU0000005676_S0000268 AND IN THAT GROUP OF MINORITIES
YOU0000005676_S0000278 THOSE WORKERS ARE
YOU0000005676_S0000287 IN SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST NEED
YOU0000005676_S0000302 AND IN CHICAGO
YOU0000005676_S0000322 REAL-WORLD THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TODAY ON THE GROUND THEY DON'T REQUIRE FEDERAL ACTION
YOU0000005676_S0000332 IN THAT WAY WE ARE THE WORLD'S LARGEST MINORITY
YOU0000005676_S0000342 MOST OF THE TIME WHEN REPORTERS TALK ABOUT COVID NINETEEN PREPAREDNESS
YOU0000005676_S0000349 IN THE STATE OF KERALA IN INDIA AN ELDERLY COUPLE AGED NINETY THREE AND EIGHTY EIGHT YEARS WERE INFECTED
YOU0000005676_S0000364 AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON CAREGIVERS
YOU0000005676_S0000370 WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH ADVISORIES ARE ACCESSIBLE THROUGH SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION
YOU0000005676_S0000379 LOCKDOWN HAS FURTHER ENSURED THE LOSS OF WORK AND INCOME
YOU0000005676_S0000388 THE EMERGING FIELD OF DISABILITY ETHICS CAN HELP POLICYMAKERS IN EMPLOYING ANTI-DISCRIMINATORY APPROACHES TO VALUE DISABLED LIVES AND TRIAGE DECISIONS
YOU0000005676_S0000395 AND I'M WONDERING TO MYSELF HOW DID THIS HAPPEN HOW DID THE US
YOU0000005676_S0000402 AND SO WE LOST THREE WEEKS RIGHT THERE
YOU0000005676_S0000425 THIS ALLOWS FOR
YOU0000005676_S0000443 THERE'S A PREPONDERANCE OF THAT IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY
YOU0000005676_S0000464 THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING THEM AS MUCH IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING SO PEOPLE MAY BE HAVING SYMPTOMS AND STAYING AT HOME FOR FEAR OF NOT WANTING TO GO INTO THE HOSPITAL
YOU0000005676_S0000480 GREAT THANK YOU I MIGHT COME BACK TO THE MENTAL HEALTH IN A BIT
YOU0000005676_S0000498 THERE ARE MANY DISABLED PEOPLE WHO RELY ON CAREGIVERS
YOU0000005676_S0000521 SO

YOU0000005708_S0000017 KAROL JOZEF WOJTYLA WAS BORN IN THE POLISH TOWN OF WADOWICE
YOU0000005708_S0000035 WHILE TEACHING HE GATHERED A GROUP OF ABOUT TWENTY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO BEGAN TO CALL THEMSELVES RODZINKA THE LITTLE FAMILY
YOU0000005708_S0000045 AND HE CONTINUED TO LIVE A SIMPLE LIFE SHUNNING THE TRAPPINGS THAT CAME WITH HIS POSITION AS BISHOP
YOU0000005708_S0000069 HIS MESSAGE
YOU0000005708_S0000079 THEY ALSO HOPED THAT IF THE POPE ABIDED BY THE RULES THEY SET THAT THE POLISH PEOPLE WOULD SEE HIS EXAMPLE AND FOLLOW THEM AS WELL
YOU0000005708_S0000084 HE WAS A POLE BUT BEYOND THE REGIME'S REACH
YOU0000005708_S0000089 MILLIONS SHOUTED IN RESPONSE WE WANT GOD
YOU0000005708_S0000094 BUT AS POLITICAL LEADERS THEY WERE FINISHED
YOU0000005708_S0000125 BUT RATHER
YOU0000005708_S0000136 THE CONVERGENCE NEITHER SOUGHT NOR FABRICATED OF THE RESULTS OF WORK THAT WAS CONDUCTED INDEPENDENTLY IS IN ITSELF A SIGNIFICANT ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF THIS THEORY
YOU0000005708_S0000175 IT INSTITUTED A NUMBER OF REFORMS IN THE PROCESS OF RUNNING THE ROMAN CURIA
YOU0000005708_S0000242 YOU ARE OUR DEARLY BELOVED BROTHERS AND IN A CERTAIN WAY IT COULD BE SAID THAT YOU ARE OUR ELDER BROTHERS
YOU0000005708_S0000261 ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS
YOU0000005708_S0000267 THE POPE LATER STATED THAT OUR LADY OF FATIMA HELPED KEEP HIM ALIVE THROUGHOUT HIS ORDEAL
YOU0000005708_S0000275 WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WILL HAVE TO REMAIN A SECRET BETWEEN HIM AND ME
YOU0000005708_S0000298 HIS DEATH WAS VERIFIED WHEN AN ELECTROCARDIOGRAM THAT RAN FOR TWENTY MINUTES SHOWED A FLATLINE
YOU0000005708_S0000318 SHE TOLD REPORTER GERRY SHAW I AM CURED BUT IT IS UP TO THE CHURCH TO SAY WHETHER IT WAS A MIRACLE OR NOT
YOU0000005708_S0000332 HE CAN THEN BE BEATIFIED
YOU0000005708_S0000358 JOHN PAUL CONDEMNED THE ARROGANCE OF PRIESTS THAT LED TO THE SCANDALS PRIESTS AND CANDIDATES FOR THE PRIESTHOOD OFTEN LIVE AT A LEVEL BOTH MATERIALLY AND EDUCATIONALLY SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THEIR FAMILIES AND THE MEMBERS OF THEIR OWN AGE GROUP
YOU0000005708_S0000373 AN OPUS DEI SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THE INFLUENCE OF OPUS DEI IN THE VATICAN HAS BEEN EXAGGERATED
YOU0000005708_S0000405 THE PAIR EXCHANGED PERSONAL LETTERS OVER THIRTY YEARS AND STOURTON BELIEVES THAT TYMIENIECKA HAD CONFESSED HER LOVE FOR WOJTYLA
YOU0000005716_S0000003 I'M MARCIA DAY CHILDRESS FROM THE CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL ETHICS AND HUMANITIES HERE IN THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE
YOU0000005716_S0000011 DR KOPPAKA RAO EMIGRATED TO THE US WHERE HE BUILT A CAREER IN PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND AS A PROFESSOR OF PHARMACY
YOU0000005716_S0000016 JAYA RAO AND ROM KOPPAKA
YOU0000005716_S0000022 THEIR CARE TEAM COMMUNICATION WITH THE FAMILY COULD HAVE
YOU0000005716_S0000030 AND WE'VE LOOKED ESPECIALLY TO HOW PERSONS EXPRESS CARE AND CONNECTEDNESS TOWARD ONE ANOTHER
YOU0000005716_S0000035 INCLUDING THIS ONE
YOU0000005716_S0000041 ALL IN WHICH IS SPEARHEADED BY PEGGY PLEWS-OGAN WHO'S HERE WITH US TODAY
YOU0000005716_S0000046 SHE IS AN AMERICAN STUDIES SCHOLAR AND A LAWYER AND A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT FORDHAM UNIVERSITY
YOU0000005716_S0000054 AND THAT'S WHAT TO DO WHEN THE PATIENT IS RACIST
YOU0000005716_S0000059 A NURSE DOES AN INITIAL WORKUP SHE THINKS HIS CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUS
YOU0000005716_S0000068 AND SCENARIOS SUCH AS THIS ARE MUCH MORE COMMON THAN ONE WOULD THINK AND OCCUR AT HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN FACT
YOU0000005716_S0000073 SO FOR EXAMPLE
YOU0000005716_S0000080 ALONG WITH THEIR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
YOU0000005716_S0000086 WHICH REQUIRES HOSPITALS TO SCREEN AND STABILIZE PATIENTS IF NECESSARY IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION
YOU0000005716_S0000093 MANY HOSPITALS ALSO HAVE PATIENTS BILL OF RIGHTS DOCUMENTS WHICH INCLUDE EXPLICIT LANGUAGE ABOUT A PATIENT'S RIGHT TO REFUSE TREATMENT FROM AN UNWANTED PHYSICIAN
YOU0000005716_S0000098 BUT THEY ALSO HAVE EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS THAT HAVE TO BE RESPECTED
YOU0000005716_S0000110 I GET IT
YOU0000005716_S0000116 AND ON THE MEDICAL PROVIDER SIDE
YOU0000005716_S0000123 WILL THEY BE VIOLATING LAWS AGAINST BATTERY BY FORCING THE PATIENT TO BE TREATED BY AN UNWANTED DOCTOR WITHOUT CONSENT
YOU0000005716_S0000128 WHAT DO YOU DO
YOU0000005716_S0000137 SO I DECIDED TO RESEARCH THE ISSUE AND I INITIALLY FOCUSED MY RESEARCH ON IDENTIFYING THE LAWS THAT COULD BE USED TO ADDRESS THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR
YOU0000005716_S0000148 NURSES EXACTLY NURSES AND NURSING ASSISTANTS
YOU0000005716_S0000159 BUT IT DOESN'T ANSWER THE THRESHOLD NORMATIVE QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY SHOULD ACCOMMODATE
YOU0000005716_S0000166 THE PATIENT THEN BECOMES INCREASINGLY WITHDRAWN AND EVENTUALLY REFUSES TREATMENT ALTOGETHER
YOU0000005716_S0000173 THE HOSPITAL WAS IN HAWAII
YOU0000005716_S0000179 OK SO WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO THESE LET'S GO ON TO CASE STUDY THREE
YOU0000005716_S0000184 I WANT TO BE TREATED BY HIM
YOU0000005716_S0000190 PERHAPS SHE'D HAD A NEGATIVE PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH A NON-AFRICAN-AMERICAN DOCTOR
YOU0000005716_S0000196 SHE WANTS AN AMERICAN DOCTOR
YOU0000005716_S0000204 HOW IS THE PATIENT'S REQUEST IN SCENARIO THREE DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHERS
YOU0000005716_S0000211 LET'S GO BACK TO CASE STUDY TWO FOR A MOMENT
YOU0000005716_S0000219 BUT OTHER TIMES IT LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
YOU0000005716_S0000225 MANY STUDIES SHOW THAT THEY'RE NOT AS TRUSTING OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
YOU0000005716_S0000233 AND THIS WAS PARTICULARLY SO AMONG WHITE PHYSICIANS
YOU0000005716_S0000240 PHYSICIAN-PATIENT RACE CONCORDANCE CAN COUNTER THE EFFECTS OF PATIENT-PHYSICIAN BIAS STEREOTYPING
YOU0000005716_S0000248 BUT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE CARE TO ALL PATIENTS
YOU0000005716_S0000254 TO GET AT THIS
YOU0000005716_S0000265 MAYBE IT'S BIGOTRY SECOND CASE STUDY
YOU0000005716_S0000275 THAT'S IN FACT WHAT THE PHYSICIANS DID
YOU0000005716_S0000283 AND NONE OF THIS IS TO SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE CONCERNED ABOUT BIGOTRY AND RACISM ON THE PART OF SOME PATIENTS
YOU0000005716_S0000292 AND JUST AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO DO SO THE PATIENT'S FATHER SAID DON'T YOU TOUCH MY CHILD
YOU0000005716_S0000297 THE EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WEIGHT OF THE ENCOUNTER WILL LINGER
YOU0000005716_S0000305 SO THIS TELLS US SOMETHING
YOU0000005716_S0000313 BUT WHATEVER THEY DECIDE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE SUPERVISOR MODEL APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR
YOU0000005716_S0000321 DISABILITY STATUS
YOU0000005716_S0000328 OR FEELS LIKE THEY WON'T BE SUPPORTED
YOU0000005716_S0000334 HOW AFFECTED PERSONNEL ARE SUPPORTED
YOU0000005716_S0000342 MANY PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT THESE ALLEGATIONS TO LIGHT WORKED AT INSTITUTIONS THAT HAD ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICIES
YOU0000005716_S0000348 SO EVEN WITH THE BEST POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS IN PLACE
YOU0000005716_S0000356 THANKS VERY MUCH KIMANI
YOU0000005716_S0000368 THE MOTHER IMMEDIATELY GOT VERY UPSET AND SAID I DON'T WANT YOU TOUCHING MY CHILDREN I CAN'T HAVE A MAN TOUCHING MY CHILDREN I CAN'T HAVE A MAN IN THIS ROOM
YOU0000005716_S0000379 QUESTIONS
YOU0000005716_S0000392 NO BLACK PERSON IS TOUCHING MY MOTHER
YOU0000005716_S0000404 ABLE TO MANAGE HER BEHAVIOR SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING
YOU0000005716_S0000410 AND
YOU0000005716_S0000418 I ASKED TASHA
YOU0000005716_S0000424 AS THE SUPERVISOR OR CHARGER YOU GOT INVOLVED
YOU0000005716_S0000439 MISTAKING HIM FOR JANITORIAL SERVICE INSTEAD OF AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST
YOU0000005716_S0000450 AND I BECAME KIND OF ONE OF OUR
YOU0000005716_S0000463 I HOPE YOU'RE STILL CONSIDERING A CAREER IN MEDICINE AFTER ALL
YOU0000005716_S0000471 ONE WAS CANADIAN ONE WAS BRITISH THEY BOTH CAME FROM VERY DISCRETE YOU KNOW SORT OF CLOSE-MOUTHED CULTURES BOTH WHITE WOMEN
YOU0000005716_S0000478 ARE YOU A HOMOSEXUAL
YOU0000005716_S0000486 WHO HAD HAD A MILD STROKE AND WAS ALSO IN STAGE FOUR LUNG CANCER
YOU0000005716_S0000502 BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SEPARATE BEING A HUMAN FROM BEING A PHYSICIAN AND SO YOU REACT IN THE SAME WAY YOUR CORTISOL LEVELS INCREASE YOUR CATECHOLAMINES SURGE
YOU0000005716_S0000510 OF WHAT THE COST WOULD BE TO YOU AND HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE WAYS OF DEALING WITH THESE INSTANCES
YOU0000005716_S0000517 YOU ALSO ARE HIGHLIGHTING THAT THERE'S STILL SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE IN EDUCATING THOSE GOING INTO THE FIELD BUT THEN ALSO CHANGING THAT CULTURE OF THOSE ALREADY IN THE FIELD
YOU0000005716_S0000525 MY SISTER IS SEVERAL YEARS OLDER THAN I
YOU0000005716_S0000532 AND
YOU0000005716_S0000537 BECAUSE THE PATIENTS AREN'T GOING TO WANT YOU
YOU0000005716_S0000542 WAS I WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE
YOU0000005716_S0000551 AND THEY WOULD MAKE UP A CHINESE SOUNDING NAME
YOU0000005716_S0000558 MAYBE MY PROFESSOR WAS RIGHT
YOU0000005716_S0000563 AND SHE WAS A WONDERFUL DOCTOR
YOU0000005716_S0000569 WE'RE NOT KOREAN
YOU0000005716_S0000575 AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE IN THE ROOM OR HEAR ABOUT IT
YOU0000005716_S0000580 ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO
YOU0000005716_S0000586 THE ETHICAL IDEA IS THAT WE ARE THERE IN OUR PROFESSIONAL ROLE TO HELP PATIENTS IN NEED
YOU0000005716_S0000592 AND I THINK IT'S OK TO SET LIMITS REASONABLE LIMITS ON OBNOXIOUS DEMEANING
YOU0000005716_S0000597 AND HOSPITAL POLICIES HAVE GOT TO ALL BE THERE TO SUPPORT THE FRONT LINE WORKERS
YOU0000005716_S0000611 MAYBE UNREALISTIC COMMENT
YOU0000005716_S0000618 THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE CAN'T ACCEPT
YOU0000005716_S0000631 WHAT WILL DOCTORS BE
YOU0000005724_S0000009 HARRIS WEINSTOCK HOPED THAT THIS LECTURESHIP WOULD LEAD TO A BETTER LIFE FOR THOSE WHO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN COMMERCIAL PURSUITS
YOU0000005724_S0000014 AND THE SUCCESSFUL MEN OF BUSINESS WILL TAKE THE PLACE HITHERTO CONFINED TO THE PATRIOT
YOU0000005724_S0000020 AND THEY HAVE DELIVERED THE BARBARA WEINSTOCK MEMORIAL LECTURES ON THE MORALS OF TRADE
YOU0000005724_S0000028 RESOURCE ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
YOU0000005724_S0000033 DR LOVINS DROPPED OUT OF HARVARD AND OXFORD
YOU0000005724_S0000041 AND THANKS TO THOSE WHO MADE TODAY POSSIBLE
YOU0000005724_S0000046 DETERMINE OR SIGNAL THEIR VALUE
YOU0000005724_S0000051 BUT THERE ARE TWO OTHER KINDS THAT ARE MORE VALUABLE THAT IT TYPICALLY IGNORES AND OFTEN JUST LIQUIDATES NAMELY PEOPLE AND NATURE
YOU0000005724_S0000058 NOW WHEN OUR CO-AUTHOR OF THE BOOK NATURAL CAPITALISM IN NINETY NINE CHOSE THAT TITLE
YOU0000005724_S0000065 IT'S INTERNALLY INCONSISTENT
YOU0000005724_S0000072 THOUGH IT'S NICE TO HAVE ALL THESE LITTLE HELPERS WHEN WE DO
YOU0000005724_S0000081 THIS SORT OF SCARCITY IMPOSING CONSTRAINT IS NOT NEW
YOU0000005724_S0000089 ECONOMICS IS GOOD AT THIS IT TEACHES TO ECONOMIZE ON OUR SCARCEST RESOURCE
YOU0000005724_S0000095 ONE IS TO MAKE THINGS THE WAY NATURE DOES TO PRODUCE IN CLOSED LOOPS WITH NO WASTE WITH NO TOXICITY
YOU0000005724_S0000105 BUT ACTUALLY
YOU0000005724_S0000113 NATURE IS ROOTED IN A PLACE IN A BIOME
YOU0000005724_S0000120 INITIALLY THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF NATURAL CAPITALISM RADICAL RESOURCE PRODUCTIVITY
YOU0000005724_S0000127 AND IS STILL THERE SIX MONTHS LATER
YOU0000005724_S0000132 BUT WE'RE STILL WASTING NEARLY THAT MUCH
YOU0000005724_S0000140 WE HAVE VERY WELL-KNOWN WAYS TO MAKE OLD BUILDINGS SEVERAL FOLD MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT NEW BUILDINGS IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE MORE EFFICIENT BUT TYPICALLY AT LOWER COST
YOU0000005724_S0000149 AND IT WAS CHEAPER UPFRONT NOT TO PUT ONE IN
YOU0000005724_S0000161 TO SAVE ALSO NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE WATER HEATING ENERGY HALF THE WATER NINETY PERCENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD ELECTRICITY
YOU0000005724_S0000175 OR HERE'S A HOUSE IN STEAMY BANGKOK THAT PROVIDES SUPERIOR COMFORT WITH A TENTH OF NORMAL AIR-CONDITIONING ENERGY
YOU0000005724_S0000183 AS I ADD MORE INSULATION TO MY HOUSE IN THE ROCKIES AT FIRST I EXPERIENCED DIMINISHING RETURNS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW INSULATION WORKS
YOU0000005724_S0000191 INDUSTRY AND TRANSPORT
YOU0000005724_S0000199 IT WORKED BETTER IT COST LESS TO BUILD
YOU0000005724_S0000210 AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE WHICH WE ALSO HAVE NOT FOUND IN THE TEXTBOOKS IS TO START YOUR SAVINGS DOWNSTREAM
YOU0000005724_S0000217 SO I'LL SAVE THE MOST ENERGY AND THE MOST CAPITAL COST BY STARTING MY SAVINGS ALL THE WAY DOWNSTREAM
YOU0000005724_S0000222 LESS FRICTION
YOU0000005724_S0000231 ADD A SWEEP BEND AND IMAGINE A PIPE RUNNING DIAGONALLY THROUGH THE AIR WHAT AWFUL WORKMANSHIP
YOU0000005724_S0000239 TUNNELING THROUGH THE COST BARRIER IN A REPLICABLE WAY OF COURSE
YOU0000005724_S0000246 WE SHOWED HOW TO RETROFIT FOR A FORTY TWO PERCENT ENERGY SAVING IN THE MOST EFFICIENT REFINERY IN EUROPE WITH AN EXCELLENT PAYBACK
YOU0000005724_S0000254 YOU CERTAINLY GET BETTER MERCHANDISING AND FOOD SAFETY
YOU0000005724_S0000267 FOUR YEARS AGO MY TEAM PUBLISHED AN INDEPENDENT STUDY NOBODY'S ARGUING WITH CO-SPONSORED MAINLY BY THE PENTAGON CALLED WINNING THE OIL ENDGAME WRITTEN FOR BUSINESS AND MILITARY LEADERS AND BUILT AROUND COMPETITIVE STRATEGY BUSINESS CASES FOR FIVE SECTORS YOU CAN GET IT ALL FREE AT OUR OIL ENDGAME WEBSITE
YOU0000005724_S0000278 OIL IMPORTS FELL BY HALF
YOU0000005724_S0000293 AND WE WOULD GET TO SAVE A MILLION JOBS NOW PALPABLY AT RISK MAINLY IN THE CAR INDUSTRY
YOU0000005724_S0000298 THE BUSINESS LOGIC IS VERY COMPELLING
YOU0000005724_S0000311 AND A SMALLER TWO OR THREEFOLD SMALLER PROPULSION SYSTEM
YOU0000005724_S0000319 ONLY FIVE PERCENT OF THAT SIX PERCENT OR ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT OF THE FUEL ENERGY ENDS UP MOVING THE DRIVER
YOU0000005724_S0000332 AND YOU NOTICE THEY'RE SUSPENDED FROM RINGS LIKE AN AIR FRAME RATHER THAN BUILT UP FROM A TUB WHICH IS OUR HORSE AND BUGGY LEGACY IN THE CAR BUSINESS
YOU0000005724_S0000345 YOU CAN TELL FROM THE SOUND THAT PLASTICS HAVE REALLY CHANGED SINCE THE GRADUATE
YOU0000005724_S0000353 AT TWELVE BUCKS A BARREL SO
YOU0000005724_S0000366 SO THIS HIGHEST LEVERAGE THING WE CAN DO TO CARS LIGHTWEIGHTING IS ACTUALLY OFF AND RUNNING
YOU0000005724_S0000376 THE FIRST COUPLE OF MILLION PEOPLE TO DO THAT WILL PROBABLY EARN BACK THE WHOLE COST OF THE CAR
YOU0000005724_S0000387 WELL BOEING'S BOLD REPOST
YOU0000005724_S0000395 AND BETTER AERODYNAMICS AND ENGINES AND DESIGN INTEGRATION THEY GOT THIS BIG JUMP IN EFFICIENCY
YOU0000005724_S0000400 WITH THAT IN MIND MY TEAM HAS BEEN BUSY IMPLEMENTING THE OIL ENDGAME THROUGH WHAT WE CALL INSTITUTIONAL ACUPUNCTURE
YOU0000005724_S0000406 SPECIFICALLY
YOU0000005724_S0000418 AND INVULNERABLE
YOU0000005724_S0000426 SO THAT WILL FURTHER SPEED UP THE TRIPLED EFFICIENCY CARS TRUCKS AND PLANES
YOU0000005724_S0000433 SO IT WAS GRATIFYING TWO YEARS LATER TO SEE FORD MOTOR COMPANY HIRING THE HEAD OF BOEING COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES TO RUN FORD
YOU0000005724_S0000443 BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER TO SAVE FUEL THAN TO BUY FUEL EFFICIENCY IS CHEAPER THAN FUEL
YOU0000005724_S0000450 GUESS WHAT THEY WERE EIGHTY PERCENT DOWN EVEN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
YOU0000005724_S0000456 MAYBE THE RECORD HOLDER IS INTERFACE
YOU0000005724_S0000461 HOW FAST DO WE NEED TO DO THAT WELL
YOU0000005724_S0000466 CAN WE IMAGINE THREE OR FOUR PERCENT A YEAR DROP IN ENERGY INTENSITY WELL THE U S ROUTINELY DOES IT WITHOUT EVEN PAYING ATTENTION
YOU0000005724_S0000480 AND WHY SHOULD IT BE COSTLY
YOU0000005724_S0000492 AND IF THAT MEANS THAT YOU AVOID THIS VERY EXPENSIVE CARBON INTENSIVE STUFF HERE
YOU0000005724_S0000497 BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO'S RIGHT ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE GROUND BECAUSE WE OUGHT TO DO THE SAME THINGS ANYWAY JUST TO MAKE MONEY OR IMPROVE OUR SECURITY OR PROTECT THE CLIMATE
YOU0000005724_S0000509 ONLY FORTY TO SIXTY PERCENT SAVINGS AT A FEW CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR BUT STILL CHEAPER THAN JUST MAKING AND DELIVERING POWER FROM A POWER PLANT THAT COST NOTHING TO BUILD
YOU0000005724_S0000520 A THIRD OF THE WORLD'S NEW ELECTRICITY
YOU0000005724_S0000526 AND THIRTY OR FORTY TIMES AS MUCH CAPACITY AS NUCLEAR ADDED THAT'S THE ESSENTIALLY FLAT LINE HERE
YOU0000005724_S0000531 AND IN THE U S EVEN BEFORE THE CAPITAL COLLAPSE THERE WAS NOT ANY INVESTMENT CAPITAL AVAILABLE
YOU0000005724_S0000537 BUT THEN THE KEYSTONE STUDY SHOWED THE FUEL WAS GOING TO BE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE IN THE FUTURE
YOU0000005724_S0000545 YOU CAN DISPLACE BY SPENDING A DOLLAR IN DIFFERENT WAYS
YOU0000005724_S0000552 AND WELL DESIGNED EFFICIENCY WHICH IS LESS THAN HALF THAT COST IS WAY UP IN THE CEILING
YOU0000005724_S0000559 OTHERWISE WE'RE JUST MAKING THINGS WORSE REDUCING AND RETARDING CLIMATE PROTECTION
YOU0000005724_S0000568 DECENTRALIZED POWER BUT EVEN WITHOUT DOING THAT YOU CAN MAKE A GOOD CASE RIGHT NOW THAT EVEN PHOTOVOLTAICS HAVE ALREADY PASSED COST CROSSOVER
YOU0000005724_S0000575 OKAY
YOU0000005724_S0000582 AND TEACH THE SAME LAB TECHNIQUES SEPARATING THE TOXIC WASTE WE JUST MADE INTO THE PURE SIMPLE REAGENTS WE STARTED WITH
YOU0000005724_S0000591 AND SHOWED THAT FROM THOSE YOU COULD MAKE ANY COLOR
YOU0000005724_S0000604 TOUGHER THAN THE KEVLAR IN BULLETPROOF VESTS STRONGER THAN STEEL
YOU0000005724_S0000610 ADHESIVES USING GECKO FOOT NANO-HAIR TECHNOLOGY
YOU0000005724_S0000618 AND WHEN WE PUT THESE IN AN OPEN PUBLIC DATABASE
YOU0000005724_S0000626 NOW WE HAVE A BETTER TERM WE CALL THEM UNSALABLE PRODUCTION BECAUSE THIS FOCUSES OUR MINDS ON WHY ARE WE PRODUCING STUFF NOBODY WANTS LET'S DESIGN IT OUT
YOU0000005724_S0000634 HOW SAFE WOULD YOU MAKE YOUR EXPLOSIVES FACTORY IF YOU BUILT YOUR HOUSE NEXT TO IT
YOU0000005724_S0000642 AND IF THEY OWNED IT THEY WOULD GET THE SAVINGS FROM ITS BEING THEY FELT MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE RELIABLE THAN COMPETING ONES
YOU0000005724_S0000647 THE CHEAPER THE DISSOLVING GETS THE LESS THEY CHARGE YOU THE MORE MARKET SHARE THEY GET
YOU0000005724_S0000657 SO LET ME TIE THIS TOGETHER
YOU0000005724_S0000666 BUT THEN HE GOT TO THINKING ABOUT CLOSED-LOOP PRODUCTION AND THEY CAME UP WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL CARPET WHICH TURNED OUT TO HAVE A FEW ISSUES BUT THE BASIC CONCEPT IS SOUND

YOU0000005780_S0000101 ALMIGHTY GOD IS THE ONE TRUE GOD WHO COMES TO JUDGE AND SAVE ALL OF MANKIND YEAH
YOU0000005780_S0000108 MEANING THAT GOD WOULD APPEAR IN THE FLESH TO CARRY OUT HIS WORK
YOU0000005780_S0000116 IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME REAL DEPTH BEHIND THE PREACHING OF THESE EASTERN LIGHTNING PEOPLE
YOU0000005780_S0000121 THEN THEY WILL ALL START TO FOLLOW THE EASTERN LIGHTNING
YOU0000005780_S0000127 I WILL LOOK INCOMPETENT
YOU0000005780_S0000134 BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT JUDGMENT BEGINNING AT GOD'S HOUSE THE EXACT SAME THING AS THE JUDGMENT BEFORE THE GREAT WHITE THRONE IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION
YOU0000005780_S0000143 WHY NOT TELL US EXACTLY WHAT THAT JUDGMENT IS LIKE
YOU0000005780_S0000149 PLEASE SISTER EXPLAIN THIS TO US SURE
YOU0000005780_S0000155 IT STARTS WITHIN THE HOUSE OF GOD
YOU0000005780_S0000161 THE ABNORMAL STARS IN THE SKY HAVE WARNED US OF DISASTER AND EVEN MORE ARE ON THE WAY
YOU0000005780_S0000168 WHICH MEANS GOD INCARNATE COMES SECRETLY IN ORDER TO EXPRESS THE TRUTH TO DO HIS JUDGMENT WORK
YOU0000005780_S0000175 AT THAT TIME GOD'S JUDGMENT OF HUMANITY WILL COME TO ITS CLIMAX
YOU0000005780_S0000187 WITHIN GOD'S WORD THE WORK HE WILL DO IS SUMMED UP VERY ACCURATELY
YOU0000005780_S0000192 IF YOU LIKE WE'LL EXPLAIN
YOU0000005780_S0000197 YES
YOU0000005780_S0000217 BUT HOW DO WE GET TO KNOW GOD'S AUTHORITY
YOU0000005780_S0000224 HIS COMMANDS WILL STAND HIS WORDS COUNT
YOU0000005780_S0000244 IT CLEANSES AND PERFECTS ANYONE WHO HAS RETURNED BEFORE GOD'S THRONE
YOU0000005780_S0000250 NO FORCE THAT EXISTS ON THIS EARTH CAN DESTROY GOD'S KINGDOM
YOU0000005780_S0000259 THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT GOD IS ALREADY RULING FROM HIS THRONE ON EARTH
YOU0000005780_S0000269 GOD'S JUDGMENT THAT STARTS WITH THE HOUSE OF GOD IS THE JUDGMENT BEFORE THE GREAT WHITE THRONE
YOU0000005780_S0000274 HE BROUGHT SISTERS TO GIVE US TESTIMONY OF ALMIGHTY GOD'S WORK
YOU0000005780_S0000282 AND THUS EXPOSES ALL THE PHARISEES WHO HATE THE TRUTH AND PRETEND TO BE GOOD
YOU0000005780_S0000291 I CAN'T HELP BUT BE CONVINCED
YOU0000005780_S0000300 YOU MUST BE TIRED FROM TALKING TO US FOR THIS LONG
YOU0000005780_S0000312 THEY'VE STOLEN OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE IN LESS THAN A MONTH
YOU0000005780_S0000319 IF WE WANT TO KEEP OUR MEMBERS
YOU0000005780_S0000325 I KNOW OUR BELIEVERS WILL BE AFRAID TO MAKE CONTACT WITH ANY OF THEM
YOU0000005780_S0000330 THEN THAT CHURCH MUST CALL THE POLICE
YOU0000005780_S0000336 YOU KNOW HOW THEY PERSECUTE CHRISTIANS
YOU0000005780_S0000343 AND THAT'S NOT ALL
YOU0000005780_S0000348 THAT THE CCP IS SATAN'S REGIME
YOU0000005780_S0000353 IF THE EASTERN LIGHTNING IS THE TRUE WAY
YOU0000005780_S0000358 THROUGHOUT HISTORY THE CCP HAS ALWAYS SUPPORTED EVIL AND OPPOSED GOD
YOU0000005780_S0000363 OVER TO THOSE EASTERN LIGHTNING PEOPLE
YOU0000005780_S0000370 WE CAN NEVER JOIN HANDS WITH THE CCP
YOU0000005780_S0000376 WOULDN'T WE
YOU0000005780_S0000383 WE'D BE PERSECUTING GOD AND HIS BELIEVERS
YOU0000005780_S0000395 YOU KEEP SAYING THAT OUR CHURCH WILL FAIL
YOU0000005780_S0000400 DOESN'T THIS DESERVE MORE THOUGHT
YOU0000005780_S0000405 JUST THEIR GOLD THEIR WEALTH THEIR HIGH-RANKING POSITIONS
YOU0000005780_S0000411 AREN'T WE ON THE SAME PATH
YOU0000005780_S0000416 WE WILL BE CURSED BY GOD
YOU0000005780_S0000422 BUT I KNOW I WORKED HARD TO BUILD THIS CHURCH
YOU0000005780_S0000433 WHAT'S GOING ON
YOU0000005780_S0000441 SOME OF THE NEW BELIEVERS HAVE BEEN WEAKENED AND MADE PASSIVE BY THEIR PASTORS AND ALL THE TRICKS THEY'VE USED
YOU0000005780_S0000450 HELP US SPREAD YOUR GOSPEL TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN
YOU0000005780_S0000455 THIS HAS NOT BEEN AN EASY TRIAL NOT FOR ANY OF US HERE
YOU0000005780_S0000460 PASTOR ZHENG ALSO LISTENED TO YOUR TESTIMONY OF ALMIGHTY GOD'S WORK IN THE LAST DAYS
YOU0000005780_S0000467 HE TELLS US TO BE HUMBLE
YOU0000005780_S0000473 YOU CAN KNOW A MAN'S EXTERIOR BUT NOT HIS HEART
YOU0000005780_S0000482 AND THE WORDS HE UTTERS ARE THE TRUTH WHICH CONVINCES EVERYONE
YOU0000005780_S0000506 NO ONE BELIEVED THAT THOSE IN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD WOULD OPPOSE GOD AND HIS WORK
YOU0000005780_S0000511 WILL USE CERTAIN DOCTRINES THAT CELEBRATE THEMSELVES
YOU0000005780_S0000517 THEY'VE MADE UP ALL SORTS OF RUMORS TO OPPOSE AND CONDEMN ALMIGHTY GOD AND TO CONTROL THEIR BELIEVERS
YOU0000005780_S0000522 THEY'VE TRIED TO STEAL ALMIGHTY GOD'S WORDS AND THEN WITHOUT SHAME WORK THEM INTO THEIR OWN SERMONS
YOU0000005780_S0000528 WHAT YOU'VE SAID IS RIGHT
YOU0000005780_S0000534 TO CAGE AND CONTROL THE BELIEVERS
YOU0000005780_S0000540 HOW COULD THEY CHOOSE TO GIVE HELP TO THE CCP AND FIGHT ALMIGHTY GOD
YOU0000005780_S0000547 WHEN JESUS CAME DOWN TO EARTH
YOU0000005780_S0000553 EVEN WORSE SOME WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES THEIR LIVES DESTROYED
YOU0000005780_S0000560 IT SHOWS THE RELIGIOUS WORLD IS LIKE THE DEMONIC REGIME THEY ALL BELONG IN SATAN'S CAMP
YOU0000005780_S0000586 THEY'VE CHOSEN TO BECOME ALLIES WITH THE CCP AND RELIED ON THEIR EVIL FORCES
YOU0000005780_S0000592 PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION FOR THEM TO ARREST US
YOU0000005780_S0000599 THESE CURRENT RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARE JUST THE PHARISEES OF TODAY
YOU0000005780_S0000605 IT'S SO TRUE THAT HIS WORK CAN REVEAL PEOPLE
YOU0000005780_S0000611 NOW I CAN SEE THAT THIS IS THE GREAT SALVATION
YOU0000005780_S0000617 THEN THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO FOLLOW HIM EVEN MORE
YOU0000005780_S0000624 HAVE YOU SEEN THIS PERSON
YOU0000005780_S0000630 YESTERDAY
YOU0000005780_S0000637 HOW COME I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU AT THE LAST FEW MEETINGS
YOU0000005780_S0000642 THE FACT THAT THE CCP HAS BEEN OPPOSING SO HARD ONLY TELLS ME THAT THIS IS THE TRUE WAY
YOU0000005780_S0000648 IT'S REALLY TOO DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE
YOU0000005780_S0000654 PEOPLE CAN BE ARRESTED
YOU0000005780_S0000659 EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAID IS TRUE
YOU0000005780_S0000664 IT'S BECAUSE WE KNOW ALMIGHTY GOD IS THE TRUE GOD THE RETURN OF THE REDEEMER
YOU0000005780_S0000671 IN THE LAST DAYS ALMIGHTY GOD COMES TO SAVE MANKIND FROM SATAN'S INFLUENCE SO THAT THEY CAN RETURN TO GOD'S PRESENCE
YOU0000005780_S0000678 LOTS OF PEOPLE CAN SEE IT CLEARLY THE CCP IS DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO FRAME AND CONDEMN THE CHURCH OF ALMIGHTY GOD
YOU0000005780_S0000683 IN THE END IT'LL TORMENT US TO DEATH AND SEND US ALL TO THE FIRES OF HELL YEAH
YOU0000005780_S0000688 THE CCP IS GETTING SCARED BECAUSE IT'S AWARE THAT ONCE ALMIGHTY GOD'S WORDS SPREADS AMONG PEOPLE
YOU0000005780_S0000693 IT WILL NEVER HAVE A PLACE IN CHINA AGAIN
YOU0000005780_S0000698 BROTHERS AND SISTERS
YOU0000005780_S0000704 COWARDLY PEOPLE CAN'T ENTER GOD'S KINGDOM
YOU0000005780_S0000709 SHAMEFUL
YOU0000005780_S0000716 FULFILL OUR DUTY JUST STRIKE BACK AT SATAN AND PUT IT TO SHAME

YOU0000005780_S0000731 OH SISTER
YOU0000005780_S0000736 SISTER LIN
YOU0000005780_S0000742 WHILE STILL REVEALING AND ELIMINATING THOSE WHO DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN GOD OR LOVE THE TRUTH
YOU0000005780_S0000747 THEY CAN HATE SATAN
YOU0000005780_S0000754 THOSE WHO SINCERELY WANT GOD NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY'RE PERSECUTED OR HOW HARD IT MIGHT GET
YOU0000005780_S0000760 THEY SEE THAT THE CCP IS DEVIL WHO SEEKS TO CORRUPT SPREAD AFFLICTION
YOU0000005780_S0000766 THEIR LOVE FOR GOD GROWS THEIR HEARTS BECOME CLOSER TO GOD
YOU0000005780_S0000773 AS THE LORD HAS SAID
YOU0000005780_S0000794 THE KINGDOM OF GOD WILL FINALLY BE REALIZED ON EARTH
YOU0000005780_S0000799 BUT IF WE WAIT UNTIL THEN TO BELIEVE WE'LL MISS OUT ON THE CHANCE TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO OVERCOMERS BY GOD
YOU0000005780_S0000806 WE MUST SPEED UP OUR EFFORTS
YOU0000005780_S0000814 WE MIGHT HAVE ALREADY GAINED THE TRUTH AND LIFE WE HAVE TO STOP WASTING OUR LIVES
YOU0000005780_S0000822 BUT NOW GOD'S KINGDOM GOSPEL HAS STILL BEEN SPREAD THROUGHOUT MAINLAND CHINA
YOU0000005780_S0000870 AND NOW I NO LONGER FEAR THE CCP
YOU0000005780_S0000878 THAT'S RIGHT
YOU0000005780_S0000886 ONLY BY BELIEVING IN ALMIGHTY GOD CAN WE GAIN ETERNAL LIFE AND ENTER GOD'S KINGDOM
YOU0000005780_S0000894 BROTHERS AND SISTERS
YOU0000005780_S0000899 HE GAVE US AN INVITATION TO COME TO THEIR MEETING PLACE AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT ALMIGHTY GOD'S WORK IN THE LAST DAYS
YOU0000005780_S0000904 SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT ALMIGHTY GOD'S WORK IN THE LAST DAYS TOGETHER
YOU0000005780_S0000912 AND MERELY WAIT FOR HIS OPEN DESCENT WITH THE CLOUDS
YOU0000005780_S0000917 THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT GOD'S WORK IN THE LAST DAYS
YOU0000005780_S0000924 LISTEN EVERYONE
YOU0000005780_S0000930 WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE SLIGHTEST CLUE OF ANY OF THAT
YOU0000005780_S0000937 WHEN IT COMES TO THE RETURN OF THE LORD
YOU0000005780_S0000942 IF IT WASN'T SO THEN NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE AND ADMIT IT TO BE GOD'S OWN WORK
YOU0000005780_S0000952 THIS IS WHAT EVERYONE THINKS OF GOD'S WORK
YOU0000005780_S0000959 BUT NO ONE PUTS ANY FOCUS ON LISTENING TO THE VOICE OF GOD
YOU0000005780_S0000965 BY THE TIME PEOPLE REALIZE THIS GOD WILL HAVE ALREADY MADE THEM THE OVERCOMERS
YOU0000005780_S0000971 A MAN WHO WOULDN'T BELIEVE IN GOD'S MIRACLES UNLESS HE SAW THEM WITH HIS OWN EYES
YOU0000005780_S0000979 YES WE SHOULD BE WISE VIRGINS
YOU0000005780_S0000987 GOD'S WORK IS TRULY INCREDIBLE
YOU0000005780_S0000993 HE ARRIVES IN SECRET TO PERFORM HIS JUDGMENT BEGINNING AT THE HOUSE OF GOD
YOU0000005780_S0000998 A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THEY NEED TO SEE A BIG COMMOTION FOR IT TO BE GOD'S WORK
YOU0000005780_S0001004 AND WHY DID FEW RECOGNIZE THAT LORD JESUS WAS CHRIST
YOU0000005780_S0001010 MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND LONG FOR THE TRUTH HAVE ACCEPTED THE WORK OF ALMIGHTY GOD IN THE LAST DAYS
YOU0000005780_S0001017 THAT'S RIGHT
YOU0000005780_S0001022 UNLEASHING THE MILITARY AND COPS TO SUPPRESS THE CHURCH OF ALMIGHTY GOD THEY HUNT CHRIST AND ARREST BELIEVERS WHILE CONDUCTING A FULL-SCALE SWEEP
YOU0000005780_S0001030 DOES THIS COMMOTION COUNT AS SMALL
YOU0000005780_S0001037 ANY PERSON WHO'S A BELIEVER IN GOD AND SEES THE CCP RESISTING GOD TO SUCH AN EXTENT CAN SEE THAT THIS DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN BY RANDOM CHANCE
YOU0000005780_S0001048 THEREFORE PEOPLE NEED TO PUT ASIDE THEIR OLD IDEAS AND STUDY THE WORK OF ALMIGHTY GOD
YOU0000005780_S0001054 GOD WILL BE THERE AS WELL
YOU0000005780_S0001060 YES IT'S TRUE
YOU0000005780_S0001066 HIS EXPRESSING THE WORD IS THE WORD APPEARING IN THE FLESH
YOU0000005780_S0001072 HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT CHRIST IS THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
YOU0000005780_S0001078 MANY PEOPLE ALL ACCEPT THE TRUE LIGHT AND FOLLOW THE TRUE LIGHT
YOU0000005780_S0001083 BUT THE BLIND SIMPLY WILL NOT SEE IT
YOU0000005780_S0001089 LET ME READ A PASSAGE OF GOD'S WORD
YOU0000005780_S0001107 AND FROM THE FOUNDATION LAID BY JESUS' REDEMPTION ALMIGHTY GOD HAS PERFORMED HIS WORK OF JUDGMENT BEGINNING WITH THE HOUSE OF GOD
YOU0000005780_S0001112 THEY SHOULD QUICKLY ACCEPT IT AND OBEY GOD'S WORK OF THE LAST DAYS
YOU0000005780_S0001121 SURE
YOU0000005780_S0001126 SO WE SHOULD ALL BE RAPTURED DIRECTLY INTO GOD'S KINGDOM
YOU0000005780_S0001136 JESUS ONCE MADE THIS PROMISE TO US
YOU0000005780_S0001144 WE'RE STILL FAR FROM BEING CLEANSED
YOU0000005780_S0001150 NOW WE HAVE THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE TRUTH LET'S ASK THESE SISTERS FROM THE CHURCH OF ALMIGHTY GOD TO FELLOWSHIP THIS ASPECT OF THE TRUTH WITH US
YOU0000005780_S0001155 BUT FROM GOD'S POINT OF VIEW
YOU0000005780_S0001161 LETTING US ENJOY A CERTAIN PEACE AND HAPPINESS
YOU0000005780_S0001166 THE WORK OF JESUS' REDEMPTION WAS JUST TO PAVE THE WAY FOR GOD'S JUDGMENT IN THE LAST DAYS
YOU0000005780_S0001171 HE STILL CAN'T HELP HIMSELF WHEN HE COMMITS SINS SO OFTEN
YOU0000005780_S0001178 AND THEN MANKIND WON'T BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE COMPATIBILITY WITH GOD
YOU0000005780_S0001230 IN THE AGE OF GRACE JESUS ONLY DID HIS REDEMPTIVE WORK
YOU0000005780_S0001235 THAT IS WHY MAN STILL CAN'T HELP BUT GIVE IN TO SIN AND TRY TO RESIST GOD
YOU0000005780_S0001240 OUR SATANIC NATURE DIRECTLY OPPOSES GOD AND IS IN DIRECT ENMITY TO THE TRUTH
YOU0000005780_S0001245 CAN'T WE THROUGH SUFFERING SUBDUING OUR BODIES AND RESTRAINING OURSELVES RESOLVE THIS SATANIC NATURE OURSELVES
YOU0000005780_S0001250 ALMOST NONE
YOU0000005780_S0001257 MAN MUST ULTIMATELY GO THROUGH GOD'S JUDGMENT
YOU0000005780_S0001262 FROM THIS WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S GOD'S JUDGMENT IN THE LAST DAYS THAT CAN THOROUGHLY CLEANSE MANKIND AND SAVE ALL OF MANKIND
YOU0000005780_S0001268 AND TRIED TO RESTRAIN OURSELVES FROM SINNING AND DISPLEASING THE LORD
YOU0000005780_S0001273 THE REDEMPTIVE WORK OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WAS TO FORGIVE MAN FOR HIS SINS
YOU0000005780_S0001278 IT SEEMS
YOU0000005780_S0001285 WHAT YOU'VE SHARED WITH US TODAY MAKES A LOT OF SENSE
YOU0000005780_S0001290 IF WE STILL HAVE TO FACE JUDGMENT WHEN THE LORD RETURNS
YOU0000005780_S0001295 YES OUR SINS HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN BY THE LORD
YOU0000005780_S0001300 HOW COULD HE ALLOW THOSE WHO SIN OFTEN AND RESIST HIM TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
YOU0000005780_S0001305 THE LORD IS ALREADY INSPECTING US
YOU0000005780_S0001310 THEN MAN'S SATANIC NATURE WILL NEVER REALLY BE RESOLVED
YOU0000005780_S0001316 LET'S READ A FEW PASSAGES FROM GOD'S WORD
YOU0000005780_S0001373 THEY'VE ALL BEEN ARROGANT
YOU0000005780_S0001378 WHAT THIS SHOWS US IS THAT MAN DOESN'T HAVE A TRUE KNOWLEDGE OR FEAR OF GOD WE KNOW THAT'S A FACT
YOU0000005780_S0001386 FALL DOWN COMPLETELY BEFORE GOD AND THEN TRULY REPENT
YOU0000005780_S0001391 IT'S BECAUSE GOD HADN'T PERFORMED HIS JUDGMENT OF THE LAST DAYS YET
YOU0000005780_S0001396 IN THE AGE OF GRACE PEOPLE GAVE UP EVERYTHING TO PAY THE PRICE AND WORK FOR THE LORD
YOU0000005780_S0001401 SO THEN WHY WHEN MANKIND IS SPENDING FOR THE LORD
YOU0000005780_S0001406 THEREFORE GOD'S WORK OF JUDGMENT BEGINNING WITH THE HOUSE OF GOD IN THE LAST DAYS IS THE WORK THAT'S TARGETED AT MAN'S SATANIC NATURE FOR THOROUGHLY CLEANSING AND SAVING MANKIND
YOU0000005780_S0001413 WE START TO DESPISE AND CURSE OURSELVES
YOU0000005780_S0001418 WE WON'T DO AS WE PLEASE OR SAY WHAT WE WANT FOR FEAR OF ANGERING HIM
YOU0000005780_S0001425 AFTER WE'VE EXPERIENCED GOD'S JUDGMENT WE ALL REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ALMIGHTY GOD UTTERING WORDS TO JUDGE US AND CHASTISE US IS NOT MEANT TO PUNISH OR DESTROY US
YOU0000005780_S0001434 GOD WON'T PERFORM JUDGMENT ON ANY OF THEM
YOU0000005780_S0001440 TODAY'S FELLOWSHIP HAS ENLIGHTENED MY HEART
YOU0000005780_S0001445 THAT GOD'S JUDGMENT OF CORRUPT MANKIND IS SO HE CAN CLEANSE THEM AND SAVE THEM
YOU0000005780_S0001451 THEY'RE ALL LICENTIOUS
YOU0000005780_S0001456 EVEN THOSE WHO HAVE BELIEVED IN THE LORD FOR YEARS ARE FOLLOWING THE SINFUL WAYS OF THE WORLD SINNING AGAINST LORD
YOU0000005780_S0001462 IT'S TRUE
YOU0000005780_S0001469 IT SEEMS ALMIGHTY GOD IS TRULY THE SECOND COMING OF THE LORD WE FINALLY SEE THE ONE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR PRAISE THE LORD
YOU0000005780_S0001475 IN THE AGE OF GRACE NO MATTER HOW LONG THEY HAD BELIEVED PEOPLE LIVED IN A SIN-AND-CONFESS STATE
YOU0000005780_S0001481 WHAT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND IS HOW DOES GOD PERFORM HIS JUDGMENT TO SAVE MANKIND AND CLEANSE US IN THE LAST DAYS
YOU0000005780_S0001489 ALMIGHTY GOD HAS SPOKEN A LOT IN REGARD TO THIS ASPECT OF THE TRUTH
YOU0000005780_S0001535 AND WE CAN ALL FEEL THAT GOD'S WORD JUST LIKE A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD IS JUDGING AND EXPOSING OUR GOD-RESISTING SATANIC NATURE
YOU0000005780_S0001540 THOUGH WE BELIEVE IN GOD WE WON'T LET GOD BE EXALTED
YOU0000005780_S0001545 WHEN WE FACE DISASTER WE EVEN BLAME GOD AND OPPOSE HIM
YOU0000005780_S0001550 IF OUR DESIRES ARE SOMEHOW NOT FULFILLED THEN WE ACT NEGATIVELY OR SLOW DOWN AND QUIT WORK
YOU0000005780_S0001555 WE'RE ALL DEEPLY ASHAMED AND REMORSEFUL
YOU0000005780_S0001560 AND REPENT TO GOD
YOU0000005780_S0001567 WE ALL KNOW AFTER WE HAVE EXPERIENCED GOD'S JUDGMENT THAT GOD NOT ONLY USES WORDS TO JUDGE AND EXPOSE US
YOU0000005780_S0001572 WE SEE THAT OUR NATURE IS TOO STUBBORN
YOU0000005780_S0001577 THROUGH OUR ARROGANT NATURE WE DO WHAT WE WANT
YOU0000005780_S0001582 GOD'S WORD WILL REPROACH US INSIDE
YOU0000005780_S0001587 THEN OUR HEARTS CAN'T HELP BUT TREMBLE IN FEAR
YOU0000005780_S0001593 AFTER EXPERIENCING MUCH OF GOD'S ACTUAL DEALING AND PRUNING AND HIS DISCIPLINE
YOU0000005780_S0001598 WE DO OUR BEST TO EXALT GOD TESTIFY TO GOD
YOU0000005780_S0001605 AND WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT GOD DOES WATCH OVER EVERYTHING AND DOMINATES ALL
YOU0000005780_S0001611 THE CHANGES WE'VE ACHIEVED TODAY ARE THE RESULT OF EXPERIENCING ALMIGHTY GOD'S JUDGMENT OF THE LAST DAYS
YOU0000005780_S0001619 AND CAST OFF OUR SINFUL NATURE
YOU0000005780_S0001629 AND TO RESOLVE MAN'S SINFUL NATURE
YOU0000005780_S0001634 THEN WE WON'T BE ABLE TO KNOW OUR OWN NATURE AND ESSENCE
